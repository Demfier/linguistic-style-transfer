i am all by myself no help
if i can smile a crooked smile
swear to destroy the beasts stamping the ground
but when you are walking down the street
you will meet a stranger some night
to know if i am doing it right
to the music of the sea
and slam the door on me
i ca not keep my eyes open
ooh tell me bird of paradise
there is something happen'n up ahead
now she ai not more than five foot two yeah little liza
the three dwarves peering through their wagon is hind
i am physically going to waste
the brick jail doors that closed behind are cracking
the sky was rolling blindly on
as i pushed my foot down to the floor
what am i trying to say
bang bang now you all ought to be in pictures
and if you cross your fingers
but the baby can the baby can
where are the paths your heroes came?
strong emotions can tip the scale
here i am on my own
well i am looking at you
i balance on a wishing well that all men call the world
no one to witness but they will someday
this voice console is a must
if it is all falling down
there is a groan there is a cough there is a rustle of cloth
i am knocking on death is door
the government will never find the money
do not take a slowcar to china
i am just paying my rent every day
be holy again i gave her
i will have to keep you in your place
are we that blind to see?
his arm now like coild s-s-s-snakes
you see us together chasing the moonlight
the sidewalk regrets that we had to kill them
i do not know if i can do it
we have reached a full stop
i never did like her taste
and it pounds from within and is pinning me down
you do not need them anymore
i feel you your precious soul and i am whole
say something nice to the people edward
i always hear that crazy sound
and the boy was something mommy would not wear
please do not tear this world asunder
where they tell you what to do
it happens in the tunnel when i let myself feel
and here i am wondering why i did it again
to be right in that photograph
look what a fix you put me in
this prayer is for you my love
swears she knew it now she swears he is gone
i see the beauty in the world
watched from the window with a red mosquito
at the end of a weary day
and a tooth for a tooth
is it me it is all about?
who need radar? we use scent
me and the telephone that never rings
i can drive down the road
another is arms another is arms
i have got an old bone and a biscuit and so much love
orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time
for the hotel queens and the magazines
i have never seen that blue before except in one place
am i the ghost in my dreams i do not know
but fool enough to lose it
drawn like moths we drift into the city
is any killer worth more than his crime?
then love lies abandoned and bleeding
'we can change the world' she said
it is the way i am feeling i just ca not deny
for those who think and feel
just when i think i am king i must admit
ca not you see it is misery
he will never need to deal another
with your mother in so much pain?
i will admit i was unfaithful
oh i never meant to cause you trouble
you torment the birds and the bees
collecting table and chairs and sofa and so on and so on
and the light shines in your eyes
and i still get no answers
but i do not really care - i shot my wife
and the way the story started
you know you have got to find a way
full of dead leaves bits of twisted branches and frozen garden
you have thrown the worst fear
it is a balance on the edge of a knife
i wrote it in a letter carved it on a tree
as they ride with the tide
i wish for you the moon
he is movin' down the street-now
i never got around yet i tell it my soul
you think we have been here before
i am cured when i am by your side
they open doorways that i thought were shut for good
toc-toc qui est dans ce bebe?
i want to live life and be good to you
when you are not feeling holy your loneliness says that you have sinned
something you would like me to do?
you better pray o tender prey baby tender prey
lately i have found myself losing my mind
you told me love is blind
when i wo not be around i am going out?
black betty did not mind bam-e-lam x
said i would be sitting here for the rest of my life
give me your heart i am so quickly gone
the secrets that set them apart
do you mean this horny creep
let me be weak let me sleep and dream of sheep
and jane came by with a lock of your hair
please say you wo not forget me
you lose your grip and then you slip
i do not know what is good for me
follow the nile deep to much deeper
ask who does this belong to?
i am trembling you heal me
i could pretend nothing really meant too much
closer than others i was your i was your man
not pushing you down and all around
rain it down on the wife and the kids
just being alive it can really hurt
all of this and her dark hair
i will be the blood in your veins
i have traveled each and every highway
do i have to come right out
all of the boys and the girls
you know these hands will never wash
the lipstick the shadow the silicone
i know i have had enough maybe far too much
it is the fire that lights itself
you who wish to conquer pain
and with all your magic i disappear from view
head tell me make it alright
if love is a piece of dust shining in the sun
to you is it movement or is it action?
and as her young man dies
that are hymns to the glory that is you
i keep him in a book by my fireside
is keeping me waiting keeping me waiting
telling me that you have made money
she wears a dress of gold and red
catch the witness catch the wit
whoa babe i said i am coming
i know you knew on the day you were born
fame fame what you like is in the limo
all that we live for you will regret
blacks and bays dapples and grays
i am on the top i ca not get back
on the first day of may i took to the road
he is addicted to the time track
to see her clicking tongue crack dry
thank you guys very much for supporting us so much
and say 'i will mention that name'
but still something is missing i cannot say yeah
what about me how do i know that your love is true?
but you have been there before
til one day i returned and found they were the
all the stars will glow bright lay me low
call it sleep call it death call it what you like
oh oh oh oh oh oh
i am in a groove now
coming in with the golden light
when you choose the precious few
get the town talkin' fire gang
gone gone the water is all gone
maybe in some kind of dream
all i want is the truth
i wonder if i will suffer more
all of the stars and the outer space
it is hard to breathe it is hard to breathe
scratch and scrape this heavenly body
the streets you are walking on
for i might just stop loving you
forgetting all i could not do today
it is a whole lot more
wounded in the line of duty
then i am sick and no one can cure me
i was talking to a firefly
i felt so lost and disillusioned
and i will say it again
lost and unloved a forgotten messiah
broken leashes all over the floorwhy do i
i used to think i was some kind of gypsy boy
rose is a rose of splendor
you said that to love me you must set me free
well i see you standin' there
you sure mean a lot to me
suppose i abused you just passing it on
i can understand where you are coming from
this is your shadow on my wall
you have got strength enough to stand
living in the black of your soul
you have got me singing to you
have not got a death wish just want a little more
cause she ca not switch off now that she is joined the gang
nobody is right if everybody is wrong
outside my window the world has gone to war
the sun give over to splendour
oh i think you will find
and your heart that is bruised but bleating
say i will be your man
playing our songs for the highest bid
you got the rest of the union to help you along
how come cars do not slow?
here the tension always slows twice
from an ancient book i took a clue
she moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
i have got the bad news beat
i thought i heard someone screaming thought i heard someone screaming
you might not not think so now
soon there will be nothing left of me
i lifted her head she looked at me and said
i am a fool for you
who in solitude who in this mirror
with a ticket to burn and burn and burn
will leave me standing in the rain
