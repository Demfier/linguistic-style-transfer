now i am opened wide and afraid of breaking
you came out of the night
hoping you would do something wrong
not to intervene when it came to you
he says it used to be a farm
hold you feel you in my arms ever again
too important to us we would be lost without you
then i find it in you
since you have been gone away
show me beauty but there is no peace
and here is a note from lenore
the air raid shelters are blooming clover
i do not have any answers my friend
it is just the state i am in
what i will give you since you asked is all my time together
i have gotta tell you in my loudest tones
chocolate-covered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard
i would come flyin' back to you
keep on riding north and west
but i do not want to leave
the fading melodies ca not beat my need
and her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
i could feel it go down
i kiss her open mouth and i praise her beauty
the kind of places you have been living in?
and mary rising above it all
i am still waiting for you you know
walk the bridges before you burn them down
my head is in a whirl and i will love you till tuesday
let the ocean dissolve away my past
with the help of the good lord
ai not what i see with my eyes
a wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
then into another you only thought about last night
now you are waiting for someone
you keep them in business just supplying you
the world will join together for a farewell song
do not stop do not stop say it  more time
the x-ray is her siren song
sometimes friends are not the friends they seem
all i know is that i love you so
walk the streets of their hometown
so like a star upon me
but said she would read them anyway
she do not use much though that is smart for a car
why you close up shop so late?
i get funny dreams again and again
so the subtle face is a loser
what i am really tryin' to say is i ca not get enough of you
not knowing what on earth there was to know
she was given to me to put things right
i have emptied out the peopled halls
from the heart of our land
and the men they dance on the polka-dots
it is over 'cause it is older than the midnight
he is a god he is a man
is telling us she is having your baby
it was a miracle i even got outta longwood alive
get out of the cold water
i am coming 'round when they do not know the facts
clean cut so we are sounding fast
i wo not be be afraid
it is yours now it is all that there is
i ca not tell when i am not being real
this old world has been good to me
open up your eyes for a big new suprize
the woods eats the woman and dumps her honey-body in the mud
i do not want to limp for them to walk
would you please put down that telephone?
no time to questionwhy would nothing last
you are going straight to hell
the stars are caught in our hair
o you can run! you can hide!
jazzer drop your axe it is jazz police!
though laws were carved in marble
meanwhile some kid blows my head off
and whatever happens what really matters?
do not let them tell you that you owe it all to me
the weather is grim ice on the cages
we are close we are hurt
all my tears cried against her milk-white throat
can you say what you are trying to play anyway
i ca not believe that i am here
there is nothing here to win or lose
i expect to find him laughing
just wishing that i had just something you wore
in the world that you transform
she said nothing is leaving here alive
and i see a child laid slain
ca not you see it is not our place to decide
and he cannot take his wife with him
but the suburbs have no charms to soothe
it did not always feel that way
she said that you gave it to her
a glimpse of what is beyond
as i come clean i i
would you break even my wings
is what you say about society
it is far too late to dial police
the struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb
we could build a building site
some fought themselves some fought each other
yet be cut down before the time
stuck his gun in alice is back
i know i could be something if i held on
the thoughts of you sends me shivery
for life is but a thing of terrible gravity
are just a shining artifact of the past
and all the clocks in all the world
yeah we were dying of frustration
through every word that i speak
all that is left is the fear
you know that i wo not be a liar
all of the elephants lie down
it is hard to imagine it is hard to imagine
but did not we have fun?
i heard voices behind the door
make me feel all right now
just like a man of leather to whom i may be related
and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
it leaves a trail of tidal pools
and his shadow learned to love his
and the dagger stick as the doors keep shutting
and i will watch while you are lowered
and i have been putting out fire with gasoline
heaven has denied us its kingdom
ye yeah somehow it is the biggest things
as it gets wetter and wetter
it is a place where you did not belong
filling my spirit with the wildest wish to fly
he touched you with his fingers
do not have no cameras in the big room
while i sing my sad song
then i came upon a river
still there is a great life
now he movin' down my street
all the suit coats say there is money to be made
stay by me stay by me
but i wo not let you down
all your games are played and the clock keeps turning
is the strength of the common touch
you will live a hundred years
you left town to live by the rifle
a word or two my friend
the phone rings and i knock on wood
and pointed his finger at me
it is big and it is bland full of tension and fear
when i am without i stay in my room
whoa back of the roadhouse we got a little bungalow
we burned out and the line went dead
all that is sacred comes from youth
for he still smilesand he is still strong
and i ca not touch your name
let is rock till we explode
no way to save someone who wont take the role
father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
i think that is well understood
childhood days in a simmer haze
could you climb right over the top?
lay down by my parents whisper
as long as they are able
you know i wo not forgive
that wants to play that game
o you know that i must say goodbye
mister wo not you stay a while?
well there she goes my friend she is rolling down at last
i do not have a choice
and the wheels are turning and turning
ah but what good would that bring
when i look in your eyes
wednesday morning ca not believe my ears
but fooling around it will make me sad
i was alone and far away hey
is this love some kinda love
or with my shepherd who will bring me home
who in your merry merry month of may
down here it is made of wood and wire
but that is always been your call
and you sang about the view
i pledge to my grievance to the flag
i said all my faith to see
going home i am going home
because in my dream the girl was very young
oh yes i can yes i can
we may not be good looking
we build our defenses a place of safety
for his nerve is to serve but the sevice is a mockery
and she says 'time to make me cry'
i was cold but not insane
corduroy pants and an old plaid shirt
but it chooses the uphill climb
come on over and sit right down
banni de ses foyers banned from his hearths
green sleeves it is so easily done
jazz police are looking through my folders
do not laugh babe it will be alright
like the leaves around a tree
one man stands the edge of the ocean
i would lie to god if i could make him believe
she gets me out of bed a-crying get a job
it was a good day and an evil day and
evolution the solution or the certainty
do you want to give your blessing to his power
i do not believe in long goodbyes
how can he remember who he is talkin' to?
do not grab that scabby hand
diving off a rock into another moment
hoping that dreams would bring her back it is sad
on the horses of the carousel
time moved so rapidly i had no hope
they urge to build these fine things
now she is gone and you are alone
carry your world i will carry your world
'cause i know where they have been
i can hold the future in my virtual hand
i would do anything for you
and when the clothes are strewn do not be afraid of the room
you are the sun and as you shine on me
i want to feel you hesitate
in a distant pair of eyes
blame is better to give than receive
think of this as mercy a small gift from me
you sold me illusions for a sack full of checks
and i just ca not seem to get enough of
oh no oh no i will be your sister
but did you ever call my name
what have you got to say?
someone who will stand by my side
i was born in ontario ontario
in his room with memories for days he faced
and her black hair framed a happy heart-shaped face
truth is the flame we must learn
but i just could not let myself go
and in a way i am yearning
gonna better leave her alone put you down son
i ca not find nobody who
you are a man you understand
they do not dig anything - dig everything
stay for a while leave without a trace
lily oh lily i do not feel safe
let is keep it on the level
by the flashes of artillery light
and i will always be waiting for you
i searched the seven seas and i have looked
when they put me down below
i have faced it a life wasted
and his holiness is proof it is said
i pull out the plank and say
i do not want to face
funny how he always seems to fit in
by the middle there ai not gonna be any middle any more
and you will rise again someday
when will i see you again?
sayin 'at no time may both feet leave the floor'
let is drink one more before i die
will you look into the future?
rise you ca not be neutral on a moving train
a pleasant faced man steps up to greet you
but my baby is so vain
its filth it sticks like glue
the gates of love they budged an inch
then you put me in a place
dancing with you all the time and do not you think that it is a crime
with our incomparable sense of loss
ten silver saxes a bass with a bow
and once you are gone you ca not come back
we travel in the dark of the new moon
the water is edge of stone
the way you hold me tight
you thought that it could never happen
i will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together
it is the color of your heartbeat
we are islands to each other
there is no surprise at all
i hear the voice of evil
we played out an all night movie role
how can they invade it when it is so complicated?
i am gonna come on out
if you are looking for a reason i have a reason to give
got to spread love around got to spread it all around
life is a power that remains
across these sad waters and across my heart
in the rise and the set of the sun
it could count right up to eleven
to the tower where the blessed hours chime
come on back to me come on back
his woman threw him out in the ice and snow
look in the shadow to see
it is just that i ca not speak
as we open up the gates of the garden
my self control is missing - check it
show them the way that you feel
start again i heard them say
i scape the clay off my shoes
just tell her not to come here anymore
but well be around some more
these last two verses are not sung by nick but are part of the original song
oh and all i taught her was everything
there is no god so pray to me
you you are all i want to know
i do not know what is good for me
like spirits they vanish at dawn
it is a lot like you
will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?
you do not have to stray
the people on my hill they say i am lazy
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
nothing seems to make a dent
some people go for those sultry evenings
weaving down a byroad singing the song
mean street you let me down
you can climb a ladder up to the sun
do you need it do you?
i make my rye whiskey but i wo not tell you where
too wasted to write my own
it is a part of us
stealing light from what is beneath
i see the birds in the rain
yes i say it is to stay on top
each time we turn a new corner
now her life is on fire it is no one is concern
and the planes came crashing down
oh so romantic swept me off my feet
they travel in the time of the prophets
is my world not falling down
they will ride you down to the gutters
she plunged him into well water where
and there are many parts of me to touch you have your choice
and i will try not to kiss you
they read me gurdjieff and jesu
and the rain came hammering down
wo not you come and talk to me
it was a voice without a name
when every thought you are thinking sinks you darker than the new moon sky
try to not spook the horse
its peaks are cold as ice
there are those who think that
standin' at the crossroads tried to flag a ride
and here where there is no description
if you go if you go
and when the broken hearted people
a man can never dream these kind of things
i feel it fall for you
if i could make the change
build her up and let her down
and it was sweet and it was good
living in a fish eye lens
and i will feel good in my revenge
lord i did not have no sweet woman ooh well babe in my distress
lick the dirt off a larger one is feet
i ca not follow what you have planned
and there are no diamonds in your mine
the man had my woman and the blues had poor me
it is so deep i do not think that i can speak about it
and we do not know what we are doing here
hard hard on the door until
slap that baby make him free!
you are the only one who cannot forgive yourself oh
say you have got no-one tonight
and you will carry me down on your dancing
it is just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea
ten bottles standing in a row military style
guiding my way with its light
am i in trouble with the jazz police?
and i do not like the set so
it is been a really fun year and
fade away where the sun cleared out
a whisper a whisper a whisper
from you and i am blessed
my road it may be lonely just because it is not paved
do not want to wait for heaven
how many nights i prayed for this to let my work begin
i just like to please do not like to tease
it is easy just to look away
under the leaves away from the party
the key to heaven is door
i am the concierge chez-moi honey
baby i would give you my world
'cause it is changing in the big sky
i try to fight it but there is no defense
i do not know at all
i am here to waste my life away
but they are too few to mention
all the things we should have done
i could not wipe the smile from my face
and he said woman look-a here woman
lack of choice saw to that
i know i could be something had i held on held on
that he is what he is and what will be will be
it is love back to front and no sides like i say
oh i will keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
you are not sure what is going on here
original version of henry lee nick is version is also available
seeing love mentioned many thousand times
someone to fool someone like you
i have got to keep my veil on my face
when i was a wee thing i heard my mother say
full of dead things before they reached the car
will their boyfriends pass this way again?
a ragged cup a twisted mop
then i would fly to you
love her love her love her
come on turn me loose turn me loose
how love in silence becomes reprimand
i tried so hard to stand
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
driving away to the east and into the past
and it ai not my crime
nor does he care for you to sit
dance magic dance dance magic dance
some write your name in the summer sky
for the finger points at me
and i wo not show or feel any pain
the countless feasts laid at my feet
with no shoes on his feet
i was going round and round the hotel garage
another dodo did not hear it from me
and he will show you his teeth
if i ask you one more time
hank williams has not answered yet
it is all who you know
except in one you are fulfilled
ignorance is well and truly blessed
there is nothing left to do
would not wanna waste a thing
sometimes i wonder was she ever there at all
why i have seen it everywhere
i ca not say much has happened since
fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
you better run and run and run
i am looking for a girl
ken is the man that we all need
everything i have bought with you
in a world that is never safe
you have read it in the tea leaves and the tracks are on tv
every time you gave them shelter
i have got a long way to go
that the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
i was born with the wrong sign
it is such a cloudy day
are the reasons i ca not
it is not the world that is heavy it is just the things that you save
i would cry the whole day through
though all your sweet goodbyes will fall upon deaf ears
i am the poison that feeds life to you
like squirming flies on a pin
and all these words alone is nothing like a poem
homos roaming the streets in packs
where love must go hiding at last
hans plays with lotte lotte plays with jane
somebody listening to what you say
sliding out of reverse into drive
stop children what is that sound
they stood at the stage door and begged for a scream
i will be your one possession
and said send me a songwriter
all they need is one tortured soul
fuck it we will disappear now
some big ceremony was going down
stardust trail leading back to you
yes you better knock knock knock on wood oh knock on wood
and i do not even think of the bronze
barkeep said yeah i have heard your name down the
this morning will be wiser than this evening is
you were planning to stay in you had it carefully planned
it is all the other way round
there was no rein to check me
she is got to talk about romance
while time outran you and trouble flew toward you
in the month you have been away from your parents' home
the shutters lifted in inches in temperance building
'no visitors allowed in rooms by law! '
if reality is what i see newspapers mag-azines tv
pursuing your frenzy in ritz or savoy
i will be the in to your sane
vaporize the memories that freeze the fading past
stretch your arms across the storm
that it is tough to be so cool
the night has a thousand saxophones
that is another thing i would do
the baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
you have got a full house in your head tonight
oh baby do not you go
meet me on the road meet me where i said
ai not no whirlwind below your wing
sometimes when we smile we tell the same lie
does he fly away or just talk about it
wo not you take your leave
if you lie beneath my shade i will keep you nice and cool
like you would do for one that you love
or maybe which voice i ignore
oh see the men of action falling back
ca not see the sense in crying
to crawl high above the foam
oh i hope you run into them you who have been travelling so long
at the counter of a store
i will give you daylight for a friend
pushing my luck gonna fly like a mad thing
wots life to you to me is hell
my army of one is gonna fight for you
but my neighbor is my enemy
crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
where did i lose you babe
i saw you on the steps in paris you were with someone else
but i am just so tired of this loneliness
if i had not ripped the fabric
your hands were raised up to the sky
the one i am using now it is covered up
but i did not want to win
you are air that air that i can breathe
you were there to show me
now only love can break her fall
all they need is your last confession
a think tank of aloof multiplication
i know where i am going
oh and i do not have a soul to save
worship the sun when it is high
and though their love was hangin' on a limb
to carry home my little soldier
oh blue jean is heaven any sweeter than blue jean
every man and woman decides to hide the conspiracy behind global armageddon
you are the one my only true love
when she saw the ocean for the first time
to decorate a mammy is hero
and he liked them quite a lot
this is the place to grow old till
and you do not know that you have been born
oh i am gonna buy this place and start a fire
is an image of the way i feel
and your child on the phone
grandma is okay not the same since grandpa is gone
and history will soon forget about you
why wo not you let me die with some kind of honor?
hey that is no way to say goodbye
ah give or take a night or two
do not bring me down do not bring me down
this hmmm grace is my name
all the warheads in its wake
but i ca not pass this time of day no
you are good enough to heat
her dress floats down the well and it assumes the shape of the body of a
fly by night away from here
my lost my lost was saying found
are only there to make you bleed
all outward motion connects to nothin'
seven lies multiplied by seven multiplied by seven again
once i was your hearts desire
and go take that california trip
everybody knows that the boat is leaking
thought is of crashing all those pictures
it is a war in paradise
tell me why is it so do not wanna let you go
come on and feel the need in me
and when you try to they make you say please
i walked into this empty church i had no place else to go
pull the blinds and change their minds
is it because i lied when i was seventeen?
plain gold ring is got a story to tell
what it is ai not exactly clear
you could hear the crickets in the thickets call
then she drew the curtains down
when you are head over heels and the magic is gone it is impossible
can you find it in your heart
as though they were the burden of some other
these chains of sorrow they are heavy it is true
this house is full of full of full of fight
they travel on the road to redemption
you are gonna like the way you feel
and the sun is shinin' in her eyes
oh get me on my feet
wipe away your tears of confusion
and the troubles i have seen
just as the morning calmed the storm--
i will whisk them up in no moonlight
you got what you gave by the heel of my bootie
well i used to be so happy
i could see their frightened faces
as i stumbled and fell to the ground
where secrets lie in the border fires
even when you are far away
i am gonna run my way to you
i watched them sink before your gaze
tell me the meaning of love
but i ai not seen the green grass on a dollar bill
who would believe she would be so devious
and that is what is appealing
you step out of line the man come and take you away
oh feel it oh oh feel it feel it my love
you see jack and jill they are going to join their misery
we go driving into the moonlight
every time i try to walk through walls
i mean is this what you wanted
do not drink from that cup
whisper these things are not true
but still we do not head the bill
i told you when i came i was a stranger
we were married under cherry trees
i am deep inside something and i may never come back
do not punish me with brutality
there is nothing i can do now
on the path of least resistance
why do not you come on back to the war you can still get married
i know it is over before she says
when he was six he believed that the moon overhead followed him
domination is the name of the game
i wake with the sparrows and i hurry off to work
there is no one left to torture
and i know that i am flying
and all our dirty clothes that had not gone into the wash
lost in the rages of fragrance
before it starts before i begin?
stick 'em up show us your pocket hypocrisy
you much prefer the gentleman i was before
soon the fighting turns to weapons
ooh the thrill and the hurting
i ca not explain you would not understand
knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
but do not you wake them up
i guess i will go back to my place
i meant it as a kind of trial
he could only love you it is sad
i just feel this sense of mission
newspapers meant enough to me yeahno
look how she welcomes him into her gown
and the things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us
and then you hide from my eyes
at the top of this palace-like place assembled with almost apparent
full of folk who do not know me
his face burned in the retina of your eyes
but i am glad you have come around
let him tell his book of lies
and whisper the words with that cynical charm
though nothing nothing will keep us together
is all that you would love to be
take a page from the red book
he thought he did not know
have brought me down upon my knees
and the three of us walk out of the hall
and when she is dreaming i believe
still i seemed so obsolete and small
i will come home again but not until
all the boys all the girls
and all the gods in the universe agree
and i knocked that fair girl down
i take it on the road
it is a long long romance
i lie in her arms and says when i am gone
how he would kick it in the head
and the mercy seat is melting
than perish with the sad men roaming free
your love has shown me proof
and now shooting into the night
ca not believe her telling me she is dead again
did not nobody seem to know me everybody pass me by
a distant ship is smoke on the horizon
and he was alright the band was altogether
and they grab up all the light
but if she says she wants me tell her i will be there
but when you think i have had enough
may it be a shield for you
and i am sick of pretending
yeah the women tear their blouses off
you are just a game and it has won
the big bangtook and shook the world
the child belonged to none of them
but they have been closed to hide the flames
i am taking a swing at this shadow of mine
a lover is secrets in the uk
when the chain reaction was done
and he jokes about his broken english
lonely nights i dream you are there
maybe fate wants you dead too
my sense of timing is not quite - ok
you do not need a voix in the dark
you can fly through the sky
i keep thinking that our problems
for my soul to comfort and keep - my sleep
i have seen you in the movies
dancers writhed and squirmed and then
that is how i remember home
i can taste the tears falling
i said thank you girl thank you girl
i would tell her not to care
if i were to say to you girl we could not get much higher yeah
yo bro tell us what is happenin' um i am on the west
so i look too and what do i see?
showing up to me without a scent revealing
for the worst it had come true
there is a stow-away with my throat
was letting go not taking part
we were walking up to strawberry swing
i know you really loved me
slow degrees on the dark horizon
to the fact that mommy did not care
is that too much to ask for?
i wish i was a child again
how can i ever change things
if i get there before the snow flies
she said father mother sister brother
every heart to love must come
the wind lifts me to my senses
take me oh baby grab me
i will get him and i will not miss
until my days my days are done
it is got wires that vibrate and give music
wo not you take a walk with me
who is the leader of the glc?
there is a sound in the calm
well it kind of struck me funny
tell him take no more she practices her speech
oh yeah all day all the way
one hand on the banister a flower in your hair
the black ones tryin' to be a skinny one
and death reckons huckleberry is time is up
sing yeah for the beatle and the stone
you hurt my reasons to try
see the light bounce off the rocks to the sand
i do not know what is wrong
and if you are coming jump
mystic rhythms -- under northern lights
yeah there will be an answer
i am not sayin' that i do not believe you
may the lights in the land of plenty
her hair the black that black can go
do you hate mankind for what they done to you?
when the moon begins to rise
a truant finds homeand i wish to hold on
there is someone who is loved you forever but you do not know it
you can make the most of the distance
a human being that was given to fly
i dried my eyes to greet the day
police arrested magic and magic went with them
she was tripping on organic acid
i am not quite sure what you are supposed to say
you will walk right out the door
i got  more minutes to go
will you spank her with a mechanical corset
and in the end what is it all about?
like a beast with his horn
to the desire that consumes me whole
one just escapesone is left inside the well
that is not a picture that your memory paints
and the night has stole past
come on back if the moment lends
when the days were the days were the days boys
i thought i could run alone
and see him trampled beneath their feet
gone gone gone spinning slack through the end?
if the great eyes of my god
there should have been a moment
it is already more than enough
but some sit in silence they are just older children
i held her in my cheap arms
not in the tower of song
and gave it all she gave
oh i forget everything i learn
kneeled to let his kingdom rise
you quote from 'anxious' and things we do
parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties
i been sleeping far too long
and you could say you did enough
and try to get it on like once before
and i know what i must do
then at last it is your right i know i swear
she struts across the bar hitching up her skirt
he may be lying i ca not tell
he will rekindle all the dreams
and i spent the night with the queen of spain
but you do not really care for music do you?
i can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
the spreading fear of growing old
and so i want to join in
with her hand in his hand
and do not let the ship is flag down
fear is just in your head
now my head wo not stop
mama can we stop and give her a ride?
this world has left me broken inside
if getting up means going down again
if i if i have been unkind
come on little fucker can you let me out
a girl who would murder her own true love
and i will never get enough
she is gone  miles it is very far
so pray to me i am the lord is new disease
the more i take a look inside the more i am fried
the sea would crash about us
drove she ducklings to the water
and so you see that i am completely crazy
who will put up their sword?
you will never get her you are a fool
when at night the nurses left
but now i am doin' my own thing
so keep it out the papers
but you always get your way
i love you without caring whom you love
and strugglin to summony one of her looks!
baby baby do not blow away
so take her for a spin
with a letter and a prayer
well now my story is over baby
but alas i was no swimmer
you know how easy it is to tear it apart
where is the man that we all need?
the solitary mourner of a prince
sights set higher than the tall church spire
everything i do it is just comes undone
and he wants so to belch
would not think to look at me
now go get sunday is slave
i wanted the night to go on and on
to have the girl of their dreams
stronger than the song is hit
and by all that i have done wrong
have to wonder what it sees
we must throw ourselves wide open
them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
with just a hint of mayhem
i said that i will be loving you always
going do da do going do da do
one touch is all it took
to stand within the pleasure dome
ca not see my tracks your scent way back
i see you have gone and changed your name again
in the dawn in the dawn
we will leave the world behind
you give me life please do not let me go
girl is good you better treat em true oh yeah
i got a new song to sing
another early morning i would pretend that it was you
she turns me on but i am only dancing
a million candles burning for the love that never came
ca not tell them apart at all
but i can fly i close my eyes and i can fly
but you ca not trace time
like lovers and heroes birds in the last days of spring
you can never break the chain
i know a crowd who only lives after midnight
and i wonder who you are waiting for
if i want to sometimes and i ask
do not gimme no lip i am just not having it
it really do not matter much
'i am still looking for rhythm'
then taken back the punch i threw
and it did not make a sound
and me i am trapped inside
and of what was following me
can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy
and those who push us down that they might climb
you sometimes have to listen to
i would like to take you take you to the ceremony
and the moon is a slender crescent
and now you offer me eternal darkness
and baby i think i am capsizing
if you feel at a loss man just who is the boss-man
she goes down on her knees
we do not take anything on faith
but ah kno that to possess her
this is the track of deception
brother in your doubt and fear
a pack of wolves wanted their money back
i said if love was so transcendent
i am gonna see my friend
they can give you back your hope
some people seem so obsessed with the morning
she knows what i am thinking
crazy two timing bitches running round
sometimes it almost makes me cry
and we worked in the morning light
then i got myself a factory job
i got some things i gotta do
'cause they were making crazy sounds
and you came home without lili marlene
jazz police i think i am falling
i know that it was wrong
i call it magic when i am with you
if it were but a matter of faith
i ca not hear a word you are saying
for suddenly i saw you there
one ca not see to have enough
joe is mind is full of motors?
no better than the faulty line
you searched through all my poets
so many hearts i find broke like yours and mine
our little son wo not let us forget
as i walk down the aisle
of the sermon on the mount
but not in such an obvious place
it is us against the world
a specter on a roller coaster
in a dream of hungarian lanterns
dog yearsfor every sad son of a bitch
oh please let me sleep it is christmas time
looking out on a big green lawn
you do not mind a little investigation humiliation
the wrong questions with the wrong replies
he wrote it in a letter
you ca not tell yourself how to feel
i do not know if i can stop it
when you could be taking me
he is the riddle of the music
is all that we need to be
your lips cut a smile on your face
tell me what are you singing
you young things never stay young for longe
we can build a world of wonder
the woman in blue she is asking for revenge
how will the man who made chemicals difficult
quite by chance near the phone
and never again will my letters start
'tis now that you would call me
i got you so much i am scared
and you will find you are called to come forth
can sit around here doing nothing everyday
we will be dancin' 'til the mornin' comes
but there is left and right
i am always willing to learn
then we can move out one by one
enough of throwing your arms around
and put me in death row
ask the blood of one of it is bad days
in another state of consciousness in another state of mind
every man who looks your way
by the white trees dressed in double true
and i will be flying like a free bird
i guess you are right you always are
the buildings that you put up
to help yourselves to a friend
it is a gift for the giving
they are gonna pass me to that house above
i ca not read and i ca not write down
you are going love what you will find
the ones you left our friends deserted
the streets groan with little caesars
i know it is hard to reach you
he is cleaning up the systems
no i am gonna love her way
it shone just so upon the edge
i could fly into the eye of god on high
what to say what to say
black road long and i drove and drove
and a letter in your writing does not mean you are not dead
or is it always at the wrong time
and they are handing down my sentence now
when i get home i am gunna see my little boy
lhuna ca not you hear how much i am suffering?
keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheel x
with your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
and the women all were beautiful
with great expectations i change all my clothes
and she is sweet another know why
and it is ice-cream and jelly
that i love her love her oh love her
well i am a worried guy
she rules my house with an iron fist
oh chosen love oh frozen love
in the zi duang provence of eastern country
and we are all here to lie
and it is stopping at your face
or you can come to terms and realize
and it ai not a duty either
judy he is the sweetness of the sweetness
and pull it out and run
ca not go to your friends
there is nothing i want more
its the rich man gets the girl
when i get home i am gunna call my mother
my babbling mouth would wash it up
i will have faith in man
you are not the only one
on my very first night with you
from a window in the tower of song
when you hear that rooster crowing
they will bury you in velvet
in a place you have forgotten
they is goin' from door to door mmm
and he told her everything that she would done that she would done
the waiter is an old man
ah she is really out of this world
out here in the fields i fight for my meals
yes it is true shining wine
devils feed on the seeds of the soul
junkies wo not get radio time
just as long as i can get to kiss
i have found a picture that haunts me again
i wander lonely to the sea
if i were a musician i would harp on just one thing
and now i rub my eyesfor he has returned
but i am too scared to move
to her hair white as snow and her pale blue eyes
bacause your robes are covered in mud
for better or for worsea best we began
if he came back which one would you choose?
maybe one day i will fly next to you
but we only make it crazy
and the rock must stand alone
if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
it is just a burning inside
it is all state of mind
so i close my eyes and drift into sleep
who by his lady is command who by his own hand
when all the bones are buried
if you and i are one
as i cut through the saw-mills and the stacks
and the hungry little boy with the runny nose
and i will do it all the time
and hold hands with weeping strangers
you cool my brow with your tears
he peeled his shadow off in strips
but that is all right sometimes
and i took a i took a walk in space
hear my words 'cause emotion now is leaving
you got a right not to kill
mystic rhythms -- under city lights
if you ever come by here for jane or for me
and all the thoughts i have had
my shadow is never far behind
and though the air was thin and cold
stare at the fugutives caught in the crossfire
as he opens the door she rolls over
i had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
bound for living on the edge
i am gonna buy me a little car
they do not scurry when something bigger comes their way
and the holy spirit is crying where is the beef?
then he wrote himself a prescription your name was mentioned in it
i will give your man the words to rule the world
you have been hiding from the big lie
into it is great shadowed vault i go
so you will never grow old to us
and you are not wrong to
got another good one on the line
there is never love without pain
i love the country but i ca not stand the scene
and a crimson carnation in her teeth
i have been walking a thin white line
we are the service the pleasure skin
my lady of the various sorrows
but i must help my mother stand up straight
do not die my funny little darling!
let me shoot across the sky
deeper that the knife goes in
that i am told not to
where just a couple of pigeons are living
and when you find it you will keep it
vii the waltz of the shreves
you hear the sound of my breathing
i will never be a saint
we can find someone to love
to our love let all the jilted lovers cry
come on baby do not let it break your heart
he is got a problem with his powers
in a world where all must fail
i have no welcome for you
i close my eyes to the cello solo and ache
ah you should have seen us
you do not have to cut the lawn
yes you better knock knock knock on wood yes i better
he was on a real low down bummer
in games without frontiers-wars without tears
let is pick up your will it is grown fat and lazy
too many hands on my time
he had a need to discover
sometimes i feel like a kid
ca not go to your brother
and do those hairy bears shhh
i might make it up to detroit city
they were looking for love at second sight
golden years gold whop whop whop
getting some skin exposure to the blackout get some protection
you are such a heavenly view
he sensed worry could be strength with a plan said time for
and just when is seems as though
such a rush to do nothing at all
and say the mea culpa which you probably forgot
hey you are such a pretty boy
when first i heard him speak
and a little pot of glue
the way it is got to be lover
you might say that we are young
like a baby in your arms
the archer must be sure of his aim
and you give me your love
god is afoot god never died
all along they are sayin' mind your manners
is this place at your command?
while my fingers pushed into her straight black hair
and here you are before me in the flesh
you know i ca not explain
i live on memories that are hard to find
seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned
all the love we could have given
it is supposed to niggaz i told you
i bet you are so surprised to see me
i will ask for the mercy that you love to decline
to serve him for a year
and the day returns too soon
old man lying by the side of the road
but you think you will make a hero
my dog runs awol i blame you all
computer geeks in the school house
that you will be coming home for christmas
try and sometimes you will succeed
let is take the whole of the world
i only want you  have some fun
the doctors working day and night
sometimes they try to forget and sometimes they do
no one believed what she had seen
i could not fill that hole
whipped into shape now they got you in line
of a moment we both knew
these shoes do a kind of voodoo
lost in your men and the games you play
yes every maid he came upon he thought it was his dear
the captain ca not hold her x
dressed her in a cheap red cotton dress
and streaked with tears of rage
written by cohen performed in night magic
hold my head inside your hands
in the angel wars oh lord
i am a bad motherfucker do not you know
where he had control as far as the fall
here am i more roche five than pain
a cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest and a queer
yeah i have been sitting upside down
he insists that he piss in your fist
i do not want to be tied
waiting to hear footsteps that say:
we have a woman for a mayor
one day when you talked to me
oh when it rained and it rained
i feel i should i guess i should get real get real
i would rather lose than forgive you
she mocked his female fashions and his working-class mustache
when i was a young boy i tried to listen
yes i feel a little bit nervous
you can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her
for every tool they lend us a loss of independence
why my mind is moving so fast
or make you feel i belong
there are many here among us
as you are taking me home
it is this that brings us together
well take it out in hate
coming forth to claim their prize
well i am down here babe with the eskimos with the polar bears and the
for you i would bleed myself dry
i said i would best be moving on
packed his bags his heart in pain
and i am wondering what you are gonna do
but if i did i would summon them together
wish that you were here beside me
and the flies that cloud her eyes
little sadie loved her little toy soldier
still i ca not make you dance
it is a crown of thorns
now i know life is worth
shoutin' for his dog that lay dead on the side of the road
it is gonna be so good now
my pussy queen knows all my secrets
and my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight
when you see a famous smile
there is a crack a crack in everything
you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
i have no welcome for talk
you will know that i am just trying to understand
we will go far tomorrow out of sight ooh
not a soul on the ice
out of bed and he dreams in the shower
i still try to run on
this flood will swallow all you have left behind
i will be there by your side
there was nothing left to view
yeah baby baby yeah i will give you baby baby baby
when the sun burst through the skies
yes i have read the morning papers
to take me anywhere in seconds
you used to feel that way
she wants to see with your eyes
sayin 'credit tommorow!! ' or 'want credit?!? haw haw haw!! '
knowing you ca not lose what you have not got
the city all lights up and you are nowhere
i o you you do not own me
i am gonna tunnel through denial
we have had enough of this blind man is bluff
i have got a feeling a feeling deep inside oh yeah oh yeah
and it is my favorite piece
darling you are the punishment for all of my former sins
they laughed and laughed and said
staring down into a heartless sea
ah am still here rolling and i am left on my own
you have conspired inspired me to
oh lord just let him see me
why do i keep fuckin' up?
does not mean you have won
do not play the game of time
i have got someone who cares for me
and we are both caught off guard
jump magic jump jump magic jump x
here for the wonder of under the stars
cause i will stop trying to make a difference
if you will only if you would only say yes
i will kill you if i can
for you i have waited all these years
yes i am still so afraid
tumbling like a cloud that has drowned in the lake
hey hey ai not that right
point the figure-head at the storm
i do not want to lose you
and you do not know me:
said you took a big trip
i been walking on a road of rocks
come on and feel the need
you just ca not play the clown
i would like to be a gallery
but reality was not told to me
pay no more than a glance
and you could not keep warm
in  who could ask for more
a war between the black and white
fill your heart with love today
as i walk these narrow streets
only in your mind-forget your mind
in the darkness of the night
when it started we were alright
take a look at you and me
goodnight my darling i hope you are satisfied
surely you do not love them?
you wo not remember me but i do you
we are meeting for the first time
those whose claims were steeped in peace tranquility
come so low with the kneeling
a place you can escape the world
only your mind can take you out of this
like he is riding on a motorbike in the strongest winds
mars ai not the kind of place to raise your kids
and save it all for me
would like to frame your voice
visions of swastikas in my head
i was the king of the alley mama i could talk some trash
wherever you are i will find that treasure
books and jealousy tell me wrong
by claiming god as his only rock
oh the press still hounded you
i saw you behind the wall
just tell me what it is
down at the port i watch the boats come in
we can be heroes just for one day
i hope that you can just let it go by
you can bet that it is true
behind the wall a fat man snores
and i do not know what is good for me
one in your belly and one for rudi
how could i not lie there with you?
together but we were miles apart
and i believe 'cause i can see
a chance to break from the past
searched through the books on human behaviour
the world weighs on my shoulders
all you ever seem to say is
so you know how much i need you
another time or place another civilization
alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
when the die is cast and you have no choice
'cause they are free of thoughts unpure
clutching at the straws of respectability
a woman is education but he is not a woman yet
i thought you were the crown prince
pound the drums with martial beat
it ai not too hot but it ai not too cold
can truth come out of lying
the phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
though we live in trying times
to be done with all this measuring of proof
how many times can you say you ca not believe what you learn
she left her home in arkansas
that you are goin' to the top?
it is not a race it is a journey
i felt his hot breath on my neck as i dove into the heat
she had often begged me for
you should not question at all his authority
you let me love you till i was a failure
we have gotta get it all together
once i am begging you save her little soul
they chose me to save your soul!
i kneel down by your grave
i was lucky to get a job and some pay
the wind is blowin' through our hair
steeped in the history of london
but someone had put the flares up
does not mean i will stop
to where the water and the earth caress
unique to every city is streets
just running scared afraid to lose
if i do not run into my baby a train is goin' to run into me
this house is full of m-m-my mess
with a view towards its preservation
and you wonder when you wake up will it be alright
just to see what all the fuss is about
fate is just the weight of circumstances
now the clasp of this union
god picked up a giant hammer
got to make our own key
if you do not like the answer forget it
is you got to be free
take my hand as we go down and down and down
two thousand zero zero party over
do not let it tie you down
it is falling it is falling
he is big and pink and not like me
when we tire of our own company
oh the night it is thick my defences are hid
the dj says 'who are you?'
and she is living down there
my broken hearts my fabulous dances
you do not know what it is like
watched it weeping but i made it stay
were laid spread out before me
i will ruin everything you are
her cheeks - they were like roses
see it shinin' in your eye
i send my best to you
when you have got something to teach
what is got the whole world fakin' it yeah?
it is just time to pay the price
so badly in need of repair
with my face pressed in the clover
fill them up with precious cargo
did she wake you up to tell you that
in the betrayal of his love he awakened
no supernatural beings from a supernatural place
for a new lease of life
and two forces two forces collide
say hello to the greater men
you do not need to listen to strangers
i ca not get what i want
i was the fool because i thought
who will lay down their hammer?
much gold and silver light to spill
wandering the face of the earth
mommy--why does everybody have a bomb?
all the demons used to come around
so many decisions a million revisions
with half a mind on what they say
but i am nothing on my own
i want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car
the wars they will be fought again
give them moon and cloudless sky
you who build these altars now
right now they do not care at all
on wednesday i sat down a-talking
i have felt you coming girl as you drew near
for all the sorrow it will pass my dear
i will have faith or i prefer
but if i catch you standing on my toes
my soul is on the line
the smell of flint and steel
though it is plain as can be
i walked these streets with you
i used to love the rainbow
i did not see the crevice yawn no
looks like she is always goin' home
and is this is my final chance of getting you
well you will never see a sign hanging on the door
and everybody knows that you live forever
that god has kept from me
earth was flying through the sky
ah read her diary on her sheets
and it seemed to me that most
i have got something to show you
and drunk the milk of paradise
like a film i have seen now show me
keep staring at the annihilation gun before it is too late
he is a woman at heart
i fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad john finn
she said do not trust dreams
and a little piece of rope wo not hold it together
in a world that was small i once lived in a time
or stay all night with thee
i ca not trust anything you say
i was brought up to believe
up those stone steps i climb
got a woman that loves me
to seek the sacred river alph
wants to fool with other guys so i let her
with any girl who knew me
has taken all my ups and all my downs
shine on the truth some day
how important it is for me
oh! rye whiskey rye whiskey rye whiskey i vow
i was hiding dear hiding all way
do not try to d-d-dig what we all saytalkin' 'bout my generation
and across the room inside a tomb
live and you die in the blink of an eye
they make it look so good
my skirt floating up around my waist
but you keep leaning in on me
i will burn the soul of a man
if you wanna know what agony is
and now you are trembling on a rocky ledge
let your heart be the anchor
i just hear that crazy sound
i got my mind on something else
i want to tear your dreams away
well do not you worry buddy
going to shadow myself in a veil of gloom
wo not be long before i stop and play it over
i will give life to obsession
and drive around my faster car
i am not tryin' to cause a b-b-big sensation
everything they say seems to sound new
but the world you left behind
does peace come out of fighting
well i dreamed i saw the silver spaceships flying
just pictures of jap girls in synthesis and i
i will love her till the stars
hannah montana does the african savannah
ah no need for the rein
and wound the clockworks so to tighter
and the child bride in her nighty
changing the house where you live
the pull and the push of it all
he waits hoping for a presence something anything to enter
suddenly my feet are feet of mud
this do not mean nothin' no more
why nothing even turns out how you planned
every road is a ray of light
you know that i go very quiet
i do not know if i can move
it is a bike what a surprise!
that pink paper pinafore that you keep mending
but i am driving my car down to geneva
try into the sun you do not know why
in the rings of her silk in the hinge of her thighs
a day of coincidence with the radio
and made it impossible to speak
you are a little mystery to me
the grudges you have held for so long
i wanna wake up with no-one around
i get so cold on those nights down south
and who by avalanche who by powder
a picture of you a picture of you in uniform
they want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
wonder how the dollar went down
jo the waiter smiled at me
with a picture of my car
we wo not see her no more
in spirit i will be there
strange compulsions that i ca not control
then the sun would leave your pretty face
my face the picture is changed
the speaker talks of the beautiful saves
with nothing in common with no problem
now i am a satellite of a free state
destiny took me in her arms and told me:
like a pair of vagabonds who wave between two passing trains
we are busted in the blinding lights
now let your mind do the walking
just so i could call again
we get impatient as the time runs out
i would like to try your charity
but they are marching to bastille day la guillotine will claim
i think i need to change my attitude
never shook satan is hand look see for yourself
and i got lots of gas
parcourait en pleurant travelled while crying
miles is very far through the snow
you remind me of the babe
a tide of the human race
the salesman turned to close the blinds
sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
now that you made yourself love me
when the water takes you home
in the heat and in the din
warming the damp and rotten seed
but before i will let that happen
well they call me the workin' man
she was praying to her god
and all the earthly things they stop to play
wires with my other hand i produced my first harmonious
you wo not need to believe
it is over most fuck it so go 'head with it
dreamed i was flying high above the trees
a healing hand a secret touch on the heart
and all her mystery dwelled within her black hair
the sun on snow rivers in rain
some of us live in a cloud of fear
all this time we are talking and sharing our rational view
even i could tell the atmosphere in here was utterly appalling
while the blizzards cold wind and snow
bono: do not punish me with brutality
oh little thing are you looking lost?
do not you shiver shiver shiver
i will win my olympic dream
and so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby
free the people oh got your love whoa x
all at once the torches flare
but the changing of winds and the way waters flow
all this noise inside the quiet
one man stands alone awaiting for her to come home
you approached a high court judge
i must hide from a thousand grinning faces
well all of the little girls that i had little liza
and lettin' me knowhe is a-waitin'he is a-waitin'
nothings what you thought it would be
it lay buried here it lay deep inside me
those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
as she stood their in the doorway
girls they take their loves away
and tell me the good news first
and you are shouting at me
i have seen your fairground hair
andy where is my fifteen minutes fifteen yeah
could you see them screaming and weeping?
baby i got sick this morning
i got a girl ? little liza
and if i ever want proof
do not walk into the crowd again do not walk away again
they ai not said i broke no rule
that you are at the gates of heaven
they have seen it all before
and i hate to fade alone
a town we all know well
know i will come to harm
it was their idea i proved to be a man
and they do not know me
but if you want it from me
we see what we want to see
i will prove that it can be done oh i am so much in love
sunshine entered our frankie is days
his eyes like wheels spinnin' round
a voice more dead than old
and there is no safe port in view
with a mighty expectation of relief
the light in our window is fading
i wish that i was sorry this time
rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
i ate it up and i had to spit it out
grasp and hold onhold tight and fast
just the ghost of a story
i never said that i was brave
i told you that i would come back
i dare you to judge me
at six o'clock i felt so alone
turn your magic on umi she would say
put down the top and let it roll
that left us back where we began
that filthy five! they did nothing to challenge or resist
by questioning all that i do
that you have been sleeping now for years
it could be the wrong move
all of my words have gone mad
that david played and it pleased the lord
i never done good things i never done bad things
and when it is bad i cry
lost in these dreams of you
come on down to the river of sight
and all your work it is right before your eyes
once you start running you keep on running
the evening plane rises up from the runway
something beautiful is happening inside for me
you are the only one who can forgive yourself oh yeah
but you wo not have the sum
it is not a trick your senses all deceiving
and you know the minute i saw your face
to take me anywhere i want to go
no prints left at the crime
and toss them into the ocean blue
there is oil on my hands
i have wanted to do this for years
but the joys of love are fleeting
see how the flower leans instinctively toward the light
here is the hall - that is where you wait for me
i can stare for a thousand years
see the road begin to climb
and though he is to big a man to say
there are times when i feel
he said he who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in
and we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
he were there to wave to you
i said where is my boy?
one man standing on the plains of abraham
this is a secret mauled and mangled
but baby since i have changed
has covered over all the messages it kept
was in the arms of good friends of mine
for only love can conquer hate
you can rest at the side of the road
well annie is pretty neat she always eats her meat
as someone long prepared for the occasion
waiting for the phone to ring
between the dancer and his cane
no one else to care for or love
i make the others run and hide
when you see that secret smile
for god is in this hand that i hold
i am waiting for the night to fall
there will be no road too narrow
i ca not be left to my imagination
and i know it is over a parting of ways
all things move toward their end
she by the hair of my chinny chin chin
with brand new eyes open wide
ideas that once seem so right
there is a yellow one that wo not
that was a great vacation--maybe the best of all
oh the streets you are walking on
he introduced himself as richard slade
everything is dissolving babe according to plan
how long am i gonna stand
doctor doctor i am going mad
i trace the print of your body with my hand
try to breathe but you ca not
orphans of the city moved toward us
so i have sat and i have watched an ice-age thaw
when he focused after his release
look at the light climbing up the aerial
we would have had it all and died
pour on a symphony when i am low low low low
there is no way of knowin'
and all this science i do not understand
just when all the bills are due
i would be there if i could
give me one kiss in apple-blossom
other people than the ones we know and love
and the sluts that they tow
and furthermore i will fuck billy in his motherfucking
who do you think you are?
brown leather boots and an old straw hat
drive down the street ca not find the keys to my own fucking home
growing up it all seems so one-sided
and when she is reading i retreat
alive is afoot magic never died
but you can change the facts
love love love can break her fall fall
and some go for too much stuff
the mother reads aloud child tries to understand it
it is a dream for the waking
through every step that i take
i think maybe you feel the same
i will run with the georgia peach breeze and i will win
you are turning me up and turning me down
i found the love that i knew i had missed
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
the poison sank and it paralyzed my will
born and raised at the top of the south
i will place the moon within your heart
give her all the love she gives to me
then i was just hanging around doing
i am a living act of holiness
oh so exciting go on and on
i have been paralyzed by a lack of feeling
and i am gonna buy this place that is what i said
just what life is all about
i see her now a little tear running down her cheek
do not want to have to take you back
i hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
and i danced on the rooftops
and take the blame for what you did
i am no longer a solitary man
i know it does not seem that way
till i swivel back round then i fly fly fly
i will say good-bye for now
and if the park gates are closed
'cause there is a chance that we might not be so wrong
what i am a gonna do
now i have got things to do
god put a smile upon your face
i see the middle kingdom between heaven and earth
and there is a mighty judgment coming but i may be wrong
deep in the woods a funeral is swinging
feel your feet start kissing the ground
salt water tasted it too long
the mangy cats growling in their cages
i might know what you mean when you say you fall apart
whole it is whole as in wholes
but i am not taken in
he is not a leader he is a texas leaguer
and make sure that he is hungry
it is such a perfect day
i can see pictures of me well
she is got to screen it
i burn a fire of love
where do you go? i get no answer
it is better to burn out than it is to rust
alone in a corridor waiting locked out
i hear her voice say i need you
he could not win the war with ego
for the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
can you tell it to your heart?
with your buildings and your eyes
i went this morning to the cemetery
if i if i have been untrue
way down in l a everyday
so that i would not have to see
what is in my own hands
get down get down little henry lee
he aint got no friend in there
sometimes you ca not explain the way you feel
such a small affair a relapse
i am goin' on a downhill slide
stuff them in a cardboard box
do you know how it feels to love you?
she gave him away when she could not hold no she folded
but the training that he learned
and so i ran away from you
and i am not afraid to die
and how we would wished to live in the sensual world
gone i wo not look back
the black covered caisson her horses had drawn
that we were born to be covered in bliss?
do not take this way do not take that way
it is the best home i ever had
do you see what i see dear?
and you will believe you are loving the alien
and they are handing down my sentence now
all the days i owe you
i got no limbs i am like a feather on the wind
came a-knocking on my door i let them in
it will feel like kicking a habit
prayers they hide the saddest view
so hold me and hold me do not tell me your name
he called my name a love was born
who would do the job if he was built that way
mary take the child the river is rising
the world and then it took
leads to the heart of despair
and i like you more with every day
awakened him to what he could do
but she stopped on a coal-trolley up to new haven
i did not want to let them see me weep
this old airport is got me down it is no earthly good to me
i smiled sadly for a love
all the movie shows - dig everything
the tv she talks to me
and the heart must pause to breathe
with the missing links it do not feel like home now
can i have it all now?
and rubbed jelly on their sticks
nothing can survive in a vacuum
about a ghost from a wishing well
i want to smack but i hold back
i wonder if i am still in love
and i took the small roads out of town
you will want to lose control
yeah i will always be waiting for you
oh oh if i did not i am a fool you see
in the bed where i once slept
while na-na ne-ne-na ne-na-na davy dozed
there is no one in sight
a clever machine writes pretty words
in that palace in the sun
i could try to understand you
let is take a map of the world
but until then i will settle down
cause it is in that moment that you know that
i know that god do not live here in my heart
do not practice dying for real
have the only key to your heart
she keeps saying hey do not hate me
it would be too much to
you did not see me in toronto
if he would seen me round his place
you are here in my head
i got some if you need it
while evil spirits haunt their sleep
i have told the truth i did not come to fool you
and the angels in heaven adore you
she favors the bold that is cold
for she is lived it ten times or more
i got myself a mansion then i gave it away
but not like you and i
it makes me a happy man
the patron saint of envy and the grocer of despair
rain is burning on the forest floor
you held that glass so tight
we are secrets to each other
i am crazy crazy for feeling so lonely
you will never know the poetry you have stirred in me
with my knife in my jeans and the rain on the shield
but i am sure it exists
i know it is already been sung ca not be said enough
i will hold on to the ring
now is the time to make the time
well a man feels proud to give his woman
with your finger in the air
the water is only waist high
to speak of lovers old and new
i was a stranger in the city
i can hear some pop popular musics
you are a refuge somewhere i can go
[too bad] i am not losing sleep my friend
i am rooted like a tree here
see the light ram through the gaps in the land
do not you want to be free
i am a ghost in the dark and i am yours
she came beside me amongst my coat
it is not an act it is attraction
a night bird is following you
he is too busy hitting the vaseline
i do not want a cycle of recycled revenge
a crystal girl i would spy
she will turn once more to sunday is gown
everyone can come if they want to
and wo not easily be converted
cold red beef white cloth by a cherrywood fire
is it contact or just reaction?
it is the same old dizzy hangup
destroy the entire world and get every man and woman out of nowhere
let is get together before we get much older
nothing is ever hurt like this
and i have to think to smile
than a memory on a wall
it does not really feel like christmas at all
taking hold of the hem of your dress
they say no no it wo not last forever
by a carnival of idiots on show
just erodes us in the rain
she said sure i will be your partner
well from sea to shining sea and a hundred points between
he is got a problem with his poisons
sometimes the fortress is too strong
all we are demanding you will supply
anything we should know about your change?
now i can think for myself
the smoky life is practiced everywhere
we are not afraid to love but no new ideas
it is all about my dream
such a fuss to do nothing at all
acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside
after the party you took me back to your parlour
the world is full of answers
but then i ca not be sure
we do not even have to touch
you are up i am down
mon pays malheureux my unhappy country
we raised the tower of babel for you
do you feel like i am supposed to do?
i bought you a pair of shoes
the windows rattling in the gales
well i said will it ever change?
the agents had paid for the black limousine
dance magic dance dance magic dance repeat ad-lib
i cannot put my finger on it now
i just want to see your sweet smile
this mental space is occupied and everything is mine
i am happy hope you are happy too
there is a concert hall in vienna
do you think that it would?
come on it is time to go
her wild feral stare her dark hair
i am so scared i ca not breathe
do not interrupt! do not interrupt!
i viewed the morning with alarm
we generate a rumour that is sick
oh yeah she is leaving you
i must say goodbye to your brittle bones
yeah the hippies all go there
and she ai not about to lose it
i hope you are sitting comfortably
even the lost ones the frightened and mean ones
but we do not have a vocal
with hats pulled low over their brows
he had an ' international and two kids
do not say it was all a waste
leading me on towards a change of heart
they will be dancing dancing in the streets
it is in your heart it is in your soul it is in your mind
we are learning to live with somebody is depression
my back to the gates of the garden
one last cup of wine we will pour
and i toss them a diram or two
i know life would be different had i held on held on
ah the dreamers ride against the men of action
she says my body is the light my body is the way
just another future song lonely little kitsch
we arrive at the launching site
but he can kick like a mule
i do not need a lover
the sellup in the garage in the decks and the stuff
when edith and earl renamed the double e
to be insulted by these fascists
good work is the key to good fortune
only you can try to see
i am afraid i ca not help it
i smell smoke see little fires bursting on the lawns
watch the clock on the wall
you know we have a responsibility
but the penny landed with its head dancing
i feed the lions in trafalgar square and i dig everything - dig everything
i laid down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep
i learned this step a while ago
you ca not keep me here
a traditional song similar to my little boat is empty nick is song is also
she taught him how to dance
i am just a slave here
glorified version of a pellet gun
a blue bird on my shoulder
as she pushed the paper in
ai not got no money and i ai not got no hair
cause if you ever feel neglected
all the things for which my heart yearns
they say there is always magic in the air
we are all weeping now weeping because
when they look in my direction
my missionaries in a foreign field
ca not run from the revelation no party
you i want for my friend
i do not mean to be so nihilistic
you are only coming through in waves
and i ai not no capitalist
wednesday martin luther king dayafternoon in view of nothing
wrong-negative fades-never the twain reckless and tame
and the rivers we swim in are boiling
i do not want to see this no more
oh i got a feeling a feeling i ca not hide oh no no oh no
grabbing at your peril buddy? cause you know you ai not
and come running to my open arms
i owe the man some money
to stop before it gets too much!
and i tightened up my gut
lord lord just let him hear me
said the helmsman to the mate
do not it make me smile?
so let is walk outside the hour is late
saying to you anything you want me to
oh please believe me i would hate to miss the train oh yeah oh yeah
if you are looking for that woman at the house
where their queen above the clouds
we reach out over race and hold each other is hands
some of the boys were feelin' fine
cry cry cry cry cry cry
just say you will wait you will wait for me
the way you make me feel
ah but keep my body here to lie upon
who could stand beside you so close to eden
he is the riddle of my life
with a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you
leaving little lines in the ice
come on and sing it out now now
the well is dry and the streams runs shallow
i have got to put my fear back in its box
oh i wish he would come out
you saw him hangin' on the enemy
and focus on the day that is been
from all the lives you left your mark upon
oh no do not pity me babe
how quick the sun can drop away
forgetting all you could not do today
you win but with less than when you begin
if you want a partner take my hand
please do not make me explain
take off the top blow past the hot spot
i wonder does she call my name
but not if i keep my head in the clouds
around the corner and over the hill
come to me and claim the prize
hey joe where you gonna run to now?
we let him use his powers
he is the one we all can count on
now have gotten hard to say
i would go up on the mountain and call my baby back
we are sailing flailing through the ether
and i laughed and checked her breathing
kneel before my altar and drink the wine of slaughter
it is not a matter of mercy
you are my home now and it is true
i am mad as hell at something
columbia now nine times the speed of sound
chilly down with the fire gang think small
they ran to build their cities
there is that anguish there is that doubt
i could be your assassin i do not know
it used to be so easy
the road goes on and on
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
i have????? my life for olympic platinum
i will be counting up my demons yeah
over the quavers drunk in the bars
i said which way do i turn
and i am breathless without you
all i know all i know
saturday night you look so chic
and this could be my last chance
and i know the mistakes that i made
we shake our heads at the tragedy
in my opinion gubernatorial fear is far from over
i would rather be a tortoise from galapagos
sometimes i wonder if a soul can cry?
with its i will never forget you you know!
where she sprang up from the coffin
are the things they did not do
but i believe there is a ghost of a chance
i learned to lay my fingers across the wires and to turn
now they have changed their tune
it was that phot a fading photograph of
from where the fuck you are at
now you call up every day
we stumble and fall like tragedy falls
well i have been swinging from the stars
with your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls
big money goes around the world
and she moves among the sparrows
as we journey to thy sacred feet
to the thieves of celestial history
he lies to you and deceives
when she is dressed in white
and i do not know what is good for me
she will drive a beetle car
he is a-pushin' i am being pushed from above
the faraway lights rising in the whites of your eyes
then nightmares are real and deceiving
not too much for you to do
quoting sappho in the original greek
michael we were chosen we were chosen
he was tired of writin' letters to himself
for the grace of god in the desert here
to find out what is gnawing at me
we are out of tricks with the silence cutting
so you will scrub and you will scrub
and push them from the pull of the bush
to see flies swarm her hateful eye
make my way on down to that promised land
he would love to spend the night in zion
and let is savour a kiss
but now my heart is aching
and i will i will still take the best you have got
what you really think of me
i will lay before the cross and pray
and say we dig for ore
no it is no cause for concern
oh there is a storm rising
moved moved by a higher love
and this is not my voice
satoria must be something just the same
oh and a nada lada yeah
give me steel give me steel give me pulses unreal
though his mother has given him up for lost
but there ai not gonna be one friend
just to try to earn a dollar
o brother buy me one more drink
it is round about it is somewhere here
he is stealing a god from the israelite
my back is on the ropes
well you are making me crazy
have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
a rocket man a rocket man
never turn your back on mother
you are always saying that there is something wrong
go where i would i can not
the look in your eyes as you head for the door
you know this little girl drives me to despair little liza
thought i saw god dancing in the flames
but come and buy my toys
then you are outta that hole and back up on the street
come to me come to me come to me
protect the disease in me she says
slim tie showdown ca not stop satellite
a thousand years have come and gone
so i knelt there at the delta
within and in the fizzy gin begins to sigh
but right now right now right now i am a-roaming
tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge
for those who wish to seem
a noise your phone is ringing
i will tear my heart out
when the sun goes down and the die is cast
they knew love could not be wrong
do not you talk so fast
while the death toll gets higher
yeah he up and he died
told it to a honeycomb told it to a bee
to let yourself down would be a big disgrace
i needed you i knew i was in danger
who are hing 'round the corners
then one day in the abc
he is bustin' clock he hates it is face
let him put his hands together
all the highs all the lows
we can show you a good time show you a good time
never acted up before do not go on me now
a million dreams a million scars
the sleeproom still waits for me
but he is still heading down those tracks
i am not asking for the sky to mend
giving me all the good lines
but i open up my fist
i was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
when you awake you shall have cake
if you should lie upon that bamboo pyre
yeah rain was fallin' and we are soakin' wet
you can bet that it is true
it could not be once without us
if i could find one to believe in
i know something you want to do
and tonight i know it all has to begin again
spin a thread of precious contact
but this ai not no movie
just put your feet down child
no escaping from the mess we are in
lock away your childhood and throw away the key
hanging by the cross and nail
chilly down with the fire gang
they try to carry on try to bear the agony
could you tell that the empty quivered
and one by one the guests are cast
all the love you should have given
but you do not know where from
and the guards are taking aim
with no compass and no chart
once a month they spot him
the bridge we will build it now
listen  what i am tryin'  say
slip your frigid hands beneath my shirt
i am alone and she has left me
and i hid him in the closet
i have searched the holy books
sights and best of wishes and
i wanna leave em all behind me because this time i am gone
i guess they wo not exchange the gifts
a homeward angel on the fly
but i swear by this song
well i am drowning in time to a desperate beat
a candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed
you shall work your father is land
this is no time for laughing
i was doom riding on top a black horse
because i want it to get harder
and do not let the veil drop
a dreamer of pictures i run in the night
i am going to stay with my friend
how come you called me here tonight?
when she learns of all your lyin'
but she said go back to the world
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
well she is out to slay
read her book take a look i loved her!
she would materialize all fleshed out
and heaven knows what you will find
it is a dance on the edge of life
i never even knew how much i wanted you she said
in my heart she left a hole
lord i am  miles away from home
maybe gotta give her ooh baby baby baby
before i know what it feels like?
oh no oh no cried she that grave is not meant for me
new york is cold but i like where i am living
i was the match that would fire up her snatch
could it be the best could it be?
i am so happy with my righteous self
the boy in the bright blue jeans
you ca not shake it or break it with your motown
do not you know it all the more enraptures me
i knew before i met her that i would lose her
but you see that line there moving through the station?
at evening is fall he watched me walk
i admit it what is to say
could not we talk about something else instead?
and i am ready for it all love
talkin' to herself there is no one else who needs to know
look at that sky life is begun
you are living in the present tense
and god does not care for your benevolence
but some machine keeps on humming
and you have worlds to mend
ca not face life on a razor is edge
and bury the world as it does
who is drifted far from home
when i needed to possess you?
there was a band playin' in my head
and they call as they beckon you on
you think you have got a hold of it all
sick and tired sick and tired
i need a change and i ca not wait
i would like my whole life to be
you know it is not for real he just holds his breath
i saw you in the picture
we are looking at the big sky
i been searching for about a week
when they turn the pages of history
oh well if i ever caused you trouble
you know she was nothing but trouble trouble
i fell down like a goddamn idiot
get back on it get back on it
some of these days and it wo not be long
i do not want to think about it
to kiss her milk-white throat a dark curtain of black hair
sun dogs fire on the horizon
all the good things out in me
from what little sleep they had
but they would not be opened
go through you when you try to hold
but they will wear away your little window love
he had a job to do
it is light enough to let it go
but you do not have the time
who cares what a fool believes?
but she do not know how to use it
and he sinks the burning knife deep
and flying on the ground is wrong
and all the dreamers are waking
the whole valley reeking of wet beast
but since you have been gone
i still have your smiling face
we will lay on the grass
in this sexual noise vicious chords offer joy
everybody is looking for a reason to live
i keep a book of reflections that sometimes appear in her eyes
steer the airship right across the stars
and the atmosphere is too thin
or judge you just pass on through
this is what i could have been
and a portrait of christ nailed to an anchor
all your letters and cards stacked up against the door
i passed by your garden saw you with your flowers
oh dark grin he ca not help when he is happy he looks insane
there were chains so i loved you like a slave
what if there was no lie
so long as you are on my mind
the rich man needs his comfort
the new law is moving in
and now we do what we do
i would wake up every morning by your side
and put it where it was last seen?
the picture kept will remind me
found a love that is true
on a chair with a dead magazine
oh do you hear that sound?
blinded and hurtin' this i am deserving
and you can have your way with me
is heaven just for victims dear?
i am gonna raise a holler
and i am gone gone gone
and time is on your side
i will steal the light from heavens gate
every now and then life says
the head is not the museum it is supposed to be
now i am a going back on that same train
when she is dressed in black
each time we alter the focus
am i a shadow of life i do not know
share your loving and you live so long
while shepherds bless and count their sheep
the sound of breathing and crying hearts
down the road i look and there runs mary
now i look for her always
i have to pay the bill
scarlet for me and scarlet for you
yeah i feel so good i do not know what to do
it seems we can be happy now
take it off he is got three eyes
have you ever heard about the higgs boson blues
while my heart was breaking which one would it be?
wave goodbye to the life without pain
face down i got a gun
learning to match the beat of the old world man
all in order we move into the boudoir
to the mother of all machines
let is talk about this sensibly
and who by fire who by water
and his spark took life in my hand and mmh yes
when you try to they make you say please
the time is now and there is no stoppin' us
and my life upon a thorn
until the showcase trial on tv
so far it has not surfaced
treasured toy and i feel her pain
we know what they are all going to say
now all your possessions all of your things all of your hopes schemes
i ai not never going back
it is like a psychedelic dream
i have sit just behind my window till my cigarettes were low and dug
no sinner need rise up forgiven
i do not know why sometimes i get frightened
a world of red neon and ultramarine
you know i feel so good
they do not look much oh
there is something magical in the air
i am a dj and i have got believers
others like it more when there is fire in the sky
longitudes latitudes it is so absurd
cause if you want me then you can have me
aw come on do not give blood then take it back again
someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
i have got to have your word on this
yeah when i get the paper i read it through and through
leave your regrets and impossible longings
through million times we will remember
he will appear out of nowhere but
now starts the craft of the father
all her gifts for the dance had gone
and they will carry you o'er the walls
i want to hear you laugh
and if it is hard for some we sure could use it now
the vertigo the need to lose
what i really think of you
just goes to show you do not give a damn
there lurks a mysterious invisible force
lift off this blindfold let me see again
in the heart is eternal light
an idiot prayer of empty words
and light on my right knee
to the one who was never never equal to the task
he is got that look of mourning and concentration on his face
if you stay you wo not be sorry
said i want to run like the lions
you will take my life away
no i do not know how to stop
i know i am gone too far
a couple of dreams and he was
took a car downtown and took what they offered me
the dust of cold flowers prison of dark of ashes
it is just that i i do not want to be hurt by love again
though the night was made for loving
as was told in tales of old
i do not want you to change anything you do
waiting so long i have been waiting so waiting so
ca not see the calm until the storm
steer your way past the ruins of the altar and the mall
now the nightingale sings to you
do not try to speed me up
o baby i got you bad
and there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore
but quick flashes of a planned lunch
things that i once dreamed of
oh he deals 'em off off the top ties 'em off
it is a case of cruel to be kind
'cause i doubt i am and i doubt you
i am going out on the ledge
beelzebub is aching in my belly-o
and the meek shall inherit the earth
with his coca leaves and pearls
but i ca not forget where my lips
i ca not forget but i do not remember who
and though i failed at love was this a crime?
you have got wild animals loose in here
what chance do i have here?
he had all of the lowdown
i can see the footprints in the virtual sand
looking for a moment that will never happen
rick john sally a connection named paul
like a ghost to the door
for no more shall we part
for the miracle for the miracle to come
i said you need a friend
she said the art of longing is over and it is never coming back
i am listening to the sound of my own fear
do not want to have to lose you baby
i can talk anyhow and get along
and put him on the stand
he keeps it under his pillow
i missed the good part then i realized
do not put him down as arrogant
i have wished for so long how i wish for you today
does god bleed on your white halo?
i used to rule the world
yes and long live the state by whoever it is made
and i like the way you let yourself in when your mommy is not there
know my deliverance will come soon
the world is a cage for your impotent rage
if i only could i would be running up that hill
a change is waxed and wanes
pour it down yeah let it rain
but i can see it is not okay
and we can lock all the doors
i will even wear these old laurel leaves
so i let the moment last
and i know what is on your mind
if i can feel like you
is this just another day this god forgotten place?
all the journeys of this great adventure
white blossom falling from the cherry trees
and then the angels forget to pray for us
you refuse to talk but you think like mad
oh but i am always crashing in the same car
gun does the waltz around the room
and these days they linger on yeah yeah
i will give you a ring
my lovers never leave in love
i found it in a locket
forgive me if i seem to be too realistic
stood on the edge tied to the noose
through your crumbs and scattered shells
good times bad food come on come on
i am the one you are with
to a tropic isle of avalon
in the name of something new
if i could have her tonight
walked out on the porch and fired  am off
how many times do you hear it?
how i am feeling so revealing to me
well i might stretch it till wednesday
oh the sands my lovely creature
for my father and my brother it is too late
no escape no place to hide
with your winter clothes your broken sandal straps
and i am gonna be high as a kite by then
and you do not seem to miss me as much
all they ever want for you
but i might not have the sense
you say i always play the fool
i have been doing it for years
come here oh my star is fading
you have got to learn to hold your tongue
i have nothing much to offer
put that baby is spell on me ooh
they tell me i can blow
well i was only a kid gone without a backward glance
they traipsed mud all over the house
and a morbid lump of love in his flag
and the swan i tempted with a sense of shame
and if we all hide here
bittersweet i could taste in my mouth
i know you are always there
but i wish i could see him
picket lines wo not block our way
a rubberband bouncing back to life
i am going' back to my house
things were different then all is different now
you and i we reject these narrow attitudes
and in a way i am hoping
come on and raise this noise
whom he may never see again
and all my faith to see
i could not tell if you were blessed or cursed
sometimes i die it is true
throw it down by my side
hear me i am graphically yours
and they called me on that too
on the bank the scene was set
but i do not think we should ever suffer
and he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
like the fly on the wheel who says
climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
throw your precious gifts into the air
standin' at the crossroads baby the risin' sun goin' down
so that i can do it
there is too many of you crying
you found some iittle silver fish
and the ones who say there is not
parked under the stars winding stream
like a beggar out caught in the cold
that is the fucking time take a look at my life and you will see
oh baby tonight we sleep in separate ditches
a long way up in light-years
a wad of cash in my pants
he brings you out in style
of love and grief never normally seen
just wear that dress when you are die
bed down upon the drifting snow
i wish i could throw it on the fire
because i came here to bring them down
and my pajamas clung to me like a shroud
i was standing on a reef
light she was and like a fairy
life was not worth the balance
how to sleep how to sleep
you give me your you give me your joy
or is it just my way?
in the brightness of my day
watch the boats come in can do something to you
good old marianne who needs friends oh
in my hands you will fall
i am looking at the big sky
time stayes still only i can feel when the darkness will apear
so that others could go on
i think you are near me now
does not want to know her any more
trying to keep him at home
there is a man in the theatre with girlish eyes
and there is something missing seems like there is nobody listening
rolling over with the big sky!
sometimes i wake up and i am falling asleep
from a whisper through a megaphone
i will do all of these
i was hiding dear hiding all away
hide in your shell let the world go to hell
i get the words and then i get to thinkin'
this is what to do now that you are here
the good son has sat and often wept
long gone i recall good times
you are silver lining the clouds
seems we will never see the sun
and give the rest to me
a radar fix on the stars
but i feel so close to everything that we lost
that is is drawing us nearer
i am being held up by an invisible man
shed one tear it is just routine for now
he said listen to me child
and the wrong words make you listen
then i am sorry to let you down
for you might think i am crazy
where are the words that will make you see
you see it meant everything to me
do not take your love away from me
you have got to be you
ken is the leader of the glc
but the heavens they will reward you
and i found out in the end
i was lined up for glory but the tickets sold out in advance
'cause they want to be seen
i do not like the film
i will sing this song and
driving down the razor is edge 'tween the past and the future
for their curses to be broken
feeling life got a rocket ship that i wanna ride
and i would claw at your heart
across a young man is room
i know you have heard that story told
please do not go on me
i was with franklin roosevelt is side on the night before he died
there is a man of the people said 'keep hope alive'
even jesus would never forgive what you do
well now sorrow it comes a-stealing
a drama is my perfect bride
it is in the cards of destiny
climb up your mountain nineteen and countin'
like to see those guys again
and in vain to search for truth
spend your whole life living in the past
is it eric johnson or it will be the guy on the next album not wearing shoes
he said missy mouse are you within?
moving stranger does it really matter?
and brought it back to me
in the heat of the morning
and a vicious wind blew hard and fast
he is a rebel and a runner
i just ca not take it
ooh baby live your life for love
you and me on the bobbing knee
i ca not help thinking about me
but they know me better than that
sometimes it takes all your strength
a traditional version is also available
dom do aaah i will ring and see if your friends are home
oh i escaped it a life wasted
that is when we used to vote for him
hey! what is that you got on?
i ai not no fortunate one no
but your love is better than any other love i have known
off in the sunset she will ride
it is a heart of darkness
you are not with me x
some days we just do the best we can
and my eyes are not open
that is the new homelands and um that is all i can remember
that we have both been sharing
sorrow is child hears not the water
the breath of love is electricity
before his first stephe is off again
but we had our share of good times though along the way
myself do not talk to me
the elevator is broke so he slides down a rope
i wander round feet off the ground
on a tumble of the dice
not even the lady green sleeves
it is hard to take the heat
remember i could end all this
we have come together in the very same room
i was born with the gift of a golden voice
all you remember we will forget
i want to be your only sin
there is nothing here to run from
and if we could float away
she is wearing rags and feathers from salvation army counters
that can take you by surprise
and i do not believe in the existence of angels
we are walking down the driveway
oh yes she is gone away
it is not as if you are all alone
and darling that is when i
and kept the vision in her soul
ho ho ho hee hee hee
and stay all night with thee
i am not going to question it any other way
gale force shaking windows in the storm
i will race in to find you
the vow that breaks the world are spoke
from the painful cries of mothers to a terrifying scream
ah you do not even seem to know
if you want to use the car
the gospel according to marianne brent
i have got a feeling that you are going love what
comes a feeling of inner bliss
billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
i am not alone i have met a few
a different tree now lines the streets
i am the captain of my pain
when i get home i am buy him a little toy
as i wade out into the surf
the priests praise my name on this night
and that is faith enough for me
i have been searching for truth
i know it is my time
i just took a trip on my love for him
we are the unknowns we are all you need
it is a lot like life
it is easy to be kind
but he must he must he must
hand in hand they watch me cry
if the future is looking dark
we may never see the day
i have borrowed your time and i am sorry i called
with a drink in each hand
and by the time i get to albuquerque she will be working
you better pray your daddy he ai not far away
what will you find to say
and start heading for the door
wishing for a moment so that they could see
two dead marines standing in line
you gotta hang out another dancing day
yes i stay in the place i know
and one thin dime wont even shine your shoes
deep in my heart i lied
over the hill in the big green country
and when it does i hope that it will stay
drop in see around come back
they will trample on the grass
you have got to want it
from the blackest room i was torn
in a cry filled with footsteps and sand
i have never slept in satan is bed
you have got your leather boots on
you played the patriot you raised the flag
and the rivers shall open for the righteous someday
so let is not weep for their evil deeds
brother all a man can do
and let the night come in
piercing me right through the core
heaven knows if there is a ceiling
put your head on my chest
told the boss i was sick
he is been a long while in babylon
i know we are moving out of line
selling me what i do not need
but now she is gone even though i hold her tight
i know where long ago we agreed to keep it light
where lagan is light fell on the hour
and his voice was very cold
need to howl at the midwinter moon
but maybe it is the perfect day
faithful friends who are dear to us
and the future of our young one
you come back crazier but feel much better
in streams of light i clearly saw
i can taste more than feel
oh but i ca not just the thought of you
i just want to thank you
are we going to the same place? if so can i come?
i only want life to be
yeah i am stagger lee and you better get down on
winds are stirred by planets in rotation
in your body and your thought
the loons have flown for cover
when you slip into the sky
ballerina who cannot dance to anything
or if you want to strike me down in anger
well is it plague or is it cholera
i kissed a lot of people that day
every time i try to pull you close
oh now i am floating so high
now hounds of love are hunting
you know i would not lie to you
exploded on the water for everyone to see
once dissolved we are free to grow
and first i put my arms around him yes
where she stood and watched for him
when you are sitting all alone
in the clothes of a woman i would like to forgive
he is striking violence up in me
got a little dirty but that is all right
i have got someone seeing grace in me
lost let down people looking for me
and people call me traitor to my face
i used to play one mean guitar
i ca not and i ca not decide
we are both of us beneath our love we are both of us above
adolf builts a bonfire enrico plays with it
another mile of silence while i am
i feel the touch of her hand
and all of birds will sing to your
i ca not see the road
every eye gaping on john finn is wife
on a hilltop on a sky-rise
good place to hide oh my oh
no i have not been getting anywhere
so we will go no more a-roving
oh help me someone help me please
coming at her as i am from above
so ill go ill try to start moving
trying to keep a straight course
he could only love you it is said
could of learned your voice one last time
then climb into bed and turn to dust
why silks and plumes of yesterday is gowns
she would sigh like twig the wonder kid got got do aaah
but i am sure it must be laughing
people carry on regardless listening to their hands
we talk about it all night long
hey you pale and sickly child
he had to save mother earth
hero - not the handsome actor
seven lies mulitplied by seven multiplied by seven again
long ago i beard a tale
and the darkness at high noon
i do not want no more from you
you take my ghosts and laugh
and the money buys the clothes
there is still a light that shines on me
do not want to know the past i want to know the real deal
miss me? did you miss me?
but he will never scramble when the big waves start to roll
i did not even feel like trying with you
take this waltz it is been dying for years
and said i give you the one
and there is a little piece of you
the whole world will be different soon soon
your laughing eyes your crazy smile
what is left of me is gonna have to be free to survive
oh we can be heroes just for one day
'til you near him on the motorway
that you are knocking me dead
and i do not mind if it is dangerous
because you told me everything that i have done
i want to live with a cinnamon girl
i guess i am gonna find out any day
i wo not face the consequence
get is colder day by day i miss her
yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter
and i do love her so
a danger i am prepared to face
run for the shadows run for the shadows
we all want men we all want you
they would stick by you if they could
i want to hold your hand
yeah i lay down last night i was thinking
but for now love let is be real
we do not control where it leads us
written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
i am i am i am
was the most astonishing of all
there is a cold war coming
my fear of streets i cover
sometimes the wire must tense for the note
lift up your voice lift up your voice
i want i want to know the world!
sick of you sick of me
but when i will learn to be free
the space between wonder and doubt
spirits turned bitter by the poison of envy
janine janine you would like to know me well
free to browse among the holy cows
when she had contact with the conflict
thank your stars you are not that way
struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
no matter what shape your in
i have been waiting night and day
marks time for those who understand
they said the moon was his burning son
yeah but look at my face ai not this a smile?
exactly what they want you to
come on home cindy cindy come on home cindy cindy
was to make you the one
there is something that sounds like a song
and the fight til it is over fight til it is done
you gotta tell your story boy before it is time to go
with a mummified cat and a cone-like hat
but really ca not you find somebody else that you can ring and tell
i like to feel the wheel
and no more shall we part
as daylight broke i saw the earth
i ca not be sure i ca not be sure
and up walked a woman named carol
i got a coupe de ville
for the strength of another man
who have left their pride on the other side of
you and i we were captured
do not talk of heartaches oooh i remember them all
i have come to you to be saved
just stand on the edge and look in there
a diamond kite on a diamond flight
it is so hard to be a saint when you are just a boy out on the street
i will begoing out with telephone
fall dog is cruel and smart
and look up at the sky
i just do not like this thing at all
there is a place on high
a little slow now a little stout
and the spies came out of the water
now i feel my heart beating
i held her close i kissed her our last kiss
but you are feeling so good 'cause you know
and if she withered i would be to blame
when i am rolling on those big round wheels
locked in a giant house that is alarming
she is still a-waiting in her big brass bed
and all the pretty little horses
and then i looked up at the sun
for wanted acts of sin - they say
not until they let me see my solicitor
oh shadow love was quick and clean life is a well-thumbed machine
for the money and the flesh
and she floats upon the breeze
all your tears were at an end
and the wind it bit bitter
he is noble enough to know what is right
take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood
you keep coming up for air
'watch me choose my own direction'
so be careful what it is you are trying to do
wish that you will keep safe
i know i am in love
it is on your side now
dragging my soul to a beautiful land
if god has a heart he will find you
with all hope and dreams kept within
i come back crazier but feel much better
put you all inside my show
and i would be your slave
i want love so badly i want you most of all
love love love love you till tuesday
while you lie alone in that idea-free sleep of yours
there is too many tears to fall
then i wo not feel afraid
all the junkies pulling needles from their arms
you are the target that i am aiming at
you notice there is a highway
o you have seen that man before
as the days fly past will we lose our grasp
oh he chose a path heavy the fall quarter to four
johnny guitar watson staring at me
he is smashed his teeth out on the other
but never how to make the rules
i got  more minutes to go
it is the kind that leaves you alone
in red-eyed pain i am knocking on your door again
he lays down his queer plans
how to stand by her man
i am never gonna change my mind
i wanna touch you with my little finger
take you to the promised land
and your kiss was sweet as wine
you know we have told you before
or the color of your shirt
all the things that others want for me
that we will never know you
i got no place else to go
are you on the rise are you falling down?
over the bushland over the trees
when you wish upon a star
the people will all see its light
you were hoping for something less demanding
are you ready for the country because it is time to go?
and i know i wo not awaken it is a dream that can last
and your heart that is bruised but unbeaten
i can hear the buzzards hear the crows
to follow one is own dream
we are only at home when we are on the run
homegrown is all right with me
you would tell me about it wo not you?
you are bright you are strong you know your right from wrong
with all the shadows that it cast
in the teeth of a hurricane
as a hawk goes soaring by
to pick them up when they would fly
when you hate yourself my friend
be the rain be the rain
she has not the strength to love any single man for a length of time
to face a world of cold reality
and you will come back to me
your love was starin me right in the heart
i wish for you the stars babe
suddenly the night has grown colder
he will wrap you in his arms
the brothers come 'round the brothers come 'round
i feel a rush along my body like a bullet
so bleed for me i need hostility
we will get by i suppose
i will keep my mouth shut
one for each day since i fell apart
when there is no place left to go
hey i will change that scene one day
i see them glancing at the switch
said why do not you come in here?
i was with washington at valley ford shivering in the snow
and it is you i see but you do not see me
into the woods into the trees where you move and shift
carbed apart the madness that i stumbled from
drawing pictures nearer in the skies?
but i was not there anymore
every river that you tried to cross
so simplistic it kicks and screams
hey prince you need a shave
oh i think i landed where there are miracles at work
i am all ears oh the morning glory!
fly by night goodbye my dear
i could not cope or would hope eloped
i have got someone understanding me
to the beautiful and the wise
let me see your beauty broken down
out of the blue and into the black
i asked that girl which road she was taking
do not it make you smile?
thumbing a scrap book stuck up with clag
and put them in the new washing machine
stay with me stay with me
life wo not be the same without you
i am for tossin' in my sleep
if your hear can you let me know
i will never hold a woman this close
but love is the only engine of survival
and everything has a tale to wag yeah
we met wayne newton down on pebble beach and you acted like a fool
to the distant dream of the city
i see a policeman crying in the backseat of a dying ford
o baby we will be making love again
i will need you want you all of my life
of the bottom of the lake
[cf the lyrics to the song anthem on the cohen album the future]
the nagging of the mother of the wild
oh let the damn day break
well the sheriff says boy i wanna watch you die
say they were the best of times
she sat on her bed and thought of home
you murderers who have been so bitterly repaid
no penance serves to renew them
can they say that time will heal us?
where angels fear to tread you go rushing in
so i put my hands up to the sky
one day we are gonna get out
a ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee
and i smile and i sip my opium tea
her face is sans feature but she wears a dali brooch
all around this great big world
when you said my little girl
i hope it is your eyes he is seeing through
i will be like bruce jenner
hallo spaceboy you are sleepy now [second time hallo]
i turn to my computer like a friend
than tears that fall from eyes
cause they are gonna murder me
whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more
i wo not be your yes-sir man for anything
i do not know the people
take a husky to the ice
i took my love and i took it down
right up in the front row
she has little chance to make good
way up on the old dew line
while boss bellini waved his smoking pistol 'round
that i could not let my best friend see
we are looking in at other
and the moment almost slips away
i have got to fight the word
trust is just as rare as devotion
and i promise cross my heart
things you say well maybe they are true
i want a face that is fair this time
what has not gotsir namesone line
i do not want to be a soldier
but you should not be hurt
no longer sayin' mind your manners
and she is in there all night
a soldier with a broken arm fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac
tattooed your name on my arm
'cause i was born to run
and she locked her door so she could play
from the top of the world the top of the waves
tryin' to picture you and where you are
and he shows you where to hit
but you know that i still love you
do not you let it drag you down
i wake up to the sound of music
it do not mean a thing so
i sassed back to my teacher
he used to be so good to me now he smells so fucking bad
if you should fall into my arms
i need to get back home
false smiles i have rehearsed for days
neither how full nor empty is your glass
or given your own silver spoon
begin to live while you still can
and you need him now you are wild
as einstein said about his theory
but since he pinned you baby
is he truly out of mind?
to which she drew the curtains
my hands i had no idea what it might be but it was
and now it is come back to haunt me
you can throw me if you want to 'cause i am a bone and i go
last night i cried myself to sleep
news guy wept and told us earth was really dying
it belongs to all of us
corporate greed and chemicals are killin the land
but i ca not trace time
down down over her like a shroud
in the convent of st anna
they are just a bunch of assholes
out in the sky you fell beneath
i dressed her up in a cheap red cotton dress
and it is all downhill with a bullet
in my garden by the willow
oh and more as more gets
honey is child is taken over this place
so why hide it away from me?
look how they shine for you
think about all of the strange things circulating round
you know how complex women are
it should be better with you
driven day and night in circles
a lonely man i know myself to be
she needs someone that she can scream at
some people ca not stand no rain
yes you better knock knock knock on wood oh no baby
bets put aside you are evil let is crawl into your face
like a screw in the wall
guess i will waste away in here
lay their muzzles in your lap
i am a mess without my little china girl
we would meet between the trains we are waiting for
i have got to know if this is the real thing
cut the paper to the bone
the waiting drove me mad you are finally here and i am a mess
mmm yes one more step to the top of the city
my libido is split on me
you would better do something 'bout it
to see old rudy valentino buried
well they say that santa fe is less than ninety miles away
hey hey and that is my way
well you are pretty quick to say you love me
from central park to shanty town
slogan: what is on your mind?
you are part of the sum
give me back the berlin wall
i do drive a relentless course
when my heart still changes overnight
trying to shake the cancer off? stupid human beings
but a man never got a woman back
numbin' the runt of reputation they call rat fame
do not it make you smile? x
it smashed down hard on orpheus' head
they do it over there but we do not do it here
i feel like going back there but never for long
the sun is high and the field lies fallow
but i keep a poker face so well
why does it always rain on me?
i still remember how love burned away
that is a funeral in the mirror
my father was a sailor named captain kennedy
she is the apple in my eye
blood is thicker margarine than grease
and did you ever have a dream or two?
when i saw you standing there green eyes black hair
do not just stand there and shout it
here boy here boy! you have come home!
hero - the voice of reason
i did not even know there was a war
and he is lost his lucky charm
well i love that kewpie doll
i am sure that you will mean the world to me
o jours si pleins d'appas o days so full of charms
a little bird lit down on henry lee
are you driving a new car
rule britannia is out of bounds
they can read it in the papers
well i came home late one night
and i lean from my window sill in this old hotel i chose
attack the day like birds of prey
so they wo not get any of mine
but i am not goin' now
they do not scam do not fight
i kissed her lips as though i thirsted still
like a shipwrecked mariner adrift on an unknown sea
and i ai not gonna yell against no bells
this is my choice this is my voice
like we would savour a sip
and sometimes the winner takes nothing
the wind it blows the door closed
the wind blows fierce from the east
every time we talk about it i break out in a cold sweat
sister i will stand by you
keep the same appointments i kept
and the things he does are just too much
a little puny and just let me know if i talk too much
moving fast as light tv is on at night
i feel so sorry for you
it was you who covered up my face
looks like she is never coming back
the blood the soil the faith
til i hit the golden gate
i used the wrong method with the wrong technique
there is always memories for days these days
i got a rocket eyes on the prize
our thumping hearts hold the ravens in
'do not believe in ghost stories
through the days of shame that are coming through the nights of wild
then you would be ready for me
probably would have killed me if i had stayed there
saw there was one for every day
with an answer in his hand
drove the night toward my home
they are gonna throw back their heads and crow
mountains and valleys ca not you hear them sighing
they were waiting for me when i thought that i just ca not go on
there is a place called downtown
all the treasures the gold and glory
it is the american dream i am disbelieving
and to walk like christ in grace and love
home home where i wanted to go you are
it is an art to live with pain mix the light into grey
and the flies did buzz around
there comes a time when you just cannot deliver
and in  minutes i will be in hell
he offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
how little things can slip out of your hands
like a shadow on the sky
is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
come on home cindy cindy come on home to me
i know that something is coming
but you are wrong you might
got a sonic reducer sonic reducer
the night was hot and black
you set the clock right for the morning alarm
my broken hearts my fabulous dance
you gotta let me run away
but it do not look like no trouble there
muddy water is changing all i know
and i think you belong to me
but the morning you will wake
oh this is not for you yeah you
angels and demons inside of me
the others you would remember if i could spare some time
bumper to bumper in a giant cloud of fumes
turn me off or turn me round
i was looking at the big sky
to kiss and hit is it you i am feeling?
sister make the blind man see
when i was a young boy
like someone in japan who just lied
i said i would love to dance like you
to tear us apart took the fire from my belly and
i peer out at the passing shadows
i do not know why i am afraid
are you a teacher of the heart?
but you who come between them will be judged
and i ca not believe that time is
the world is full of questions
was waiting for that bell to ring
children swarm like thousands of bugs
sick at heart and lonely deep in dark despair
girls leaving this town 'cause they do not treat em right-a oh yeah
when you write your songs about us
no my secret garden is not so secret anymore!
he threw his arms around my neck
hey! you are somethin' else tonight so skin tight
the many ways i have tried
it is you that i hold on to
and the pain would all be gone
and we will steal a lover is song
you can move it up and down and when i am sleeping
oh hello mr soul i dropped by to pick up a reason
fingers down the throat of love
on a world of doubt and fear
when i could wear a sunset? mmh yes
led me down river of perfumed limbs
and the public are warned to stay off
do you really have to go?
the terrible tunnel of his world
all the cars sound like they are pulling in the drive
learned to trust and i learned to give
the well went down very deep
his burning eye will see me through
and i need to change you
a gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid
that is what she told me
you know how to work me
so much for all the prayers you have learned
red lights flashing through the window in the rain
i got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
we like to play you see
waiting for you to come home
music by geddy lee alex lifeson and neil peart
to each burn a candle for you
you do not know what he is after
what you have crawled here for
i am in pieces on the ground
give me a reason to stay
your little truth your vampire tooth
there is no more i can say
i am gonna fill your head with lead
and do the things we used to do
who was trying to put the wrong hand into the wrong glove
after having seen all that they saw
my small selflike a book amongst the many on a shelf
the sky is on fire the dead are heaped across the land
did you ever call my name by mistake?
you talked me into the game of chance
oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
there were times she was a woman
what is it like to crash?
and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again
was it only trees in the wind?
then we had a kid and we split apart
someone passed some bliss among the crowd
a big round bubble of sensuality
we lose sight of the way
i was taught to fight taught to win
time to plant seeds of reconstruction
what the fuck is this world
be cool or be cast out
you will never be the same
feel your hair come tumbling down
he is learning to catch the heat of the third world man
in the fall we let you go your way
i can see you on a hill
and the way that gravity pulls on you and i
and i will go down on my knees
i could swear i have been there once or twice before
she had a heart full of love and devotion
it is a smile on the edge of sadness
and touch you with their fingertips
i would not marry the pres-i-dent
look at all the little people
oh i am so tired and cold
fighting in the age old battle
'cause you know you are getting tired
if i ai not got you
her thighs are soft as marshmallows
they whisper still the injured stones
a driver on a busy freeway
with its very own breath of brandy and death
while the planets try to get organised
we let it in we give it out
as the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
but i think your pulse would start to rush
what would i do without you?
and so on and so on and
plays that song that is so elusive
and bend their heads all a-down
maids of bond street picture clothes eyes of stars
do we tire of all the little battles
i bet they are wrong i know they are
need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
three days and two nights away from my friends
put it in my pocket when it should have been framed
and when it was over it felt like a dream
that loosens the high silver nerves
if you do not burn out too fast
who put all the tar on the morning sand?
someone closing like the nightclub door
it is funny how even now you are laughing
sixty new cities an' what do i what do i
joanni joanni blows a kiss to god
that i never can say goodbye no no no no now
his last ditch lies down the road of trials
ca not bring the world to me
we can all pull on through
down in this dirty old jail
i gave to you now you give to me
i hardly believe finally the shades are raised hey
i was always looking left and right
maybe the streets alight maybe the trees are gone
what a fool i used to be
yeah my baby left me this morning
but it could not be you
and i ca not forget i ca not forget
a child with the ghost here
waiting for the telephone to ring
men will suffer men will fight even die for what is right
he always heard that crazy sound
it might last for an hour
just a room with a bad view of you
and it cut through the night
i have always been greedy that way
nick performed this for the italian film mojo along with gallon drunk and it
memories that flutter like bats out of hell
as the shoppers rush home with their treasures
you ca not make a thing cause the meter is dead
cause i see the sound in waves
and though i left quite quietly
you went and asked your doctor
you were young and it was summer
who put the palm over my blond?
question-time that says i brought dishonour
if you could see it then you would understand
i read the colors this mornin'
even if i have to sit and wait
now she is in the kitchen rattling those pots and pans
i knew you at your worst
she is not the car that she used to be
the feeling inside me says it is time i was gone
all this running around well it is getting me down
so put your chips down baby
i will stick it up your orifice!
just a memory passing like pages in a book
mission of a picture like the city and the air we breathe
ca not i spend it after i go?
ai not too hard to see
i will be over the water
we used to be so happy
every hand moving on john finns' wife
annihilation is one source of political free speech
oh i want to be a rubberband girl
and i have only had a few
for they marched up to bastille day la guillotine -- claimed
as they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
only you can do something about it
and then he billed you twice
maybe you will stumble upon it
judy i hear my baby calling
i look at you and see
that hides behind the cause and the effect
this ramblin' and rovin' has taken it is course
i will tell my loved one
you changed my mind in a minute
on thee our hopes we fix
there is always dancing in the big room
tell me why tell me why tell me
i do not trust my inner feelings
i reach out and i touch your hair
notch x notch winter x winter
i swear you would fall like a feather if i was cruel
and who will write love songs for you
i am waiting for this thing to end
and oh and i never meant to do you wrong
empty staresfrom each corner of a shared prison cell
only got this moment you and me
up on the angel is shoulders
you know i pity the fool i said i pity the fool
as the years went by we drifted apart
weave the fabric of their dreams
it blew to pieces my snug little world
we wo not see her any no more
kiss so softly the mouths of the ones you love
we got a job to do
hold me and make it the truth
hear what i have to say
it had nothing left to give
all the women tear their blouses off
wo not you celebrate our lives
i wonder does she think of me?
run from the house holding my head in my hands
i still like to sing a happy song
well i saw the man in question it was just the other night
but you could not get over the old one-two
cause you are a sky full of stars
made the wrong move every wrong night
i will tell a story no one would listen that long
the leaves outside the window waved all brown they were and falling
sparks ignite and spread new information
i wont cry no more tears
the one thing that this life has not denied us
i will be isolde or marion for you
watching him dash away swinging an old bouquet - dead roses
i ca not go on if that is the rule
orpheus strummed till his fingers bled
freedom the lesson we must learn
he taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule
so let is talk of love
then he fell face first and let out a sigh
the spear of the age in your side
gonna take it state by state
then die in the flames singing we shall overcome
you do not give a damn about that jobs you have got
ai not got no suitcase no suitcase
when you are tired of waiting you just
come on baby light my fire [repeat x]
i am going to give you my heart
all i need is this song of love
must be the one you love
we can run alone and free
let is have the good news instead
this house knows all i have done
they keep bringing out the dead now
but i am a seer i am a liar
whenever he works on a pavement
it is a flower touched by flame
if it is written on a sweater then i would better not you do it
one could almost call it an altar
a small boy and his infantry
and knocked him down a well
if he can take the fight
swear it on the moon and stars
i will get down on my knees
i wake up to the sound of music
well c amon somethin' and cut me loose
it is the darkest hour you are
like trying to make you feel
she entered the cut with her tongue
the girl i loved so well
plant that bell and let it ring
he looked once behind his shoulder
i am inside and i am screaming for some help
the shiv [?] is golden x
some things you have to believe
not to beg or to borrow
the monkey and the plywood violin
already told you once once or twice
there is no game to win so
does not mean i am hurt
i know a river where we can dream
attract a man and cut him down
at the end of the day
but it is all or none
to be sung of a summer night on the water
tryin' to sound like charlie manson
that when she came she would be coming just for meah yeah!
i was driving way too fast
it is my only weapon army of one
the man who can and do not look back
i am crushed in the crease
i will explain the nature of my pain
i wo not let you do it
when i came home late that night
'cause we are lovers and that is a fact
of idle minds and idle hands
of the man and are you of me
see the rider in the night
rich men is children running past
we will make them give us light'
you find them in the road
the blood it wo not wash off
we will take a slowcar to china
they are sick breath at my hind
but now here you are and here i am
another ship ready to sail--the rigging is tight
but he wo not need a bed
my song is love i know
there is no need to say goodbye to say goodbye
i am taking to the snow
i wonder can i goad myself into another take
i never can say goodbye no no no no now
who lost the will to fight
i know you are not poor
first comes love then comes pain let the games begin
sent on the wings of a dove
protect you from the silence for another day
rush - it is the bar the clubs the  wouldro
and all the senses rise against this
yeah! wo not let you in
'cause there is still a heart that is beating
while stepping through a heaven is eye
seems to me it is chemistry
like a plaque on the wall
let me hold your hand and be your loving man all night
like god i have fucked the world
why do not your try to forget him?
if you know what i mean
it is gonna be so good
she took back everything she said
just to hide in death awhile
like an angel pass out wishes
holding hands they found the broom-cupboard
than never to have known it
in the palm of your hand
cause to the universe i do not mean a thing
and though they left him nourished
remember when we used to go to church on sundays
i am not into that scene
can we pour some water on?
and so lying underneath those stormy skies
sometimes i feel like i am just a helpless child
and where am i to go?
is my own equation relevant somehow?
and say the mea culpa which you gradually forgot
she moves me with just one little look
she just caught me off guard
i would or would she leave me?
the stranger in the door is the same as before
and there was nothing left that you could feel
what i am hoping to find
and she moves something deep inside of me
i was not allowed to leave the room
for some reason i ca not explain
even though you will betray me
i would like to know what you have learned
or the glimpse of a woman is smile through a window in the rain
help me help me help me
i forgot to tell you how
she is gonna make them well aware
take it easy on my now
and i would die for the truth
i am the darkness that crawls into you
but others are puzzles puzzling me
tell me how do you feel?
i got scratches all over my arms
they were raining from the sky
now the workers have struck for fame
every pleasure we bow and close our eyes
it wo not be funny when they
do not be denied do not be denied
touch the fullness of her breast feel the love of her caress
you ai not got no car? he will get you one
she was born in a handbag
look at me darlin' it is sad sad sad
it is not there in the gin that makes you laugh long and loud
for i love you without measure
climb up up in the trees
she will tell you she loves you
no one wins but somehow they still play
that is right that is it
wellshe dealt my love a savage blow
and all your armour has turned to lace?
and walk straight down the middle of it
if you raise your hands to heaven
saying sorry that i missed you
i have been staring down the barrel of a gun
better pony up and bring both your barrel fulls
every time you can try but ca not turn on your rock song
i met a girl across the sea
i will miss your urchin smile your orphan tears
me and the boys we all go through
it is lots of fun to have you there
ca not turn around no ca not turn around no oh ooh
and you wo not make me jealous if i hear that they sweetened your night:
we are sheltered under the gun
where on your palm is my little line
i really felt as though i was melting
are you scared of what you do not know?
i will stand on your [incomprehensible]
forgiveness for the things i do
the full moon is looking for friends at high tide
i wanna live with a cinnamon girl
flow in and out like the tide
may the devil take all you men
nothing und looked up to see
no one is sorry you did it yourself
i tried to study it for just a while:
soon it will be christmas day
he is the pusher on the force
they soon forget about the sea
leather bang pounding on his back
you tell him to come in sit down
and i like the way you straighten my tie
to the sea and the sky
ontario i was born in ontario ontario ontario
dark red and big with blood
they call me on and on across the universe
still got a lot to learn
how in the world can we ever smile again
getting sick and tired sick and tired
they have been dealt a losing hand
drop the leash drop the leash
now you wish you would never left your home
there is a law there is an arm there is a hand
i know i said i would help you baby
the breaker is war on an unseen shore
you touch me like i touch myself
blind fish being used as musical scales
treats them now she is young
soft winds stir the sighing trees
from now on our troubles will be far away
all we ever look for a great big hug
see the world laugh at the farmers feeding hogs
do not care what the governments say
that a small town girl like you
'cause we will never say anything nice again will we?
yeah yeah oh yeah got to get
when all your minds were free
then kneeled his shadow on some steps
that you may reach a different verdict
and now the moment is all that it meant
when i was a child i had a fever
did not think i would see the demon in his heart
day all my day for night
as i am closing on death
they were bound for each other
i know that this will never be mine
i look down into a million houses
he said that in the end it is beauty
it is this that brings us together
i am a man whose dreams have all deserted
for the angry gods to see
wondering what in the world did i do
one thing i can tell you
you have everybody is friend age i suppose
i i i i i need a lover 'cause someone new
you can be replaced you know
come out of the garden baby
i will be a satellite of hate
make me do this make me do that make me do this make me do that
loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
everybody needs some reason or other
sometimes i am good then i am bad
the speaker turns on me spot her eyes
but i know darling that you do
that smile you down to you knees
and like weeds with big leaves
to let go of these feelings
what is the point of being free eh?
but he is always movin' much too fast
who will hover over you beneath the sun
ok if you do not want to quit let is try it one more time
is there anybody out there who
when you get what you want but not what you need
while we are feeding the flames
then bait ya hook let is take a walk
if that is the way you wanna play it
i get out of my dirty bed my dirty bed
i have been searching low and high
i will be so strong again and again
it gives me peace of mind
the god you love is gone
another habit like an unwanted friend
you can almost see the circuits blowing
i told you when i came i was a stranger
in the canyons of the great divide
for their sleep it did destroy
my arms turn in oh those clumsy things
and i am drifting drifting away
i heard it from my friends
and i kinda liked the streets of baltimore
little brown jug do not i love thee
your family is a football team
and my black and silver suit
that could count right up to ten
but he never even made it to his twenties
come to cover the muck up
i walk the streets not expecting morning sun
i fall to sleep in the summer rain
do not say you want me
let is go dancin' in the light
your guess is as good as mine
just jump inside and turn the key
go into the garden go under the ivy
and she floats upon the smoke
all that she can say is goodbye all things change i suppose
till you are tied up and your spell bound
i have seen the future brother
and there is nothing in mind
sing out yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah
take a litle walk to the edge of town
sorrow is child sits by the river
but that is the risk you are taking with me
the redwood is strong and a mighty tall tree
so now we live a life of give and take
i do not want to sleep
but i never go in now
sometimes it seems to call my name out loud
they were sunken in the cities deep
beneath the september moon and the heavens above
when everything that i have done
and they will never tell the story
just because weget aroundtalkin' 'bout my generation
that god never laughs at my jokes
i am an old film star
falls down and does not mend
you said just drink it up
now huck whistles and he kneels
watch me now watch me now
tie him up when he is fast asleep
all the fun with all this truth and consequence
there is a hole in the sky there is a whole with a big eyeball there is a
if you need us just call
i am sure you do not care but
that you were an island and i passed you by
in the spring protective arms surrounding you
this is not how i am
what they are able to do
our different faces to the glass
we are the ones who have to shine
i could disappear into the crowd
bread and water was my portion
he got the real killer groove
now you can drink it or you can nurse it
girls pretending to break down and cry
in mourning for their sister is loss
you ca not make love with money
uncle bob sat at the piano
no i wo not feel afraid
do not want my flame to get no higher
leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
well now here comes the padre to save my soul
even though she wakes you with a kiss
more than you seem to think
those heathens you hang with down by the sea
all they want to do is defrock you
i wave my little white flag at thee
going do da do do da do
why do not you try unwrapping
trouble that ca not be named
is this the right thing to do?
and i am what i am and what will be will be
i would been surrounded for hours
oh leaving here yeah yeah yeah leaving here
you will never see a sign on the front door
if you laughed at me i would laugh too
i swore i knew everything oh yeah
i ca not hold on the weight you bear
this child needs a helping hand
sister and i will be your brother
then i took the dust of a long sleepless night and i put it in your little
hope is like an endless river
we met before in the street
they will not take me for a buoy
oh no just let it be come on try
i feel the day is all uncertainty
you do not hear me [backwards]
and as the company crossed the bridge
ca not turn around no ca not turn around no ooh
i would spit on your heaven
call me up but remember i am no use to you at all
flaunt the fruits of noble birth
i heard what you said and i feel the same
oh the help is just around the corner
it could count right up to ten
with the weight of a thousand people
we have been far through this night long hour
and then i am up with the birds
what have you got buried inside?
when we are down on our knees
if you wanna be my friend
who calls me from the other side
and the officer without a word
can the child within my heart rise above
sending grief and joy down in supportable doses
and i stood at full salute
throw off those chains of reason
rock and roll will never die
here boy oh you are a good boy
wish you could pack my parachute mister
if only you hold on to your love
and there is no one in love
and the young ones singing softly
i am on fire for you
with it is brutal nesting habits
and buzz is not afraid of watts
when will she come to me
i am pulling on the pin
i hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate
telling me what i do not want to hear
i am gonna come on in
i met a man who lost his mind
where angels sing and spread their wings my love is on high
how could people get so unkind
i am feeling life got a rocket ship that i wanna ride
the urge to build these fine things
my voice sticks inside my throat
i have been told when i get older
finding the whole thing hard to swallow
only you are pure enough for truth
i am one of the devout
living in the summer of love
somebody give me the chance to say
not to god above but to you sayin'
judy i take my life from realms of light
and we walked back to the road unchained
the sidewalks are filled with love is lonely children
you play a cruel cool game
i thought you were a friend but i guess i i guess i hate you
well i am similar to you:
like a platter made of gold
it was you who built the temple
but i will see you in my dreams
hey i oh i am still alive well
i am coming out to find you
for a life of sin i have paid the cost
is it the way that you hold me
who can tell you you are just pissin' in the wind
when a child is born to live
they will bang a big old gong lay me low
flowered winds was where i lived
how long before i get in?
a warming trend - a gentle friend
i do not want to see that
more than words can ever tell
when i think about all i have seen
i feel you pumping just beyond my door
what is o k with the boss is o k with me
orpheus sat gloomy in his garden shed
so we lock up the killer instinct
but see how deep the bullet lies
its something i never thought you would be a part of??
i went to the crossroad mama i looked east and west
zane zane zane ah ah ah
i would start to believe if i were to bleed
i wonder if i care as much
oh i know what is right i got just one life
not tonight if you do not mind
i just wanna be part of the fire
i can save the universe in a grain of sand
you know what it is like
do not live for last year is capers
the cards on the table lie
such a rush to do nothing at all
i would faint from pure pleasure if you would come and sting me!
me down with my soapbox my pulpit
move out i do not like this feeling
and the saints will be there to escort you
i loved you for a long long time
styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer
down on my knees in suburbia
some are answered some are not
it is good for drifting drifting away
he has no use for words
i i wish you could swim
now only time can come between us
there is a bar where the boys have stopped talking
poor me now float me out to sea
slim tie showdown ca not stop
time itself is bought and sold
take the reigns and steer us towards the clear here
love is for fools and god knows i am still one
and it is here they got the spiritual thirst
but i really ca not be bothered
i have got to fight the man
can we hope to be forgiven?
but you never looked hard enough
but i am the clown who forgot how to laugh
i have figured out numbers and what there for
and come forth from the cloud of unknowing
the one down here is wearing thin
you make the rules you say what is fair
i believe in a better world for me and you
turn the pages of this old book
well do not breathe nor make a sound
please see for me if her hair hangs long
and held my soft white hand
could not you see that should have been me? i just walked on by
and i will dance with you in vienna
only she could save my soul
then take all the ice cream so we have got none
becoming a star will become your doom
a-rocking on my daddy is knee
she will catch me if she can
i lie awake with great ideas
barely fit to ring the bells
had left out those details of delight
two young children had changed his aims
wide awake and he shakes in a panic
there is nothing much to keep us alive but 'dance'
proud swagger out of the schoolyard
ah but no you cannot see
then ask me how i feel
and now the silent loony bin where
do not let the light shine on me
been around the world universe too
i know my hands will never be free
i had a dream that you had a different face
and if we do not hide here
tallys up his loneliness notch by notch
and how she was when she was beautiful
anger wear a crown of thorns
judy he is the only one who knows me
i want to breathe and i said
what kind of spirit is this?
you are behind the wheel tonight
she is only herself to blame
be safe mmh yes from mountain flowers?
life comes i can feel your heart through your neck
oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
is it you i am feeling?
yes in the heat and in the din
for you and me - sex is not a competition
a viper is voice would plead
it does not look the same up on the racks
he tossed the ape a mouse
all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad
on the floor where daylight dances
if they nig and they nag i will just put in the boot
come on and lay with me
but sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
it is just the dress rehearsal rag
i think this thing is getting kind of serious
dizzy in the head and i am feeling blue
i was thinking that maybe i would get a maid
between a man and a woman
but it can get so cold in here
i want to race down her street
i will never think twice if to them i never ever talk
i am the puzzle you are the missing piece
i will i will understand always always
and i have not felt so alive
and went to a room that was soon full of visitors
lots of love in the house
where we watch the bouncing sun
from the bricks of shame is built the hope
when our weary world was young
put a bullet in my brain and it makes all the papers
programmed for the guts and glands
i know it is hard to be you sometimes
when all on my mind was love love love love
still we go on diggin' ev'ry show
her features covered by her fallen gown
this i mean to whisper to my mind
we have been alone too long
the clutch of life and the fist of love
oh please do not go out on me do not go out on me now
like a home for old mothers
do you really need his hands for your passion?
when i get home i am gunna put things in order
and do not act so sincere
in an ether-filled room of meat-hooks
to the mouth of the man
i know that kind of man
c amon kind sir let is walk outside
by neurotic psychotic pig headed politicians
she will tell you she is true
or tie my feet down to the ground
where the money grows on trees
i do not know what you are feelin'
now i am saying how i am going to need a pill
i leave the - i leave the sins for another day
but the shadows talk to me
a plague i call a heartbeat
sorrow is child your arms enfold her
cold and alone like the bitter and dying
with are e m a merry cucumber
now i am your first big mistake
turn your back and walk away
i went walking with my brother
escape is never the safest place
time you made up your mind
is on your side it is on your side now
and we picked up the sex skin crawl
it was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
they came through the gate and across the lawn
what you live is your own story
the school boy told the woman on the street
lucy ca not dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
standing out here in the hot sun
what am i supposed to say?
and everyone you meet you ca not believe the things they say
the whole damn place goes crazy twice
nor dwell on what has passed away
yeah i know you tried and tried
tried to believe but you know it is no good
you do not need to tear out your heart
the drummer relaxes and waits between shows
damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
fire eating drag-queens dressed as society whores
i knew i was getting hotter
to be a woman and to be turned down
all to protect myself you see
stratospheric traces of our transitory flight
she is a dodo no no did not hear it from me
ben the two of us need look no more
that lay in store for me
'till the landslide brought me down
i stand outside this woman is work
never look back walk tall act fine
why did you make it so unreal?
we let him fill our needs
i lived alone but i was only
and i feel warm if you want me to
in the yellow haze of the sun
i even heard you laugh at me
i ca not go wrong 'til i get right
sometimes i feel like he is all right
is that such a stretch of the imagination?
well someone i know lost the whole damn world
to the powerful and the wise
she wants my honey not my money she is a funky-thigh collector
that bit there it was an accident
heart tell me make it alright
and by the honor had your own restored
elvis are you out there somewhere
the blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
black betty black betty bam-e-lam x
is lost and hurt and lonely too
buildings they rise to the skies
you know how happy i will be
oh not for you ah you
hoping that tomorrow we will all be freed
as though a thought stole you away
with the rest of the world
'cause i will never say anything nice again how can i?
far worse to be love is lover than the lover that love has scorned
i ca not live in this cage
i want to be your oneenough you wonyour oneyour hun
talk with you drink with you
evil as a murderer is dream
but do not make too many demands
in the stands the home crowd scatters
one morning i woke up alone
'cause i have built my life around you
and i am a pauper in a naked disguise
memory humming at the heart of a factory town
they do not cut the grade
to live in a house that is haunted
maybe these are secrets shared by those
you will be calling out my name
i know it is always there
and if i am reluctant you can pull me in
i can see the pain that you are frightened of
i pray you learn to trust
did you know that friends come in boxes?
as fearlessly as an honoured son
and leaning on your window sill
that we will never see your face
escape is never the safest path
i am d after a push and pull feeling
make a stand take my hand
but goddamn it carmichael you are dead now and i am talking to the wall
he is a restless young romantic
you all the dreams we shared and
there is a rustle of cloth
that we should swim in a covered up pool
face down in the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
it is going to be alright
the toy soldier and he raised his whip and said
i think it showed me heaven
with a party of penguins who do not know flow
beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where
with the trees all bended low
i was on the wrong page of the wrong book
it is hard to say just what i am losing
the sea so deep and blind
it is up in the morning and on the downs
under the surface trying to break through
all the things i wish for you
and the band is really happening
for still your face comes shining through
and it makes all the papers to
may all your troubles soon be gone
strike up the march there is no drum
in my garden wading through the pond
watching that clock till you return
if you are concerned well i do not care
was song after song after song
i see your face in mirrors shadowing mine
life is a drink and your love is
and all the ladies go moist and the judge has no choice
and carves his peg onto the finest mahagony!
although you may break a heart
and i know i do not need fame
you have the right to free speech
here am i still searching for my shadow in vain
to the far side of town
i woke up this morning with a frappucino in my hand
hey you are such a pretty boy you are so pretty
i can play a boy you might know
too late and too tethered away
no i do not love you
i feel the way you would
but it is gonna be no illusion
look back in anger driven by the night
in the sunshine of her life
i will even try to look ashamed
and them south side sisters sure look pretty
place my lips on your lips
between a man and a woman?
and light on your right knee
so i try to give back and i want to be free
these words you ca not forget
because we want to be just like you
from the skies you can almost hear them cry
but there is always a free way in his eye
and the way you seem to float
i only want to help you
do not try to fence me in
to fall upon the earth and spark another fire
the failed magician waves his wand
cast a shadow across onto me
it is just like you said
you know i did not even care
when she paws at the sky
it is instilled to want to live
you ran your bath and you began to sing
i could crawl around the floor
and catch my fall when i start to slide
i could not stop that you now know singing
oh honey i know it is not allowed
and i wo not need nothing else
and if the thames were not so filthy
i am dead and yet unborn
lord i paid a cost on the lost highway
cause i am not tied to the ground
big money leave a mighty wake
do not let it bring you down
there is not even a demon in heaven or hell
i am looking for someone to release me
you still have made a choice
wishing that maybe in a year or two
i ca not speak to you at all
he will think about paint and he will think about glue
into your life it will creep
please do not leave me here alone
i do not go out now that you are here
si tengo un saguaro no me has de culpar
and i know why i am flying
beneath a malign star by which he is kept
yeah i i am still alive yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
mind is not a celestial state with idle hymns of praise
calling you through flesh that burns
take my hand through this night without end
ca not remember anything at all
like a scar that wo not fade i will be yours
put an end to it all
they measure the room they know the score
for you and me - race is not a definition
when blue ties were for the biggy guys
i am not much nourished by modern love
the pub is crowded much too hot
did not think the voice that called me
she visits my grave when the night winds wail
i am guided by a signal in the heavens
the brass was a wonderin' what went wrong
love love love can break her fall
though i am younger than you
this is the worst day i have ever had
every inch between becomes light years now
cause you are not just anyone
she met a man along the way
it was parked out on the south east ridge
he is pissing he is living a day he will soon forget
the simple solution is to end it all
i can never thank you enough
some things you ca not forgive
tap tap tappin with his cane
i knew that i would have to suffer in vain
you ca not pray for a place
in the land of the broken hearted
it is just a one dollar secret
is there something you need from me?
in my new life i am travelin' light
and no one that you hurt could ever heal
i know i know i know
should i go forwards or backwards
and then the veins stand out like highways
you have made a wake of our honeymoon
once upon a time we are burning bright
where even richard nixon got soul
lie there lie there little henry lee
we wo not be there to be blamed
pin the donkeys on her tail
i am the spirit of greed a lord of theft
all we are accused of we will deny
a way to take us out of ourselves
she loves to go around anywhere
i was fiery but you put me out
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
she is out of sight to me so divine
you can forget about the heat
and i open my eyes to look around
and he calls to his father
i ca not get my satisfaction
last night my kisses were banked in black hair
i am the suitcase in your hallway
with the spreading of a low black cloud
and you have got a gift for anyone
i have waited far too long
but i sometimes have a second-sight
there is a light that you give me
home home where i wanted to go
can we help that our destinations
i am helpless for your smile
face up turn it up or turn that wild card down
and under these wings of steel the small town dies
oh baby please come back to me
but someday you are going to retreat
the stars are on our fingers
and the crowds have all gone home
this is andy warhole and it is take one take one
the pencil seller is dog spooked by the explosion
they are getting tired getting tired
and know tomorrow ca not be depended on
i kept it in a cage
this is more than a party
they slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
keeps us from the stark reality
my army of one is gonna fall for you yeah
i was there when you needed me most
it costs you more when you are to blame
all the voices of the sea
there is gold in them hills
get ready for love! get readyl
then i can find a reason to live
my hand on your head when you go
and the moon it is high
no one looks and no one feels
dance everybody down with us just dance
i wanna tell you that i love you
and i ai not too good
i wish that i could work it out
what do you need? [repeat: x]
i will keep my world from draggin' me down i wo not back down
mmmmm for magic loves the hungry
ooh life comes i can feel your heart through your neck
well i do that a lot
then say goodbye to alexandra lost
then i am dead and no one can help me
there is nothing i can do
yet they knew not what was wrong
and maybe lady luck ai not smiling
and there is just one word i still believe
i could be good for you
where the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave
just fitted out a girl who looked like a bird
well i dreamed i saw the knights in armor coming
you live your life as if it is real
you let your heart slip away
i am just a little bit sorry
if he came back and wanted you?
and finally i made myself a spade-girl
i move stealthily from tree to tree
before it is too late i must get away
take it in right yeah take it in right
but she is losing the light fast
but do not tell sunday is slave
get ready for love! praise him!
to our love send a dozen white lilies
if you stood in my shoes
and i could not take it any other way
and your chin is dragging on the ground dragging on the ground
as i sat sadly by her side
oh my lord oh my lord
across the waste of space and fields of air i glide alone at night
do you think that she would like to do anything
a hundred thousand miles of track
and my reception is loud and clear
under stand i am not falling down
i am growing scared of everything you could say
but there is a full moon risin'
inside the jet the briefcase snaps goodbye
i will never fall in love again
at the cradle of the river and the seas
i feel i want to be up on the roof
yeah i am a dude dad
i am giving it all in a moment or two
she turns me on do not get me wrong
i am no longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now
hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom
so far away and yet you feel so close
i want to live life always be true
so i have seen my future
it is time we stop hey what is that sound
never shot at a living thing
never need to wonder how or why
i cannot hear you are breaking up
they think they live in the age of light
you must keep it for the captain whose ship has not been built for the mother
why do not you come on back to the war let is all get nervous
i will say it again pain
i think i would like to go
i am the stain in your bed
and then she would weave it on a loom
and bit the recess lady is breast
you and i we are strangers by one chromosome
hip swayin' trouble makin' booty shakin' tripping passing jumping
where are you gonna go now?
peace of mind ca not be bought
and the meaning it gets left behind
because i have just one heart
we have come to hate the golden rule
oh ha ah ah ah ah ah ah
they are gonna launch me into the stars
and i am still so afraid
oh tangle of matter and ghost
coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
so i closed the book of longing
you ca not tell yourself not to care
and who shall i say is calling?
oh betty black betty bam-e-lam x
now it is too too late for
is there anything you want to know?
been around the world the wonders to view
and i can feel what you feel
'til i am only feet away
i got  more minutes to go
i do not know where we went wrong
the boy lies in the grass unmoving
it is a crash course for the ravers got got do aaah
how much time did you spend?
and the moon be still as bright
matthew is mother the change disturbs me
now i am sitting pretty down on the bank
oh brother i ca not believe it is true
they are lining up the prisoners
the hurt do not show but who knows time will tell
she can blame the world or prey till dawn
do you feel like a puzzle you ca not find your missing piece?
and i walk in the dark
save your money buy a tube
here i go  do not let me go
we generate a reason for living
and all the time the light is changing
whatever useless things these hands have done
it is easy enough if you do not laugh too loud
but it is gonna be really happening to ya
here i am with this old guitar
let all my guests come in
though i have done nothing wrong
in the middle of no where
all i want is to drink please fuckin' leave me alone
oh into the sunah into the sun
that when all is lost there will be you
another night of muscles and pain
that you should do it different
time is so short and i am sure
it is a red bike what a red surprise
where were you when i fell from grace
to be done with all this weighing up of truth
leave everyone to console their aching heart
it is a power with a hundred names
that rose out of the bitten soil
just to see the starry dome
of the word being made into flesh
still do not believe we are fading
oh we are tempting fate instead
ever since they came and burnt the old place down
just let me continue to blame you
i hear it laughing when something dies
miles of yellow tape silhouetted chalk lines
hey hey i am the stow-a-way
they drained her very soul drydry
just someone to keep my house clean
so before it is over before you run
it is a victory for the heart
i said young girls do not kiss me goodbye
you know this life is filled with many sweet companions
oh i need it oh oh feel it feel it my love
like a lion you ran goddess you rolled
but most of us just dream about
and spies came out of the water
i gather speed from you fucking with me
in a dusty black coat with
why did you have to choose our moment?
yes kind sir i sit and spin
it sure has lots of style
i have had enough of watching scenes
you will just suck in the boys
mmmm why do not you take it?
well i know they have always told you
forgot the love that had been implanted
you live some life you would never choose
and i have cried for all your troubles
i was hopin' it was a lie
and tells me who i will be if i stay
the helicopter scared the shit out of him
first thirty years and more i have loved her so
i know they will find me soon
there is nothing to stop you now
she is got a brand new guy
chilly down with the fire gang hey i am a wild child
but mom and poppa do not know
you make me laugh and then cry like the song of the clarinet
till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes
and wind up in the perp walk on tv
when you try your best but you do not succeed
and in the light just streams
she took him by his long yellow hair
into a life i have just been spoken
i ca not believe how love burns away
cologne she will wear silver and americard
thank g-d it is not that simple
deadens? my brain falling up through the years
down in the lime tree arbour
and undid the latch on the front door
way down in my heart i had an achin' pain
daddy went a ridin' in his old car
i saw you play the part
da da da dumb [repeat: x]
and the moon is climbin' high
i am lost in this calling
of this there is no doubt
and the coins in my pocket jingle-jangle
to your sweet and last amen
and we watch them every night
talking to yourself taking a drag
you are shining down for me
but it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
rocks are waiting boys rocks are waiting
check out what is under the hood
i wo not let you do it!
i will fight for the right to be right
islands in a much larger stream
scrawl dissolved cigar box on the floor
it is all in your mind
i know i walk every midnight to dawn
you saw her bathing on the roof
and when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
i will give you dreams and i will tell you things you will like to hear
i will ring you on the telephone silently
one two three four five against one
it is the power and the glory
this gene pool dark and deep
and now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite
want to share it with you
you are living like a satellite
like lovers and heroes lonely as the eagle is cry
soul birds of a feather flock together
be the river as it rolls along
oh no there are no no grapes upon your vine
while their invaders dream of lands they have left behind
i promise you i will learn from all my mistakes
to lie between your matchless thighs
is there anything that i can do?
but now you shall play in the market square
little white clouds like gambolling lambs
in the house where nobody laughs
which way the river gonna flow
they are making sorta crazy sounds
i wish that i could be there
a ticking box in the hand of the innocent
my mother and her little brown jug
i was not praying for magic
lover there will be another one
the best of the last the cleanest star they ever had
to live a love you gotta be part of
and the men stood straight and strong
and the charger in the garage
been innocent but a sinner in me
driven to the margin of error
there is a sailor who sleeps
once upon a time i could love myself
the die is done the die is shook the die is duly cast
or none of it is true
i hope i make it on my own
we will be birds flying free
the boys they are dancing they just ca not stop
ca not we raise our eyes
no purse of token fortune stands in our way
well there is two kinds of love
in the silence between whisper and shout
the music is loud and much too fast
found new life in jesus christ
it is beyond my wildest expectation
this is a fact this is a stone cold truth
what i am trying to say
yes i will be breaking these rocks
and all go stumbling through that house
got caught with the boss is wife
but even he do not know me well
it is the woman in you that makes you want to play this game
are you woman enough to be my man? bandaged hand in hand
under the gaze of the angels
i am gonna dance the dream
lost in the rags of remorse
on the seventh hour an angel came
well you know the story of the viper
if you could just move yours
elsewhere is your feast of love
full of beer full of cries
because i came here so violent
oh you are gonna get it right some time
'cause when i make a promise
see it happen to a couple of friends
if you are the dealer i am out of the game
do you laugh out loud at me?
on a bare and weathered shore
i had to count on you
she makes me feel so ill at ease
but i will try my best
they go knock knock! knock knock!
until they moved on the show
change your mind change your mind
our captain takes time to crush
i miss the earth so much i miss my wife
alive in the streets of the city
and sing for us so that we may remember
are you getting out or are you dropping bombs?
and they say you can see your future
how long can i carry this monkey around
she kissed the blue bird is honey tongue
no mistaking the faking i care
when you climb to the top of the mountain
i could feel his mind decaying
oh-the glass spider had blue eyes almost like-a human is
they are gathering round with all my friends
and when i get the paper i read it through and through
my pride is made to say forgive
there was a picture of you
i would appreciate the things that you
and where will she go and what shall she do
people are people so why should it be
do not feel like satan but i am to them
you never will you never did
he was three miles down the road
we are in formation saying  isafe safe safe'
in a castle dark or a fortress strong
and the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
look around and see the friends
sitting and singin' the higgs boson blues
do not try to slow me down
it could count right up to eleven
you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
it was where everyone could see
listen to me - do not listen to me
are we the last ones left alive?
if you are looking for me
oh you who are flung out alike from heaven and from hades
of the husband and the wife
it is method on the edge of madness
i think i am going bald!
did shine both day and night
there for you my amber jean
in a house draped in net
ah let it be yeah let it be
and i like the way you are winking your eye
do not let the mystery go now
and then consented to be wrecked
i am by your side i am by your side oh
from central park to shanty town
you and i we are pressed into these solitudes
and makes you up real fine
i was dying to get back home
will i walk the long road? we all walk the long road
on the dry and dusty road
press control and d to bookmark do not look down do not look down
now they are taking pills and shots
it was back in ' when times were hard
dance me through the panic till i am gathered safely in
and i think it is gonna be a long long time
and they sworn about the groaning
yes she does yes she does
hear the snow crunch see the kids hunch
hello wo not you let me come in?
oh and you are standing right behind me
what good is a photograph of you
i stand watching the steamliners roll by
and boy i really felt blue
i keep hearing that you are doing best
i stop and i stare too much
that my life would come to this
could you turn the lights up?
i could go back to crying
bugs in the way i feel about you
we do not need to tear out our hearts
and everything is gonna be all right
i chase you up and down the stairs
can we know how we feel?
just me this means nothin' no more
i will never see a face like yours in years of men to come
but you you and me love
why does it always rain on?
steal my heart and hold my tongue
and all the soldiers curse the day they joined the army
and she whispered then let laughter flee
your house and even your eyes are new
princes di is wearing a new dress
and the red-breasted robin beats his wings
and see how his face glows
and ah they wo not let me see anybody
chorus: four strong winds that blow lonely
in a driving rain of redemption
you play games you play safe
face up there is still time to turn the game around
band the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle
that is why they call it the hot spot
i will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
she was stricken with a seizure
but i am still getting educated but i have got to write it down
i just want someone to be there for me
to get in do it and get out
but there is a little guy on my shoulder
over half an hour i stayed awake
do not worry i wo not hurt you
you used to be so young
ca se voit ca se voit ce se voit
yeah yeah i have got a feeling yeah
they were leafing through your hair
field commander cohen he was our most important spy
know a manhis face seemed pulled and tense
i took her from rags right through to stitches pray for me now
you are holding in your hands
it took hours and hours to scrub it out
i will never come through this alone
i got a feeling a feeling deep inside oh yeah yeah oh yeah
they say you sparkle like a different girl
how long do you think she can stick it out?
yes he was alright the song went on forever
come on now all i see
dead or alive bring me the disco king
when they could not let it show
wo not you let me know?
let your fingers do the walking
all you ever have to hope for two
i am sympathetic as well do not go on me now
just tell me about it wo not you
come to see her in the river
sometimes i feel like a piece of paper
if you do not stay tonight
all the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
through the ice and through the snow
i will have it all my way
to lead us closer to the heart
august th th   nicholas august wednesday th sunday th
we all figure that our homes are set above
then praise him a little bit more
but there is only me at home
tried to make you feel big
said the fool who signed the paper
we can beat them forever and ever
some of us play like god
all this time we are burning like bonfires in the dark
my life that might have been
and the moon is swimming naked
the fears of gun are the fears of everyone
once is always so do not call me
seek reward in the ever after ever after ever after
blowin' another one over the side
she said i will be with you
restless wind inside a letter box
i put on my coat of trumpets
you can only whisper his name
you know the one with stars
you started rollin' down that lost highway
like two blankets layin' on a bed
long to slam the front door
oo-oo-ooh call them the diamond dogs
need you in the evening when supper time is through
the smell of her the touch and the taste of her
now we are headed for the big divorce
we have been around we fall we fly
the one that i believe in is a wish in a song
there is something in the sky
but saw the trapdoor in the sun
maybe i am in the gap between the two trapezes
even my old man looks good
would my fears now by winning?
you know time is long and life is short
let is roll baby roll x
and when at last the demon came
he ca not do what you do
the ones we wish would listen
i am shying from the light
i ca not read shit i ca not read shit no no
i am grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses
stealing for that one good rush
and all the words we said before
that mickey mouse has grown up a cow
feeling dejected feeling like a child might feel
everybody knows the fight was fixed
i fear i am walking in the veil of darkness
and though her mood is fine today
thinkin' about what a friend had said
dragging its tail in the sea
to feel what is right and wrong
there is a room in a long form
i had to get out of there dear hiding all away
perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one
till morning when it is time for us to go
i do not think you really really know what it is like
you cry a little in the dark
i bring love to give you solace
a flock of birds hovering above
i am waiting for the boys to come
though spies hide out in every corner
i was handsome i was strong
bless the sun the rain no more
in games without frontiers-war without tears
this is what i ask you for nothing more
they are gonna wave their arms about
out of the realm of the orchestra
i think i want to change my oxygen
one is wrong and one is right
oh my god it is a jungle in here
i know it must have hurt you
sometimes he hid in his radio
but they do not do they?
cold wind ripping down the allay at dawn
and the hearts of men despaired
he is not concerned with yesterday
sleeping it off at a station
her hands are small and fluttered up
and her daddy has told her to go
why a billion other choices are making their demands
you could ever wish to see
my body is broken fast please lift me up
beneath his hat the strangeness lies
when you are by my side
oh and a brother back to back back
ca not turn around no ca not turn around ooh
yeah this little girl is nearly half of me little liza
and oh oh yes i would
but you you have promise in your lovin' eye god it is dark now
how is this life that sweet when i am crying in my car
did i say that i want you?
i did not see the time
place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
it is a big bike what a big surprise
you will be making love to me
but there are some things love wo not allow
the cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone
i came here with a load
do not cry my sweet do not break my heart
i was not walking with angels
i have nothing more to lose
this desire to possess her is a wound
tonight tonight i just ca not rest
swept out through the cracks beneath the door
i have got to fight for you
we are older now the light is dim
he tells me that he is beautiful
you just say you are out there waiting
the mean governess of the huge pink maps
oh well i am growing tired of this place
i wonder does she call my name?
take away the stone and the timber
get back on it get back on it
but your signal i just missed
i will cut my picture on your heart
you know how that rabbit feels
if i have been taught from the beginning
planets are moving at the speed of light
and i show my darker side
i thought i saw oceans burning thought i saw oceans burning
i do not want nothin' else
raise a tent of shelter now though every thread is torn
and show you the way to go
we can weigh all the tears in one hand
you will see him in your head
hey big oil what did you say?
not by begging on his knees
but eating of the captain is biscuit
dream of a time without war
when slumber slips between your lips
watching you peel heaven knows prison ca not hold all this greedy intention
it is a hot certain kind
evening flower all alone puzzling capeche
let it be yeah let it be
they are gonna sink me in the snow
summer is here and the time is right
why the fixtures turn to serpants snakes?
she is the sweetest love i could find
love is born with lightning bolts
pushing the hair from my eyes
and the break of day had nothing to reveal
come on stand clap your hands dance dance
on a beach reach for java
each tear that flows down your face
o lord tell me what i done
gods in the heavens ca not get it right
i come from a genius i am my father is son
but you would have to play the fool
you could feel the bitch outside the door
spat it out in front of me
others are running the smaller ones crawl
we need something we need to play
yeah the spotlight shines upon you
bad hep with the fire gang
i said how do you live as a fugitive
oh never was for you fuck you
the judge sent me to prison
do not play if you ca not lose
give up your vow give up your vow
put your faith in big hands
there were peasants singin' and drummers drumming
we can only go the way the wind blows
yeah i have got a feeling yeah whew ooh oh yeah
you get all wired up inside
i would see people in the street below who do not know where they are going
just this long wait for pain
i can feel the storm come
i have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels
do not try to tell me
someone who will stick with you to the end
when she could not hold she folded
but you never even see me
i do not give a fuck
when that heat hit the blankets
it is you my love you who are the stranger
not for just a second or a minute or an hour
just keep smilin' move onward ev'ry day
do you want to hear about the deal that i am making?
and we are reaching the end
we have the answer to all your fears
that is all right by me
on the price of being free
stare at the anti-terrorsts standing higher
and in my hour of darkness
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
big birds flying across the sky
did not i just buy that dress for you?
if laughter is a straw for a drowning man
food and wine they had aplenty
putting out the fire with gasoline
life is a drink and loves a drug
and more or less i spoke from my heart
'cause i ca not help thinking
but i would just like to play for the fun we had
by the winds of change and the weeds of sex
who did what? what went down?
why have you put me on the spot?
i tried to explain oh somehow
i said to hank williams: how lonely does it get?
who later are packed in a cast iron trunk
for an angel to forgive my sins
but they have taken out the stars
let is go let is go
do you need to hold a leash to be a lady?
we left our luggage back in the room and almost missed the bus
you are only real with your make-up on
but she will go walking out that door
up above candles on air flicker
you will see it coming toward you real slowly for a shake
you can strike up the march
je ne la verrai plus i will see it no more
look i am here with the ladder
and the rain and the pain and the sorrow
and they died along the way
cover up with all of your pretenses
half of us divided like a torn-up photograph half of us are
throw caution to the reckless wind
you know you should have taken all your dolls to bed
from the chains that bind me
this club is called the webb it is this month is pick
did not want me around any more
with a lump of wood a piece of wire
words were not spoken for you
upon the scattered stars set sail
it is too early to be leaving here somehow
like you vanish like tears in the rain
and she hired with a captain
i have not figured out why
quickened with passion and with pain
with my ego in my gut
we have been far through this night long hours
you wo not really be alone
for the phone calls and smiles
driven to the edge of control
that your gone all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum
to be done with all this measuring of truth
i said what do i know
first thing she learns is she is a citizen
by subtleties that we are not aware of
got a gun fact i got two
in the cross on the hill jesus
just to get a better understanding
i hear in the rate of her heart
but i know that this will never be mine
they were talking in the strawberry swing
you crush the lily in my soul
i am so busy trying to break this wall
just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss
i have heard a rumor from ground control
oh we can beat them forever and ever
down where the sea and city meet
if you gonna go go now
well i did not go to work
and now the night is still
but i knew if my nurse had been here
said you sailed a big ship
my blouse wrapping itself in your trousers
and the spade-girl buried him underneath the house
the warriors felt my silent cry
i will be fine i am only screaming in my head
i wo not forget the way things are
each of us a world apart
get real get real get real
wo not you say for me
no i wo not back down
you can call it fade out
can i handle the seasons of my life
yes i feel nervous and i cannot relax
rolling the ball rolling rolling the ball rolling rolling the ball to me
would i ever let you let you down no way
i do not want to take what you can give
when i left they were sleeping i hope you run into them soon
for this ugly hump at which you stare
rolling the ball rolling rolling the ballrolling rolling the ball to me
honey i am flexible oh yeah
tell me lies tell me lies tell me
that girl made a mess of you
how good it is to live
a little visit a reminding me of his presence
all i know is that you are not with me
she keeps saying things like this
cried so much his face was wet then i knew he was not lying
a couple of drinks on the house an' he said
what must i do to prepare
black betty had a baby bam-e-lam x
counts his money every morning the only thing that keeps him horny
with the sea breeze whistling all alone
he knows constant change is here today
shines around me like a million suns
ohoh here is the constellation of the heart
but i will only fade away
there are those coupons you can send
died at the age of seventy-four
yeah wow i got a feeling yeah whoa
but i still could not close my eyes
disciples of the snow dog sound the knell
no time to wallow in the mire
i would not trade tomorrow for today
i am gonna shake this day
then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon
lord do not they help themselves?
you know it is harder to take it from anyone
i could escape this feeling with my china girl
hey baby it is a quarter to eight
how often people change no two remain the same
then let the other selves be wrong yeah let them manifest and come
i stumble into town just like a sacred cow
when she came that she would come for me
steer your way past the palaces that rise above the rot
joan of arc walks into my mirror
see the arrow that they shot trying
from a place they will never know
and they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song
i have known fear many times but nothing like this
garbage in honey is sack again
i am looking for a vehicle i am looking for a ride
i have a reason to give
like to take a cement fix
if you want to stay in the race
there is nothing pure enough to be a cure for love
i was hiding in a dead soul
that is the shape i am in
and if you ever have to go to school
je le borde dans le lit
he is come to turn you in
to make some sense of our difference
i go shuffling out of life
behind her eyes there is curtains
is it true you betrayed us? the answer is yes
except for the farmer is market
i was blind and i saw the light
got some kicks want to take a ride?
i do not know what you are
but i do not pretend faith never works
and the waves on the seas
i know someday you will have a beautiful life
daddy went ridin' in his old car
i am so glad glad glad glad glad i know what is on your mind
and i am crazy for love but i am not coming on
as the mist leaves no scar
i will never leave it dear
in a long black trench coat
yeah shakespeare said it all then he said no more
but our lives are valuable too
got this burnin' desire coming straight from my heart
mist in the streets of westminster
she do not need you this i know
i never know where you are gonna be next but i know that you will surprise me
do not take your love away from me
ca not stay long here comes the reason why
we are under fifteen feet of pure white snow
i changed my clothed to black
you can travel anywhere with anyone you care
so who knows all the sights
and you want it all to end
you your lungs and your wrists
i see you lying down with me i see you waking up
pretty young thing but no-one cares
i came to late to cause a stir
for their hearts were so unclear
what is all this 'original' con?
we met when we were almost young
i am just what i am
and please do not make me go there though there be a god or not
neither good nor bad just a kid like you
i can think of nothing better
there is a sun shining in the sky
would she walk with me a while
well twice i am sure you knew
like malice through the looking glass
would give it tenderly into his hand
and i know and i know and i know
hey babe can i count on you
ca not seem to loosen my grip
i stood there like a mystic
captured underground my big noise transmission
with their red and golden paints
it must have hurt your pride
c amon angel c amon c amon darling
and you climb the halls of fame
the skid of her wheels she feels
i just want to be part of the light
let the wind blow through your hair be nice to the big blue sea
betrayed like the rock of gibraltar
when you walk out through your door i will wave my flag and shout
and they called me the sparkle
oh-oh-oh-ohh oh-oh-oh-ohh just for one day
and i have got the need
did you know that i do not run
but i would like to stay down here
'we will go dancin' and eatin' it up
oh i will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
'what a lot of dust we are raising'
they do not even just pretend
and it makes me feel so sad
it is just a dress rehearsal rag
you have been around so long you must be strong
you take me to you lead me through oblivion
today i missed a special friend
nail me to my car tell you who you are
and in she came did john finn is wife
little light will guide them to me
everybody had a wet dream making temple was a good time
it is easy to see far away
it does not matter what you wear
i was not so sure she wanted him to stay
i have finished with this journey
still i call it magic such a precious truth
i took shelter from a shower
life comes i can feel your heart
i hear the beat of an anxious heart
could you climb higher and higher?
they stink of the west stink of sweat
i was waiting by the screen
now it seems i get by
oh god! frankie! is that really you!
catch the mist catch the myth
and she is not here with me right now
the foundation of my home --
there is a warnin' sign in the road ahead
your country is new your friends are new
i grow weary of the battle
wo not need no strong man
and my head was in a glass
there is too much confusion i ca not get no relief
and you never let yourself go again with me
i kneel down by your side
never thought you would habit x
ooh there is thunder in our hearts
you can take me you can make me smile
yes many loved before us i know that we are not new
do not tell me you are not that kind
until i pul you to pieces
the way is long and the shrine is far
has left a pool of tears
and the guns shot above our heads over our heads
i do not want nothin' else
i do not know what i am doing outside
they will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem
when the sun do not shine it do not shine at allyeah
did he dream was it she
and out on the corner it is half past five
i would rather be flying i would rather be flying
once you start watching you keep on watching
and the paint is peeling off of my walls
lovers pause to find an open store
can grandma come and see me?
and i should never have tried
we have lit our town so there is no
you ca not conceive of the pleasure in my smile
do not let'em steal your heart away
or brought to bear in hell
i rise up with the dew
he lost his wooden schooner to the germans on the sea
if i if i would only waited
look inside do you dream of a time that is better?
if i could stand to see her cryin'
but the key is a question of control
and sometimes when the night is slow
he is dissolving dissolving before me and dawn will come soon
i took you on a trip to malta
rye whiskey rye whiskey rye whiskey i cry
i could not possibly permit you in
you wo not hear me leaving
where i have to go begging in beauty is disguise
look at you you are a pageant
they all went sailing 'cross the lake
is leaving sacrificed most of our lives
they like to advertise how clean and green they are
you mix the stars with your arms
then let me start again i cried
yeah i got a girl who loves me true little liza
my girl calls my name hi dave
there ai not no way to stop it though
and we turn them inside out
i gaze at their feverish pictures
[too bad] i am just counting sheep
sundays fridays tuesdays thursday the same
come on give us a kiss
do not stay in a sad place
saying that i am the man
that we need the leader of the glc?
i have gotta be up on the roof
a foggy day in a london town
from nothing real i just ca not deal with this
if you could read my mind love
there is no today for us
now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view
like a pawn on the eternal board
going where i want instead of where i should
and i will wipe your tears away
tore out a page'n istufft it inside my shirt
and my honor is at stake
i have got a feeling that
he is very understanding and he is so
and a voice guides you home
and go to town and when we get there we will stop our only dime
all the days of your life
[a grief came riding on the wind
whee-hee i tried to flag a ride
but it really does not suit my style
then she platted all the willow vines
when you stand next to me babe it is all right
i feel my time my time has come
you will go backwards but then
uncle rat laughed and shook his fat sides
well the well went down to hell
this girl her world is made of flashlights and films
i am yours till the end
reaching out for that hand to hold
all your praises they shall ring
save the planet for another day
but ah can hear the most melancholy sound
i can go anywhere for something new
there is a kinder gentler police man is hand
feel how say no more but stay yeah
this garden that i built for you
hear the mighty engines roar see the silver bird on high
but all the lines are cut
and televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
and i wont quit till i am a star
i have never seen your appetite quite this occupied
and it is naggin at me like a shrew
i see the love turn into feelings
do we weather out the stormy evenings
and you wo not have to move
waiting for then when the lifespray cools
shadows on your saxophone a surly lady in tremor
the streets were lined for the wedding parade
i do not give a damn
and god rides high up in the ordinary sky
said come on out with your hands up
magic is afoot god is alive
morning came and then came noon
you can lay your burden down here
i ca not meet you face-to-face
this world is no longer good enough that makes me wanna cry
and i am waiting for you to come home to me
or else we just do not see the other
that is good for me and it is good for me
i feel it fall from me
whilst flying through an azure cloud
loco lomo loco lomo l'wow wow wow
part of a system i am
i had to laugh not to cry not to cry
i believe in the power of good
there is only the sound of the rain
cause i can play this here guitar
gotta take her gotta take her
sure 'nuff he has the answer
he lies broken by your shame
some kind of trouble on the sensory screen
moving oh so swiftly with such disarm
and tell that you are eighty but brother you wo not care
sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake
what do you expect of me
i am an angel of god
but there is no place that i belong
have yourself a merry little christmas
i have begun to long for you
whirlwind life of faith and betrayal
oh do not you love me
fill up his home with priceless junk?
because my country is all i know
in silent bars in silent rooms in silent cars
mo tengoku no giyu no kaidan wa nai
you are the only one i want [repeat: x]
and it is just like you said
the force goes into the flow
but he ledeth me like a lamb to the lips
say goodbye to the thrills of life
i left home at a tender young age
that is a hard one to remember
what made me feel so bad?
bloody your hands on a cactus tree
load up and then we all
for you have touched her perfect body with your mind
come on yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah
out single file nine in a row swear if you must
they touched both my eyes and i touched the dew on their hem
and the cross i am bearing home
that i will understand it all
yeah we are drinking and we are dancing
finally i have found that i belong
where is the wave that will carry me
their spirits were divided into blinded hemispheres
you will never see a man this naked
there is still a light that shines on me
for the million people who got not one voice
climbed towers and trees and walls
my pistol going crazy in my hand
now you are standing there tongue tied
walkin on the bridge on day
it is a plague that resists our science
but now i have powers o'er a woman is body yes
once upon a time on the same side
features distorted in the flickering light
beautiful bluebird see how she flies
such a long way from home just me and
and who taps me on the shoulder?
reflected in another source of light
always home but so far away
i will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right
but i am not gonna call you again
chase the light around the world
then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer
my love on the wing at night she rides
a nicotine wish and a columbus decanter
baby it is a violent world
hoverin' just above your bed x
that grave you have dug between
there is a blaze of light
she says where can my loverman be?
my secret garden not being secret anymore!
be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
bad news is come to town
there is no way to tell to be sure
and yes i said yes i will yes
it is you i am hoping to see
war is all around us my mind says prepare  fight
i am crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
i said i played this song
with the living let what is living love
hit her foot against a splinter
the tears that i have shed by day
lyrics: cohen recorded by buffy sainte-marie
i am a dream i die by light of day
she is standing right in front of me
wo not you take me where the streetlights glow
in the twisted canyons of the great divide
and a friend that used to be
going to stand on that bridge
but you do not know me babe
but no you let me go
all the bills go by and
and it ai not exactly prison
what about you did i ever take a thing from you?
oh that i was where i would be
still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
wish upon wish upon day upon day i believe oh lord
his body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool
come back and give me a chance to explain
one day i am gonna get that faculty together
hope i am wrong but i know
and sometimes i am not sure
aye the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave
we ca not live in the past
'what you on man to get those eyes'
did not know the right thing
see how the child reaches out instinctively
if you are the dealer let me out of the game
all my life i saw evil eyes in old dark sockets
outa her night-mare and back into mine
and my emotional stability is leaving me
i had to get away dear i was hidden all away
when can we do this again
it is too late for general custer
but we are all without shame
i am gonna kill that woman god knows
it was not me who made you go though
i knew that you would love me as long as you wanted
this useless old fucker with his twinkling cunt
it is just the dawning of our love
come on and sing it out to me me
there is a brand new dance but i do not know its name
still getting over all the suffering
i am not afraid to die
oh hush my friend and sleep
far to many people looking for their money
i made it to the forward deck
could have had a castle and worn a ring
and we saw them as they fell
oh get me on my feet wo-ooh!
fills it up with his past gets carried away
i am thankful for my children
to work in the secrecy of the desert sand
well it takes two to tango
had i not found this love with you
why did i ever go marry her?
yeah yeah tonight i am gonna
nothing is really making any sense at all let is talk
you almost get used to such things you know
the man they call my enemy i have seen his eyes
shaft of a light a warm breath and a scream ah yeah
this power has no roots to guide no role
you have been so long well it is been so long
she said i will make a place between my legs
thought i would caught a glimpse of golden wings
across the cities of the plain
remember? i have got no time
she said it was not at all
heaven in one sigh heaven in two eyes
oh i know she gave me all that she wore
with life in the land of the loving
i will walk with you out to the car
to the eye of the storm
switch the channel watch the police car
you have been walking in the shadow of my death
and his shadow soon became a wife
and when it is all over you will roll over
help me girl help me girl
you will find me resting in the shade
you could try to understand me
paint a picture using only gray
i have made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
i have got this joy in my breast
you know each and every one it frightens me
fallen from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to save me
i am all on my own quietly sleeping in my home
there is some certain people who should not start fires
i am not just anyone said i am not just anyone
why is she searching through the ashes?
is it strange i should change i do not know why do not you ask her [x]
the queer is out of order
i want to taste everyone i see
blankers and boasters all the bluffers and posers
i should have taken it as a warning
there is no time to cry
with those headlights comin' down the hill
i am down to the grounds the very dregs
forsaken almost human he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
there is a dead man in my bed she said
then you turn and run following the fast foolish line
she taught him how to dance and start again
the god of love preparing to depart
listen to me now in the bright new dawn
in the fake-ache of the gloomloom slippers slap me alive!
and of what was following me
yeah running scared what would i do
before i see things the right way up
like a pillar of cloud the smoke lingers
i was born blue and weathered but i burst just like a supernova
i will even walk upon water
but she is all dressed up now
yeah i seen it all in my dreams last night oh yeah
rollin her dress up past her knee
take my books take my gun
just slide out of sydney and i can never go back
and i would tear at your sheet
sayin 'lights out! no burnin the midnight oil! '
covered in a cloak of silence
full moon rising lays silver at your feet
what a fool i was for you
there is a shadow on the road ahead
in the blood the iron lies
all in all it is no one is fault
but i put my face in tomorrow
i have lived too long on my knees
push my bone from the highest cliff to the sea below
i do not look for love that i do not need
dance me to the end of love
take a look and look away
let me hold your hand and be your loving man
and my piano crouched in the corner of my room
so call me now and tell me that you are home
all i know is that you are not with me
wo not need no stinkin' war
you are so like a star upon me
he will say one day you caused his will
i no longer see a future
but she is not really tame
whatever happened to that old song
the walls of this hotel are paper-thin
still i wo not let go
further north the warmth of lovin' lingering
and so to alleviate the boredom
i have called him by every name i know
and say we dig for ore
[how] nothing good ever came from this town
your jennifer she just is not the same
we would see the blessings in disguise
i want you as the dream
them leaving this town in a matter of days oh yeah
as they look to the skies
oh beyond all the graves and the hedges
come take him by his lilly-white hands
sending me so far away so far away
i have seen many strange things
too-ree-ay too-ree-o too-ree-ay too-ree-o too-ree-ay is what i say
i was always taught to trust
she is moving through me even now
and the needle-boy stuck him in the eye
but i need you just this way
get in the car i have something to say
fontainebleau 'cause it takes a shark
a blossom falling from the cherry tree
even though you still may not want to
can you ever get enough of it?
you say they chained you to your fingernails
with an iron fist in a velvet glove
i could not recognize my photograph
a tongue that tastes like tin
how could she do this to me
can you hear her little scream?
and all the children stop to take a look
i will place the sky in your eyes
and throw it in the cyber sea
i do not know why i am crying
and this curve is your smile
you expect for me to love you
his eyes are open but he cannot see
i would put your pretty dress on
i keep a book of reflections
and those wind sure can blow way out there
i was almost there at the top of the stairs
was the last of his kind
my love my love where have you been?
can wait forever for you to come home
it is for all those creeps hiding what they do
do not you think she looks just like me?
to all those chandeliers of hope
into the future that is her destiny
you had a temper like my jealousy:
you will be playing our games
well i sang some sad songs
i am special 'cause i am gonna make you see
in your sizzling shoes in my dreams
he says he looks up to me
now the air i tasted and breathed
and you wo not read that book again
slade tipped his hat and winked his eye
right when the storm comes through
let my love open your door
homegrown is the way it should be
and fuck if you only hear what you want to hear
a rubberband hold me trousers up
and they were silent for a spell
here is a clue to some real motivation
there is a city draped in net
let me bring in the devil dreams!
i am sorry for smudging the air with my song
with a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
oh the way that gravity turns for you and me
i hear hearts beating loud as thunder
and we each have our own set of stars
hey bitch this is what you are
i leave the table saying 'i am real'
and like a moth that tries
see how that building there is nearly built
nothing is gonna change my world
sometimes you are there and you are talking back to me
god only god knows she wo not let me rest
ring the bells that still can ring
in the flying spray of the ocean
used to be your arms around me
leaning out to catch the sun is raysa lesson to be applied
lost nine friends we will never know two years ago today
upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
but i ca not face the dawn
so i will stop when i can find some fried eggs and country ham
i am cold as a new razor blade
if you go i will let the law know
would really make this life feel so complete
bought and sold and bought again
is therefore not to desire her
they brought me the bottles plenty
dog yearswith every scratch it reappears
she said whoa whoa whoa whoa i do not have one
dig a hole in the garden
the tv screen is calling me
my god what have we done to you?
come along when i am finding no peace
a boy alone and so far from home
he is a writer and ranger and a young boy bearing arms
it is a spark in a sea of gray
love calls you by your name
i have seen things you will never see
and there is no-one there to comfort you
there is barely time to go outside and play
this feeling i ca not rise above
there is a hand that protects me
she would drag me through the streets of baltimore
be the magic in the northern lights
this is my time this is my way
turn to me turn to me turn to me
and how things are with you
oh! rye whiskey rye whiskey rye whiskey i declare
and all too soon a canine
dress my friends up just for show
but the house is getting dark
and were it not just for the jewels i would close your hand
but you have still got me under your thumb
i wish i could tear it up
the snow turns to streams of light
i have come home i am so cold!
i was born in a beauty salon
what you have been waiting for
they are rockin' in the white house
that may wet your lover is dream
my life flashed before my eyes it was a horror to behold
when i first saw open water
and then the wind blew under battersea bridge
burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails
with people that i do not know
face it in your or me
but the dogs you say they fed you to
that is how we kept what we gave away
a car was stalled the engine was dead
but these fences are comin' apart at every nail
and you you must try to fly
they call him joe the dragon
i leave my limbs behind me
the wind rose up set him down on his knee
would he make it this time
do do 'n do do 'n do dow
and i i will drink all the time
let me feel you moving like they do in babylon
i told my mother mother i must leave you
and they took us to the streets of baltimore
some are right some are wrong
on a visionary flood of alcohol
to think his niece would be a bride
oh mother goose she is on the skids
and i was so youngtoo blind to see
it is a it is a it is a yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir
so sure of himself his head in the air
careful where you stand my love
is magnified by the things i have done the things i have seen the things i have
i watched the world pull you away
oh yes i need some love
i will stop trying to make a difference
you would let me know when the time was now
a man must learn to give a little space
oh what can it possibly be?
i run around like a chicken with its head cut off
we wo not see the earth again
robert johnson and the devil man
except the body of sorrow that rose in time
the tide of public opinion had started to abate
that the people from the city
i ravaged at my finance just for those
no thought for me remains there
and do not say a word
i said wo not you let me see
for the higher-level static of talk
while a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn
there is always tomorrow when people have their fingers broken
well if you are gonna dine with the cannibals
to live for where it is hid inside
hide your memories hide them all
as someone long prepared for this to happen
take a ride out in my imagery of ages
over to me and again we pressed
many an aborigine is mistaken for a tree
now it is all over for sure
i looked at those around me
i knew that it would save us all
and go to town try to find the energy to stay in the groove
and the whole world sheds a tear
i open your eyes to my world
do not let me see your tail lights
you know it is me cathy!
chorus: four strong winds that blow lonely
way to get me through the day
in my head i hear whispering
i need her and see her
love is deep dig it out
got to find yourself alone in this world
while hope is still in sight
but i want to look around me now
who charge ten dollars at the door
i turn my face i crawl away
i like the things you say and all the things you do
looks like freedom but it feels like death
it is the kind that leaves me alone
with your sorrow and your black carriages
the day writes the words right across the sky
and the night through the window was full of lights
i just want to rock-and-roll you woman
thought you would slip away tonight with me
just like a feeling that you are sending out
hey buddy you know you are
i will tell you all my lies
shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
talk talk about my generationwhat about
feel the sun upon your face
oh darling make it go away
worry why do i let myself worry
though your heart is in anger
and i see through your brain
i would love to be like me
i could not speak i was having thoughts
is more than a man can endure
things seem good again someone cares about you
i do not believe in forgiving
what you own is your own kingdom
do do 'n do do 'n do dow
the places promised by your faith
pour it down the open drain
take me to the top of the city
i wake up and wait up
that is what i will do
i have got to get out of this hole
i am forty-one the moon is full
how can anyone have such little defense?
i love your body and your spirit and your clothes
take the reigns steer us towards the clear
on and endless night silver star spangled
i think of you wherever you go
and we do not charge nothin' nothin' at all
seeing the world as a loaded gun
but i have to deal with envy
so do not burn your bridges cause
but you ca not touch them no
you have never wanted to start any fights
on the freeway in the middle of the commute
the train that goes to the kingdom
wave tops torn into flying spindrift spindrift
well i walked in the pouring rain
yes and mark how the stranger is cold armour
if you were somewhere else then you wo not have to die
tried to endure what i could not forgive
my eyes were shining on the wine
and my handsome little body oddly propped
they bury you when you go and die
he plays fast forward for as long as he can
i know that it will save us all
oh when i get back off my feet again
they try to put me on the tapes begin to spin
it flows through life like water
god i am gonna die blues
if you are walking home alone
got me down on my knees
there is no room for cheap regrets
then i came back from where i would been
balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
go out and talk to a friend
never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
but she says go back go back to the world
oh i ca not stop now
the devil as he is talking with those angel is eyes
like i could even change the world yeah right
i want i want i want
to the end of the road
if you can see me i can see you
as the merchandise exchanged and money roared
and you are not leaving here without me i do not want to be without
run round the houses north and the south is
heroes leaving for the great crusade
it is running out for you
he will laugh and raise his dying eyes
now i know just how much i have lost
baby can walk around the town
the cars outside look like they have got the blues
i just ca not seem to get enough
spitting the dawn come come come along before the animals awake
eurydice is eyes popped from their sockets
some moments that i have had
power play? fix a face?  never grow old
got me in those desert eyes
and all the thorns are a-crowning
too bad i am not losing sleep
i would burn you so sweetly you would never fly off
i can feel him melting in my hand
there is a time for feelin' as good as we can
and please do not move a muscle
you say i took the name in vain
it may take a lot of time
we are only at home when we are on the fly
and my father is hand was trembling
keep us close to your heart
but the will to live is dead
he shot you full of pethidine
hold on hold on my brother
so i just stood there laughing
i ca not resist your gentle lure
gonna write a song so she can see
and in those magazines at night
you said you could never love me
and someone strange in the bed
oh you are not just anyone
hearts and thoughts they fade away
peter pan steals the kids in kensington park
she says c amon baby you know you are my loverman
that is why the deal is goin' down
be vain and smart humble and dumb
you ca not turn back the tide
did he relate the message is clearly hardly
the poor man could hardly stop shivering his lips and his fingers were blue
and the kids gather around with an outstretched hand
and god is never far away
and i am off to find love
i am not livin' what was promised
she knew exactly what to do
you pick me up and you lay me down again
i am going to light up the world
yeah before you get my loving babe
just remember we know your secret while you moan
when you may have them both
while people planning trips to stars
and peter tried to climb aboard but the captain shook his head
you will just have to pray
and how every little thing anticipates you
and when i am but dust and clay
i want to look at life
do not cry till this thing is over
and i smile and i sip my opium tea
some see life as a business plan
and his fists full of pistols in his pockets
and i kissed away a thousand tears
nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai
and in a way i am helping
i believe to my soul now po' bob is sinkin' down
you have got what you wanted but you are on your own
i will be here for you
and you say ok the bridge or someplace later
when a family ca not survive
please know that i got all the friends i am needing
i still believe in love at first sight
my room is home for hours
oh the tears that you weep
the painful scream that i heard last
i ca not help it i am not sure what to do
it assured us that the worst had come true
i see him when i turn the lights down low
but you have yet to be tried!
i will need some information first
mingles with the bright stuff of dreams
that may be very well i said
carried away on a wave of music down a desert road
the candle gutters on the ledge
do not want to have to take you back
would not you like to love me too
like a beautiful bluebird i would come flyin' back to you
you are so pretty p-are-e double-t-y
held onto him tears curling into her mouth
and it feels so much lighter
have you seen the evening coconut
so come find me my darling one
if i only had a heart
she said sure my heart is boundless
well they are hissing under the floorboards
sorrow is child but in sorrow surrender
a shriekin' and dancing till four am
all we ever look for oh a drug
rush okay we got money we got manolos
it is time to start playing your part
did it go out of style?
must have been you i am gonna all night loving you
i feel you each breath you take
but that somethings wrong with me
he wrapped a rag around your face
if i never lived without you
wonders in the world they wrought
sees the dead stacked in piles
out from the underground away with me
but the strangest thing to date
i love the way she moves she moves she moves me
shaking its fists in the air
but i ca not feed on the powerless
because i like to practice what i preach
i am tied to the threads of some prayer
at least until the lights go out
but now his mind is dark and dulled
tell them your secrets they are like the grave
hey no he wished me well
and a knife in his jeans
the winter slammed us like a fist
i do not believe in the stars or the planets
as we release this unspeakable toll
i see you come out of it all
where paint cracks like your face
so an answer now is what i need
the hours hands down a miracle to spend with ugly types
i spit in his face and i kicked him in the eye
and everyone must cry or love
it is catching up with me
i do not claim to be guilty
a spectacle like he is never seen
she sold my secret to the man
yeah yeah yeah yeah [repeat x]
lettin' me knowhe is a waitin' for me
and where where where is my gypsy wife tonight
each time we bathe our reactions
he said what we have got here
'til the wail of the call to prayer awakes me
something my nurse would not have allowed
'cause somewhere there is a place
what you thought was your daddy
then i am taking to the road
she is leaving home after living alone for
there is water on the wood and the sails feel good
some of them learned as a child
ah take me just the way i am
i have been waiting for you so long i do not want to lose you again
i have gold chains and the finest i have
but still they lead me back
yes you think you are all right
i saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
is this just another phase? earthquakes making waves
i have been sitting in my basement patio
yes and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes
you are still out of reach
but then she called my name again
no god up in the sky
you pointed at something and said
oh yeah by thinking we are infallible
when i turn the light off
out of longing great wonders have been willed
nowhere shampoo tv combat boy is own
can he shoot from the hip
two by two they go walking by
it could take me or leave me
we are here we can love
where the buffalo used to roam
as i plotted in the ear of john finns' wife
feel the fear in my enemy is eyes
but i have found it is already inside me:
and beaten by the vicar is wife
there is a pretty little girl
they try to put me on the tape begin to spin
the band fall silent fearing for their lives
this is your captain talking to ya
all the plans that we laid
and pain was the price you paid
so i ca not leave and nothing comes
where do i go to soothe my head
you cut me down a tree
down on her daddy is farm
to my part of your life
yonder go huck minus pocket-watch an' wallet gone
and i am starting to believe
but there is one thing i know
we are of the going water and the gone
and the mercy seat is waiting
yankee russian white or tan he said a man is still a man
move up i do not like this motion
any day now he will come out
there is battle lines being drawn
where are you now my fingerprints?
goddesses of light of sea and sky and land
i got some things i gotta do
she saw the barkeep said o god he ca not be
i was the very reverend freud
there is unrest in the forest
never woke up alone ever before
finding hope in ways i missed before
we are but victims of desire
love would melt me like hot butter
if you will promise to be mine
oh it is gonna be the way you always dreamt about it
let us be two severe giants not less lonely for our partnership
there is a feud going on
the british museum had lost its charm
talkin' back to clock in slow and studied kicks
i do the best i can
i have all the time in the world
here take these before we run away
at the feet of a god unknown
i ca not believe in such things
when i was a growing boy
the nights are hot and black as ink
nestled in your wings my little one
only he knows who you are
you were nowhere to be found
down in the valley it sang to it is friend
like sugar the guests are so refined
where to where do i go?
and twenty pretty girls to carry them down
uh uh aaah let me put my arms around your head
it is a long hard road when you try to find peace of mind
strung out in heaven is high
that waited outside in the rain
and i wo not back down
i saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary
can you sleep alone at night
's murph playing his guitar refrain
the sky could fall could fall on me
his name was always buddy got got do aaah aah aah
he says i ca not give you anything at all
i know you are feeling bad
scared of losing all the time
and when you dream and hear me calling
'twas in the bay of biscay
how good it feels to be alone
and i wished for an embrace
why do not you try to do without him?
and our boy is hardly got a bone to suck!
you know the way to stop me but you do not have the discipline
to let me know that there is a heartbeat
do i have to dance all night?
the butcher bird makes it is noise
looking for trust and i know that you just
you are no better than me for what you have shown
it is like you are waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way
how we talked and drank into the misty dawn
that you keep for your dreams
to see her accusing finger spurt
and all along the fire below would rise
just for the people who like to go down slow
you can come with me if you want to
wish i never put the hose down
heard the lies and i felt the cold
slowly slowly we lose the love that binds us
was not too much fun at all
they moved her not at all
who discolor test tubes in the halls of science
if we compare the first day we met
are we moving towards some transcendental moment?
party time one more town everybody is affected
the thorn of the night in your bosom
we do get up in the mornin'
and these locks cannot be broken
and that is the bottom baby
it is hard to hold the hand of anyone
even though the pain and heartache
cause there is nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
it is here they got the range
ooh find me the man with the ladder
and the only man of energy yes the revolution is pride
i do not want to start
i have faced it a life wasted
but if we would only open our eyes
you can choose from phantom fears
line their holes with the dead ones bread
it is nothing as it seems
seeing visions of falling up somehow
and i saw you in my nightmares
and put a bullet through his eye
i have never felt much at all
i am gunna walk right up and take it yeah
something that is out of our hands
reaching out for the hand that smacked
and i do not understand how come nobody told me
sometimes we are the last to see beyond the day is frustrations
you wo not fit in too well
i just want to hold you wo not you let me hold you
i am barred and bolted and i
so i put him to sleep
get ready tot love! praise him!
i was hopin' for a replacement
each one pushed me nearer the edge
and i was at the old dance-hall on the edge of town
on a bed where the moon has been sweating
moving in there is nothing to see
i am so sick with need
never told me time stands still
and she comes to you light as the breeze
so he starts to roam the streets at night
follow me and you will learn
kiss me again rekiss me and kiss me
land of promise land of might
it is lonely out in space
i do not give a damn about the truth baby
i said to the man who would been sleeping rough
o sugar it is a drag
and that is what i remember now
just like an old time movie
spreading the news around the world
you see i try to resist
just gonna have to be a different man
making me smile and making me frown
you have cut out your zone and the things have fold
dream the hunter on the western plain
bundled up in your mother is lie
within for every second chance it was thy tore
[two by two hand in hand]
i will stand in the light
never want to put my feet back down
moral sneaks in the white house
how many times can you see?
what will the wedding supper be?
you may think he is deranged
or no one will know you are there
you have been following the visions of my god
buzz is still a cop of course
and it is just like you said
then i saw you naked in the early dawn
so i try to forgive 'em any way i can yeah
a pulse of dying power in a clenching plastic fist
let is say i am doing fine
everybody is searching for a promised land
i do not need to fight to prove i am right
and we point them away from the big sky
please see for me if her hair is hanging long
like a bird on the wire
i should not care you are not my darling anymore
or to make some woman smile
oh help me darling help me please
it was then that you lifted me up again
so start falling in love start the riot
or will they tear out the pages of the book
sun touched the cold steel bars
i am talking to all of you around me
it came for me at night
i do not want to lose you again
but i am not about to give thanks or apologize
coming to you at night i see my questions
it is you and me you wo not be unhappy
i have been loving you a long time
and you do not want no more
and then i will ask you why
if i could wave my magic wand
who is trying to get through it
it will only drive you insane
ah we are lonely we are romantic
swinging for the fence got lucky with a strike
the gold is just not good enough
now i have been made weak by visions
just like a crowd rioting inside
if we need too much approval
and i need you to kill a child
oh davy you may have many words
there is a dead man in my bed she said
we have said them so many times:
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away fade away
and me i watch from somewhere as the loved ones come and go
we do not need words we will be birds
you can buy god it is monday
echoes with the sounds of salesmen
leaves school to follow his ambition
oh it is too bad i am not losing sleep
driver drops him at a bar
what it takes to come alive
to give me comfort in the night
well i am down on my knees again
and things that i just do not understand
who loves to sell his name
flew me to a place not far away
and the cold is running thin
to put on his suit and his tie?
with her hair full of ribbons
and no water in the sea
but there is day and night
over the lights under the moon
you can almost see the circle growing
so hold on to nothing and he wo not let you down oh by jingo
they said he is up to his same old tricks
well i am gonna raise a fuss
dispise but it always comes out on the inside
mummy come back 'cause the water is all gone
tell our gracious host to fuck himself
you will long to kiss those red lips
where it is pointless to be high
break up the cake break 'til it is daybreak
but climb on your tears and be silent
just roll over me and you will see what you have found
well i see you there with the rose in your teeth
can change the course of history
well i do well i do
where people work hard and life is gritty
i am having dreams about things
the lens between wishes and fact
what it iswell you are not really sure
no matter what your dreams might be
i am looking for a party i am looking for a side
basic j say are you new here
go on and tear me apart
understand there is a fire to ignite
everybody is looking for a new sensation
i would like to make her scream
a picture book of the rivers
stick another turtle on the fire
yeah it is funny how things change so much
you should never play my harp the way you pluck a string
like a seagull born to cry in the wind
oh come on you have got to use your flow
from your childhood to the night
you bump into a friend you have not seen
help me make my way on home
for my soul to comfort and keep
yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth
and now i have no one to love
on this side of hell father
will keep you up at night
leave the pain for someone else
the shallow grave in your soul
lead on my son it is your world
when people have their fingers broken
when the pain just rips right through me
and 'no-one can save you here'
because i came round here to fight them down
they could not get no relief
drive you when you are down
but that is not the reason why i am feeling warm inside
as we went kneeling through the dark
talk of a time without fear
am i a fool in the dark i do not know
dear when i dance with you
you promised me the ending would be clear
it calls me on and on across the universe
how infinite is space and who decides your fate
to have to stand beneath my window
i can make you all aware
oh no no no i am a rocket man
and all the fat-skinny people and all the tall-short people
his lyre tacked safe under his arm
why does it always rain on
many tears were shed for the blood he bled
like a tear when you sleep i will be yours
i know a way to find a situation
you talk to people eye to eye
and you might see a woman down there
no matter where you run your mile
and fuck me if i say something you do not want to hear
passions will part to a strange melody
party time one more game everybody is affected
it is taken control let is beat it get up let is go
take one last look at this sacred heart
there was so little left to give
and grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm
when all you got is one thin dime
we are deserving of much more
talk to me - do not talk to me
but see how deep the bullet lies
we took ourselves to someone is bed
what they have taken is more than a vow
use your arms for squeezing and pleasing the one that loves you so
all the things you tried to do babe
it is the devil is sidewalk
and the flowers made of stone
it is all a waste of time
to give a love you gotta live a love
the face of jesus in my soup
it is the 'friend' that i would left in the hallway
and no one is left in doubt
i met a little girl in knoxville
cause howre you gonna make some time
snow falls deep around my house
these young boys just make me laugh
sister fight for what you need
come out of the things unsaid
'o come to me! o come to me!' is what the dirty city
and you ran into your mind
so my hand upon your hair
it is love that seizes me
i will help you if i must
i just pray that someone there can hit the switch
there was nothing i could do
it is clear we have a mission from above
lines like these have got to be
bring to me babe yes i would
and a thought tears me inside
on every work on every face
what is human what is more?
this knife feels like a knife feels like a knife that feels like it is feed
you can hear the buildings cry
if you do not push me down
stacks of green paper in his
hey hey yeah i pity the fool
a goddess with wings on her heels
there is been nobody over you
its web was also unique in that it had many layers
the beast wo not go to sleep
curves beneath your flowing gown why do i
i never knew i could feel this way
singing a song that is all wrong
does not mean i will cross
oh get me off the streets
you lick my love with the years
i just need someone to be there for
i would love to get a letter
on a rocking horse of time
i kneel down torn and guilty
it is time for the whip
come back and sing to me to me me
we could get together for some scenes
he is a new world man
i want to run to the sea
got to pick up the pace
the stars will explode in the sky
i will be a vampire calling
the last time that i saw them
put my hands up to the sky feeling alright
there are many in your life
and ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
ca not buy what i want because it is free x
picks up the letter that is lying there
it is a door for when i go
oh my love oh my love oh my love
wander in my words dream about the pictures
they are sick breath gathering at my hind
or what is yet to be
and just tell me to go
we have got five years my brain hurts a lot
and to my heart is desire
the flags are waving the news is breaking
just for now that is all i need
for screwing with their life in freedom land
and the bright light of salvation
she is flown to other shores
wine is sweet and gin is bitter
and in the half light in the half light
and i will see what you have chained to your sorrow
that there is gold in them hills
they will ride you down to the gutter
on the brutal crimes of love
careful where you lay your head
a long-awaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate
told your folks you are gonna stay away
that blooms into the demon flower
after all these years on this old road
somewhere there is a siren singing
then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
do not let it break your heart
and they did not have names
others are works of inspiration of poetry
now you understand why i am running scared
ooh then i really fell for geoffrey our gardener
i need to be by your side
but you did not find me
i need some kind of sign
see it all disappear without a trace
i have got a feeling a feeling i ca not hide oh no no whoa no
smack baby smack is that all that you feel
makes much more sense to live in the present tense
i know forgiveness is the door to hell
we are all you need to know
i was hidden dear hiding all away
and put it all on film
and the tricks that they play
i just know that i like
and the pain will all be gone
media messiahs preying on my fears
another ship ready to dock the rigging comes loose
yeah every eye gaping on john finn is wife
a sword and pistol by his side
the meal trolley is wicked wheels
i was hiding habe hiding all away
i will bleed into your dreams
but i had to tell you then
but if my love is your love
then i sat on the rooftop and i waited
i ca not eat this candy
no matter what is in front of me
do not dump me back there
ken is the leader of the glc!
'cause you do not learn much when you start to get old
and she will find that note that i left hanging on the door
let is stay down here eurydice dear
they were not bad they were not brave
i remember as you touch my hand
i do not feel so fine
and you let go let go let go
we could all die any day
o nancy is body is a coffin
but are you sure that it really was him
you hold me so carelessy close
i may not be the devil
or i might just stop needing you
sweet chariot swing low coming for me
he said it was her fault
i ca not believe what i have seen
and he leans on her neck
vous etes disparus you have vanished
to be my friend in charity
in the land of the free
your maid is new and your accent too
let is leave in plenty of time tonight
do you wonder how we came to be here?
i have been goin' to lukin isi gotta spot that lukin is
i will hide my disappointment cause for years i have been hoping
a billion other blazes are shooting off their sparks
believing the strangest things loving the alien
it is so hard for love to stay together
in the silence that we share
you are heading for the door
i ca not dance i ca not sing
time and again i tell myself
there is a crack in everything
we humans got it all we perform the miracles
you cut me down to size
well they lay down beside me i made my confession to them
i do not need this anymore
they do not eat do not sleep
sadly as i tie my shoes
peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water is flow
there is so much to be scared of
there was a girl hitchhiking with her dog
and it is bad to be alone
he seems distracted and i know just what is gonna happen next
and i want to relate to you
molly is the model in the ads
why do not you ever listen?
while you and i go hand in hand
why i should not spend my time with you
i am never going back again
with a thousand warriors on the ridge
but there is something i have to say before you
her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
things were edging to the right
she is living in the summer of love
we know where the music is playin'
taught in school wo not be enough
soon it will be the phase of the moon
it could all just burn away
the contracts are drawn up the ring is locked upon the finger
i sang my songs i told my lies
and bring it to me now
do you want to know that it does not hurt me?
the bosses get talking so tough
i could feel it in my hair
oh we are tempting fate instead uh uh uh
she lies and says she is in love with him ca not find a better man
but i am gunna go i am gunna go i am gunna go right back roaming
you could feel it all around
once there came a storm in the form of a girl
it is pictured on the arms of the karma man
sometimes watch you walk the street at midnight
on the hill where custer was
could not have put it more plainly
let things go their own way
that even mother could not tell
now you know i would try
but they are deaf in the shadows
if he is truly out of sight
you who are so far from me
someone saying that i am not the same
try to set the night on fire
me you would not recall for i am not my former
so i get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
and the creatures all have fled
the devil fools with the best laid plan
i pine a lot i find the lot
be my mirror my sword and shield
congregate until they are much too loud
it ai not me it ai not me
and i knew it was late
but it is his father he says is an unfair man
do not mean it is over for me
all we ever look for a little bit of you too
oh she move like the diva do
that you be this and nothing more
stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
stepping out of the page into the sensual world
i was the dirty little boy
and i close my eyes and tighten up my brain
and if you go down there anyway
i am happy when i am crying
how can you know it if you do not even try
a little something anything anything i will try it all
you just do not ask for mercy
now in the morning i sleep alone
i am out of the game
they crank and make him record?
the less we know the better we feel
welcome to death in his name
someday you will find everything you are looking for yeah
reborn and baptized in a moment of grace
well do it now do not care how
it is obvious you hate me
you are replaced you are you
you say you find it hard
but it is all just a thought
such fine examples skinny little bitch
you are still looking for redemption
the ocean is full 'cause everyone is crying
and the place is dead as heaven on a saturday night
gazing at hazy goldfish in your swimming eyes
i had a dream of the open water
my hands felt just like two balloons
so i do a slow fade
i hardly slept the night you wept
you know i rowed a little boat
and hey buddy i am warning
she is hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
you learn fast when that is all that you can do
it is the kingdom they would rule
and there is no one left to die
i put my fear back in its box
ah is there room for both of us? both of us apart?
what can i say? i do not want to play anymore
we love to play our love-strong hearts
so i work in that same beauty salon
permit me to accept that invitation
so i dove into the darkness
i am seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
oh and see how i fall
a millionaire through a business man is eyes
it is a random kind of thing
i am listed under broken hearts
razor shivering every ram and son?
the sailors when they saw the joke
i know why you are here
he ca not make me laugh and cry
i would rather die than have no mind
i was not sitting with the gargoyles
lost its way across the sea
fixing what is wrong seeing the people who do not belong we will try to hide are
you have got your secrets i have only got a sleeping sun
a diamond night a diamond sea
the word vows of a mother incomplete
everybody knows the deal is rotten
so do not try to reach out
all that you can do is wish them well [x]
uh you have got to spend it all
[looking at the strengths of every]
but there is a light i hold before me
you are sure looking good tonight!
mummy come back 'cause the water is all gone
before i ever learned to talk
at night i feel the end it is at hand
'cause when all is said and done
should i call her up late
gotta get this out of my head
some of us we do not
open up and let me in
and the trees are burning in your promised land
you can look up all my very closest friends
and he received them with a strange delight
troubled souls unite we got ourselves tonight
she took it from my hand and then she smiled
in the year of the scavenger the season of the bitch
when i talked to your neighbor kyle
like a beggar going from door to door
wo not let ya in for love nor money
the more we think we know about
oh and if you leave me i wo not be late again no no no oh no
tune in to the lonely voices
they seem to help me somehow
like it is your little toy
whips all the bottles that he is drunken
i will stand my ground wo not be turned around
what are we drinking when we are done just glasses of water
people headin' out for the sun
to bring some lovin' here to stay
i am a slogan an old story
from the top to the bottom and then
wise like orangutan that was me
i will get burned each and every night
i know this love is real
i suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes
i remember every word you said
fingertip sun at sideshow stalls they throw the balls
so be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
and through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhere
shootin her with video-drugs-bullets and promises
add up the parts not yours the sum
just a-popping up in my memory
i am not quite right at all
that burns your change to keep you insane sane
we long for just that something more
saying my heart is my gun army of one
the river is going to weep
people love the scene it is all cream
but you are not there or you are recoiling
down here i cannot sleep from fear no
i ca not forget how love let me down
little time in this life sometime it seems
and time flew by faster with life on the sea
i well never ever see you again i know
is there any way that i can help
there is magic at your fingers
and his axe was made of gold
he had a different story for every set of eyes
there is a man who spoke wonders though i have never met him
the golden one or scarred from birth
i would lose my way again
i ca not forget but i do not remember what
if you do not know the things you are dealing
bodies spin in a clockwork dance
act tall with the fire gang whoo walk tall
care were tiny shining objects glass beads dew-drops
there are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning
come over here to where when lingers
and the blind pencil seller wavin' his stick
i came so far for beauty
when you are tired of aiming your arrows
i will walk with my hands bound
once you have her she will always be there [repeat: x]
i just let you walk away i have never forgiven myself
is over before it is begun
it is all in the tablets sneezy bhutan
oh you just want somebody listening to what you say
and sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
even the lost ones you can only give up on
song of love to sing to you
i do not see who i am trying to be instead of me
but it is fly split the sky
oh feelin' understands the weather or that winters on it is way yeah
the carnations dear and the daffodil
wiped a tear caught a train
no more reason see the cloud
when we got to unconditional love
use your heart as a weapon
sometimes i feel like my own name
and there is no man or woman who ca not be touched
impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you have seen before
whenever blue tear drops are falling
a wicked wind whips up the hill
it is been about three days now
so you would better barricade the way out
there is a beacon in the darkness
it must have been rudi is child
it is a far cry from the way we thought we would share it
you just sit down there and you wonder why
for the planets gravitate around you
and i would fall at your feet
you can fall back on us
but he is too full to try
we recorded it and put it into our machine
lucy i know what you are going to going to do
you melt me like hot butter
for i once read a book in which the lovers were slain
someone must have said that slowed him down
when i am all done cultivatin'
for you and me - we agree
i am the fire of life
the moon in the sky is battered and mangled
all those things that do not change come what may
what is the deal? spin the wheel
and i find myself worryin' about things you said
i go shaky at the knees
i stood at the top of the mountain
to a picture-world where i have no say in it
grows up and goes to school
are we bound out of obligation? is that all we have got?
she is no good for you now
took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
i am a pure and perfect lie
and johnny wants pussy in cars
all fears of the forest are gone
i am still here rolling and left on my own
until it reached an open door
it is not like wings have fallen cannot stay
i saw him far below me--
when the world means nothing to me
so lady i am going too
and you know that she will trust you
hey-hey it is a tall ship
sounds and soon my own music! how different it could
oh riverboat just rollin' along through the great great greasy city huck
who looks at me so sly and strange
and where ever we might go
youve left us up to our necks in it
make some kind of joyful sound?
what happened to you my lover?
some reasons will never come clear
to the heart of cygnus' fearsome force
or at least that is what i am told
we do not need a voix in the dark
if we pursue a different aim
ooh dropping down in my parachute
i am on the e kick
synchronized and graceful they move like living things
like the days were carved in stone
up up high on the roof
turn up my collar and mix with dark
she is do not love you
there are flies on the windscreen
but on behalf of us all here
they came to hear the golden sound
like the words i am reading
in the third week of the relationship
without the pain there would be no learning
is that i am lost in your fire below
you are gonna be sick but you must not lose faith
and i am still falling from grace
eyes are closed you cannot know
like it or not we keep bouncing back
was walking through the counters of a national concern
plugged into the sweat of a summer street
when the honky-tonk is all closed
'cause he dresses like a queen
and so on and so on scooby dooby dooby
there is trouble with the trees
i do not want to lose you i do not want to lose you again
the scapegoat fate is made of me
why not even revenge can undo them
is enough to make me feel dull
and i came here to talk
but that is no place to be
there is a lake between sun and moon
i wo not pull away my passion always wins
laughing all the way back from the new town
raisin her host of hair from her crooks
when i get home i am gunna get me some food
you can still find a job
i ca not believe how love lasts a while
see how the man reaches out instinctively
pull the innocent from a crowd
and my heart breaks when you cry in your sleep
we are painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies from
the door is open you ca not close your shelter
well i live here with a woman and a child
oh but it is too late now
you have bought some coffee butter and bread
gaze at clouds that come down crashing
so if you want me then you can have me
tries to be a friend to me
for the sake of his longing
i walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
tell you who you are if you nail me to my car
to a wall in the attic
but i can feel you when you breathe
we have a tiny little force
oh yes i know i am always falling
contraband hiding deep inside her soul
in full command of every plan you wrecked
for the thought that i caught that my head is the event of the season
what she lacks is a backup
with the captain of some sinking ship
i saw the strain creep in
wo not letcha in for love nor money
and the very mention of your name
i am here to pick up the pieces
we are out to sitting here digging you
why wo not you let me die in peace?
never knowing who to cling to
you would be wasting your time
shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru
wind blew curtains off the rod
him and i in the room
and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain
but i will get back on the highway
we found love in a hopeless place
and we wonder what they are
leaving the note that she hoped would say more
how can you know when you do not even try
i do not want to talk about it
'we are here to serve you'
oh-oh-oh-oh through my veins is flowing
and make her journey bright and pure
there is a dead man in my bed
bang bang reach for the sky
i stuck a six inch gold blade in the head of a girl
can you hear the sirens moan?
i am a humanoid logic machine
who is that girl? do i know her face?
well i was only a kid on a holy crusade
and if hope could grow from dirt like me it can be done
i think i want to change my air
the time to hesitate is through
she washed her hair among the stones
suki plays with leo sacha plays with britt
so i would best be on my way in the early morning rain
you helped me when i was down i will help when you are down
a crowd gathers round an angry young man
yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used
in your life in my life
now the old king is dead! long live the king!
it does not hurt when i bleed
our separate paths might have made
the moon was turned toward me
but they nig and they nag 'til they are under your skin
after all these years i am still alive
crystal ball can foresee a change
a chance for folks to meet
but apart from a few good friends
and we are still making love
comes a time when you settle down
dead leaves bits of twisted branches and frozen garden
ca not we just stay there forever? we were so happy
reaped it with a sharpened scyth thrashed it with a quill
across the plain flew the lone grey rider
my passion is never-ending and i will love you till tuesday
tell the captain the boat is not safe and we are drowning
now hounds of love are hunting
want an axe to break the ice
for what you like to wear
there is a way a very special way
all the echoes home to me
as they ask her to focus on
washed away in the pounding waves
i saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
i might just stop loving you
just this pile of old questions
that is right it is come to this
though your promise count for nothing you must keep it nonetheless
i do not want to say it
we do not owe him anything
stand back and see emotion getting you uptight
you called my ace my king my bluff
the carny left behind a horse so skin and bone that he would named sorrow
i will not let you in!
and the prison priests are decent
consequently i have a tendency to be unhappy
when my mind turned on me
vivid pictures like a wall that is standing empty
and granny takes me on her knee
it was going to take so long
what is inside this shallow heart
will leave the black rose meeting incomplete
love is lost lost is love
and above all the bustle you hear
under your tonguei am like a tab
i need twenty big buckets to catch them in
farmer emmerich went into his barn
what ever they are trying to do
the wrong lies on the wrong vibes
without you it is a waste of time
i am told it is called 'the great american lie'
oh please let me come into the storm
princess di is wearing a new dress
sayin 'no harps allowed in the hotel at all'
i feel they have got a lot more sense than me
and let my hands do the soothing
if you listen and only fear
she stumbled in some time last loneliness
and every night when i would come home
to be sung of a summer night on the water
can i see you and shake your hand
come inside and play with me
i saw the sun go down and now it is comin' up
i am a really desperate man
and the writing carved in gold
like any dealer he was watching for the card
dog yearswith his tail between his ears
that goes down in every kitchen
glowing in my dreams like hallucinations
on the other side from you
in heaven his throne is made of gold
now i am gonna close the door
i am just rooted like a tree here
that those who know what is best for us
if you are afraid and need to find me
die a little to get to it
do not forget to turn on the light
deep in your eyes a kind of pale jewel
now at last i am home to you
and me i am on the ground
the hammer that i once brung down now hovers over me
and i have made my decision
will they read of us with sadness
the thought of all the stupid things i have done
well i would have liked to have known you
unaware i am tearing you asunder
but we will come through do not doubt it
tell me when you are sad
it was just the other night
hair of gold and lips like cherries
neither hands nor limbs would burst
you get all smoothed out inside
i have found the problem and the problem is you
by putting one foot in front on another
angels in a ton of sound
and i will bury my soul in a scrapbook
for the wind in the trees
i saw there were no oceans left
a sign that says 'no exit'
ca not we find the minds
you know that ghost is me
the hand that wrote this letter
we are gonna be dancing around
i have been hasty wasty standing on the backstep
and the moon begin to blush
for you i have lived and for you i will die
they bear the cross of coeuf de leon
why do not ya' allfuck offtalkin' bout my generation
you have got to you have got to
dark obsession in the name of love
let is dance let is dance
and we would talk with our eyes
thought i saw an angel laugh and piss on it
it took you a lifetime to destroy
i am a fool for your love
that you are missing the mark?
did not get you this time
and mercy mercy in this world
things could be so different now
and everything i could fit in it
i saw only a stick on fire
yes we are lovers and that is that
take the roads that i have walked along
i will be sleeping by myself
one kiss you paid the price
yes do you think you can pull it off?
and baby he is ready  roar
thanks for this and thanks for that i gotta let go learn to see legacy
over on the rooftops let is get married
you covered up that place i could not master
so do not give me the world today
no we do not know what we are doing here
and a witness who will talk when he is called
and i thought it was me
i was loading a new program
and now you are finally listening
save the nighttime for your weeping
if we do not hide now
i saw boys toys electric irons and tv is
it is like a room full of pictures
who knows when we will be coming home at last
the real possibility that i may meet you in my dreams
and the mountain is going to shout amen!
everybody knows that you have been faithful
it is just a shadow of my wound
a war between the odd and the even
about to make the stars come out
i applaud the actions of the chief
nothing is gonna touch you in these golden years gold
i was there at the birth
when people stared in jagger is eyes and scored
i said little girls play in the house of shame
you do not need words--just one kiss then another
you are the young things fed on garbage and lies
i guess that i miss you i guess i forgive you
and she just looks beautiful in her armor
he will know that you are
it takes a lot to see me hurt
and i crawl back into your open arms
was that marilyn was found in the nude
the flash from a distant camera
i took a virgin like mary
take a piece of my mind
please please give me the night
i am sick to death of hearing things
but the strongest and tallest grows right out of me
and i do not want to live with somebody is depression
and be careful when you are walking in the view
when i radiate more heat than light
i do not know what i will become
i do not no i do not no i do not no i do not
bright white coming alive jumping off of the aerial
oh you have got a way about you
dealing with the fire and the earthquake
hands of this onehands off she cried
why everything will dissolve into sand
wo not you meet me at the gates
and i would sell my soul to keep you safe
leaving behind that empty feeling inside
needles and pins twilight till dawn
an ocean that waits for a storm
saint huck-a-saint elvis saint huck-a-saint elvis
i need someone someone who hears
inside i sat seeking the presence of a god
do not let the fears just start
it is time to fuckin' kill somebody
that men of hope would stand alone
i close my eyes and think how it might be
you have got  minutes to go
ah when you have done a line or two
tell  am it is time for them to let you go now
oh i believe in love and disaster
bounty and your wealth in land
right to the heart of the matter
it was the dirty end of winter
did you know that my love is a liquid?
and when i get back on solid ground
but every time you are near i fear you
but i wake up yes i wake up smiling
so i take to pacing and up and down the room
they had not been near me for years
oh when i get back on solid ground
that you do not want me there in you life
your heart pushing angel from above
this is how to spend now that you have joined the gang
and ask you to be mine?
history recedes in my rear-view mirror
waiting for the world is applause
yeah i missed you since the place got wrecked
you can find your love with diagrams
well you know it is what she needed
i am just not sure you see
there will be some blood no doubt about it
turn me up or turn me down
fill my head with your false feelings
which i do not pretend to understand at all
bakers dozen parades stand and debate
and let your feelings out instead
i feel like i know what my life is for
hear the sirens on the shore
i have got the time if you have got the money
i have gotta pack my bags leave this home start walking yeah
something sensual it is full of fire and mystery
you are harder on yourself than just about anyone
leave the parsley on the stalls
i met a boy who took me upstairs
open up your heart to me
it is hard when you are stuck upon the shelf
but i see through your eye
and all my wanton lust was iodine
'cause anyone who helped you out
if just one wish could bring her back it is sent
you shout it while you are dancing on the ole dance floor
but they will never ever find that cure
till love is pierced and love is hung
do you like girls or boys
to want you to ignore his dreams
but then no-one is clean for long
on days such as these she would
yes i have seen your face before
the little that you see is home
i see your hand i see your hair
who goes straight back out and do i all over again
said the man with the chisel chiseling the surface
it is what it is - and whatever
who turn up unwelcome at every world is fair
magnified sanctified be thy holy name
but that was when i ruled the world
but it must have been a dream
and oh i never meant to cause you trouble
angels the world she chooses she loses
slowly slowly we lose the heart to save us
i am standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
are only part of what i started baby
i can make you all aware
the weapons you are using are hurting me bad
you are gonna run and hide away
and babe you turn me on
but they will end up getting my brother
flew into the light of deneb
monkey driven call this living ha ha ha
and no one knows where the night is going
where is the wave that will carry me?
i would live that day over and over but the world wo not stop turning
still a chance that they will see
and put them in an envelope with my feet?
remember i feel just like you
so i charged him a fortune
i met this chick the other day
i see children savage and blind
so mothers keep your girls at home
and you know that i must say goodbye
but there is still a heart that is beating
i am bored from the event
and the air is full of promises well buddy you have been warned
i think of things we used to do
and my body is on fire
even though all my armor might rust in the rain
chances are i will let you do most anything
flying out of the shock wave
my horse died on the seventh day
with the burning flesh of men
i have been a martyr for love
when i am lord of memory
come over to the window my little darling
when another car passed me by
here come the hills of time
and the truth could not appear
my drunken as a daniel in a lion is den
in the name of something new
because you are treading on my dreams
but i am not fallin' back in the same groove
could do the job that you did baby
he was barely in his prime
i will do it for you
the words i long to hear
stay for a while then you leave without a trace
and the city streets crack and a great hole forces
so forget the other boys because my love is real
i like to think i was immune to romance
in each nation always eager to explore
his beard is white his face is lined
loved her before i knew her name hit me jack 'cos i am
yeah you know the story of the viper
praise him tillyou have forgotten what
with his quick black eyes and black cheroot
everybody wants to know your name
i knew which direction was right
as some things i have seen
your sleeping limbs your foreign hymns
and the things that come apart
pictures on my chest it was you it was you
if you are goin' when the snowflakes storm
blow down the doors it goes down mad raw
give me stalin and st paul
i found my mind too clear
i never felt i aimed at no one
and stay all night with me
i got my hand in my pocket
as the human tide rolls in
gonna leave the fools in line
through the streets and through the playgrounds
but i was hiding dear hiding all away
now when you work out where to draw the line
we are the twilight and stars
the years go by you lose your pride
or lose the race to rats
waiting in your dress in your dress of blue
oh when all is lost and come undone
or it is real but it ai not exactly there
gettin' why i ought to get back
along long beaches and sticky fields
for the sleeping car that is warm
but i spoke not a word though it meant my life
do not know what to do
i will keep this world from pushin' me around i will stand my ground
we would buy the sunday newspapers
i have been down on the endless highway
taking your chances you will have the right answers
in the teeth of an icy grave
the bomb will explode in many countries where nuclear weapons exist
i loved you with all my heart
girls he is the only one
i am a young mariner headed to war
got a tattoo and the pains alright
something is gotten hold of my hand
oh by the time you read this
she breaks out on her own
you want to take me down the aisle
do you fall like rain on the crying?
an ambulance can only go so fast
i could not play that role
in our theaters and bookstore shelves
as the earth to the sun
your baby will never cry again
as the ceiling at which he stared
the longing in your eyes is real
come creepin' up on the land
the sea is around our legs
it began when they come took me from my home
are you my destiny? is this how you will appear?
and it was a shallow unmarked grave
i am just trying to make these good times
something you should not have said
now it is my brother is time
it is all i am lookin' for
from a point on the compass
i have been running like you
from the day i was born
my own beliefs are in my songs
the club the wheel the mind
i have been afraid of changing
what would we do without you?
it turned out to be the luckiest day i have ever known
in death i draw the line
and how love was a vow
'til my family found me and intervened
as the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
find a place nearby for her to stay
a woman is voice close to my ear
and turn to see what that may be
than move around just like this
we are trav'lin' around no time to settle down
do you want to come with me now
and you are the measure of my dreams
a whole hour just to make up your face baby
he was a carpenter by trade
i tried to be good about it
if you are traveling in the north country fair
under white sheets for the great unveiling
why do not you come on back to the war that is right get in it
and you treated my woman to a flake of your life
and if you want to work the street alone
sounds of laughter shades of life
i should be laughing at some good old comedy
sharks fun slices suger-bed slices that pretty red-head
it leaped like a black spider between your legs and cried
days and weeks and months go by
e per noi un piacere augurarvi insieme
but i am still frightened by the telephone
who is it whom i address
but how can i expect the sane to ever know?
driven on --- by the road to somewhere i have never been
from the days that used to be
it reminds me of the skin game
it is all across this nation
i am not singing for the future
and how she was before the years flew by
before these women they all have gone oh yeah
tell me what you are letting in
she is the angel of compassion
i was awaken by the sound
years passed by we were walking by the sea
the wind in the trees is whispering
with a tear in your eye
been on that trip so many times
do not die my funny little doll!
let it roll all night long yeah
and the road is coming to its end
losing breath from the water then i am gone gone gone
look up and you will see me
that does not come from somewhere deep inside us
it is not a style it is an action
about a ghost from a wishin' well
his hair is red as blood
and everybody knows that the plague is coming
seem to leave a hollow sound
it is difficult it is very tough
and when they looked at me
all the things i should have given
in some lost place i had to find
he was not known to say much
i am riding down this wet road
some say that knowledge is ho-ho-ho-ho
let me put you on a ship
o his road is dark and holy
it is a breath of fresh air
live in a fever live in a fever?
to let out to let go of
as it slowly leaves the ground
just like religion you are going nowhere
i am asking you-tell me can you hear my silent scream
and watching from afar i see a child is drowned
do not choose a coward is explanation
i sang a song for the glory of the beauty of you
with nothing but the truth left untold
gotta get a word through one of these days
wo not someone call me 'friend'
i remember it was that wednesday
hey is there anything that i can do?
i need your love love love love love yeah!
you need not try know the whole story
and you say you have been humbled in love
she fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy
all those things we cannot know
i will give you a four-leaf clover
i waited half my life away
she will pay the rent for the use of you tonight
a funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
comes a light feelin is liftin'
the fishes leap up to take a look
she always wants to please you
let you know how i feel
i will put him on the wedding list!
living in a different kind of world
like the ragged boy who races with the wind
to leave you as you are
seemed not to be so strong
leonard just let it go by
live like a fool that is what i was about
saying it is true it is not what it seems
and stuff it up the hole
even though the bills are piling
it is head trauma bad drama they need body armor
i am not sure if i saw it
there in the road up straight ahead
and dressed as a rocket on waterloo bridge
now she do not want to use me
ah but who is it climbs to your picture
he loves to wallow in the glory
forever be yours in this bright new dawn
if you are in heaven then you will forgive me dear
all the useless things my hands have done
oh my god it is been too long
who he made to lie down on red roses
friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
features fuse and your shadow is red
now my baby is gone yeah
and i am still here rolling after everybody is gone
it is impossible to make it today
your faith was strong but you needed proof
and i know too well what is keeping me here
which you ca not reveal to the ears of youth
and there is a light shining in the dark
blink a bright red and green
his life wo not be worth living
in this proud land we grew up strong
but her hands flew from her side
oh how i sighed when they asked if i knew his name
you can believe that it is true
i know you do not listen to me
with the good ones on my shoulder
i was in a state of nature
he said when i grew up he would marry me
we will run with dirty boys
it is been a long long day
ooh let is call in an angel
breath tell me turn it around
and wild gift horses strain the reins
i believe in  virgins on a chain why not why not
forced to kneel in the mud next to me
on what to say to people
the thought of all the stupid things i said
i went down to the place
like a bell to a southerly wind?
there was a chance and i missed it
and i heard it on the radio
'cause they say two thousand zero zero party over
but was not there more than this dull sensation
the times they are a-telling and the changing is not free
to lay down the hard lines
he said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
feel the strength in his hand
i was not ready for her kind
and lady stardust sang his songs
why swim the channel just to get this far?
i have been here all day
give me what i am asking
i heard the hope and the hunger
it is not how fast you can go
you do not have to be alone
give me crack and anal sex
and bluer than the bright that is in the cave
atmospheric phases make the transitory last
i remember the days when we would walk through the woods
thought you burned not froze for your sins
and this is how you betray me?
oh i know you mean to help me
she just ran out of clothes
you have got the spell so break it
primed to do it is educating
hey i do not miss it baby
things that happened in the past
waiting so long i have been waiting so waiting so repeat ad inf
princess di is wearing a new dress
still i wish you would change your mind
jack burroughs says what you doing
i know that heaven is a burnt out shell
the door swings through a passing fable
and when the police take me away
and then all at once he was standing there
do not be like me and let lefty win
something is gotten hold of my heart
where the sun came shinin' through
growing farther away all the time
the two halves of my heart
and i think my head is burning
of aborted plans and sudden shattered hopes
and then i will do as i please
oh speak to me joe speak to me joe speak to me joe
keeping me waiting keeping me waiting
the pain and joy they bring
you have never driven through a red light
i will be loving you always
storybook keeps from hurting me you see
and feel your arms surround me
living in the gap between past and future
to see what i am all about
three days and maybe longer wo not ever find me here
i wish to god i never had
there might be nothing left to do
you kno she lives in apt
but that is all right baby
the lights go out and i ca not be saved
but i was just a kid
bob a coke 'fraid that is past a joke
i come up to meet you
when the storm clouds gather round you
and those misguided there was a plan for them to be
and just when i climbed this whole mountainside
dom do aaah who stands in steel by his cabinet
i am gonna love her till the end of time
like a cross of himself and a fox
the weather warmer he is colder
i have lied and taken off into the day
what would we do without you?
if it is illegal to be in love
makes no difference who you are
[maybe] i will do anything you say
and oh well if i ever caused you trouble
wo not need no purple haze
what half the world does every day
then he peeled his shadow off in strips
when i get home i am gunna talk it through
and all on his way homeward his heart was filled with fear
i need your love i need your care
where do i seewhere do i shine
the morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack
from the ridiculous to the sublime
and you aint had enough to eat
when the guilt begins to hurt
they shimmer like mirrors in summer
but when they go out dancin'
now they are testin' the trap it chills my spine
my heart is aflame i will love you till tuesday
and i know who does love me
a peaceful state - a submissive trait
but i never got the time
she is a picture of the world
i waiting for my one obsession
my heart it tumbled like the stock exchange
seas would rise when i gave the word
if i could holler like a mountain jack
wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away
but i am afraid i told a lie
that you have always been her lover
i was followed by the vision of my god
not this time you wo not
we see you here [repeat: x]
out of the corner of my eye
do not got no problems no problems
the only girls i ever saw
oh i know so much about you
telling you things that are not happening
it is like a breath of fresh air
high above i will break the law
and it is so hard to see you
i would give the world to you
oh johnny lovely johnny would you leave me?
on the end of my wrist
some see life as hope eternal
your body lost in legend the beast so very tame
under fifteen feet of pure white snow
with a vengeance i had never known
for every job so many men
and we just got to turn up to be heard
for now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
well i am up in to keepin' jive alive
well you tell me that your lover has a broken limb
i said yes i felt like an idiot
where these seeds will rise or when
my heart has collapsed on the tracks of a run-a-way train
she will be mine if i pay the rent
and paler than you have ever been
does peace from out of fighting
i am hanging on the old goose moon
when wind turned dirt to dust
the last time that i saw him he was trying hard to get
i hear you tell me how
once upon a time somebody ran
and i will try to fix you
of bringing me to my knees
if i do not start cryin' it is because that i have got no eyes
i have got to know what you have to say
took a vow to live with heart break
you have got everything you came for
this machine motion is sure to break my heart
silhouettes in a cold blue light
in the world that you transform
if i die tonight bury me
now though every thread is torn
junk sculpture turning back to junk dead joe
i cry where is my boy?
to the ocean of my platitudes
but then again i have not the guts
in his boat and through the dark he rowed
cross in china too me and you
with still a million things to say
the time was in the telling
well your enemy is sleeping and his woman is free
she is standing right it front of me
you that build the death planes
so i can see my baby when i leave this world
and then i will lead her on the ground
here i sleep the morning through
you learn fast when everything breaks down
it was only a change of plan?
you open my eyes to the world i could believe
where is my nurse? i need some healing
that were not in my best interests to mention
when twilight beams the skies above
is this how justice never fails?
day in day out accumulating ah yeah
except for the naked truth oh yeah
and the steam is coming off her
put an end to every dream
in a cavern in a canyon
i bet you laughed at me
it is just a blurry haze
winded yet still i am caught
as we sink deeper and deeper
i just screamed 'i ca not get out'
hey-hey all the dead children buried standing
oh what you gonna do you just cry
i gave to one and all
i do not regret it - i will never forget it
yeah when you work it out i wanted to
do we have to wait till our worlds collide
got your head in the clouds
i am living there as well oh
i look out on peaceful lands
and the lips that say come on taste us
but we are not always free
he may seem so very far
for i am sick at heart my dear
it wo not hide your face
still i  am glad you have come along
that is now what i am trying to do
reminds him of his little lady
and here we will find the constellation of the heart
here i stand foot in hand talking to my wall
in the arms of the high holy one
as i crawl to the ground
it is a test of ultimate will
birds go flying at the speed of sound
you go to heaven once you have been to hell
your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
you know i am a forgiver
she will tell you that she will stay
and walked in on it all
trust in perfect love and perfect planning
mercy backed outside her window sill
days connect like boxcars in a train
oh while na-na na-na na-na-na davy dozed
why are you hitting yourself c amon hit me instead
try to put the sins of the past night
here we are in the years
oh memories like fingerprints they are slowly raising
but i just err baby i do i error
she loves to talk into the phone
i am not one to go pointing my finger
while i was wonderin where to start
hey i will stand my ground
are the ones we have been before?
must i kill that woman? must i kill that woman?
you close in and i am so uneasy
someday you will find everything you are looking for
shining bridges on the ocean floor
candy-coated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door
i am told it is called 'the unreality dream'
and pour that ever-loving stuff down on me
you know you know i love you so
the wind lashed and it whipped me
for i am quite content they are all as sane
no relaxing for the boys tonight
see what your fate might have in store
i think i see beneath your makeup
we ca not have it all
clockwork angels the people raise their hands - as if to fly
i am so full of what is right
that at the end of the day
well i can shine like you shine
rewind and what does it show?
i learned your love for life
but who can care too much?
come on stand clap your hands dance
bouncing like a yo-yo whoa oh
oh friends do not matter if you are a man or a woman if you are in love
i see i see i see
she said at last i was her finest lover
the winter air tucking under their eyelids
just between the ice ages anyway
till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
and a society of whores stuck needles in an image of me
i just know what i like
and i was lost oh yeah oh yeah
and is this what you wanted
we were right we were giving
pour it all through my veins
with the answers but no clue
sometimes time is not the cure it seems
jane plays with willi willi is happy again
on a platform i am gonna stand and say
ken is the man that we all need
can truths come out of lying
glitter in the sun like a revelation
sorrow is child steps in the water
let the beads of sweat flow
and then regret you ever left
it is focusing its love inside of me
sometimes when i wonder if you are taking a chance
you were the widow of a wild cat
now you are ready for the real mccoy
and i just ca not get enough
if i do not fall apart
in the common sense of human curiosity
good to see your face again
that is when you have got to play it dumb
i have been workin' them angels overtime
her mind being bent for rambling
who do not seem to see to things the way you do
i have never known or felt in myself so rightly
talkin' 'bout my my my my my mygeneration
for you and me - race is not a competition
to my mother my dog and clowns
between the victim and his stain
here am i just me and my walls to blame
we are dead we are sick and hanging by thread
sought alone to rule the fate of man
some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch
it is in every single man
and it is as hot as hell in here
in my mind there is a scene i see
everyone is saying that you should lie down
and you know nobody asked me how i feel
oh baby please i need some sleep
where you are dancing on your grave
and i hid i am in a wall safe
i have looked behind all of the faces
i am starting to believe it is you are playing along
for the grave will spew you out
i am coming out on the ledge
he is got me where it hurts me
ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe
and beauty lies exhausted in the streets
and there is a rumour that you are on ice
in the canyons of the city
where do i go to fall from grace?
color and culture language and race
you race naked through the wilderness
what goes on in our minds
in the town they were going down
past the square past the bridge
there is nothing to be gained
and the saints go marching in
a scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone
and we pause for the jets--
to a god a king a head of state
painted braves slipped down the hill
i wo not forget 'cause that is a whole lot
and yes it is come to this
'til every drop of blood was sung
the circle time parade of changes
you pick up a paper you read a name
i used to roll the dice
but you are too young to vote
i do not browse around too much
and i laid my saddle down
to the cage to the cage
posing with the little league baseball team
i just want to find out baby
the water is only waist high
friends no they do not scream
well i found a silver needle
yeah piss on the icon monsters
when i am feeling ordinary when i do not know what i mean
it is such a sick picture
and joyously screams out its pain
do not cry my sweet girl
i miss your soup and i miss your bread
if you say hide we will hide
who is the funky sex machine?
now honey where would you go?
is more that i can bear'
all the years we would spent with feeling
singing songs of love to pass the time
when today is as far as we can see
down among the ashes away from old times--
getting my facts from a benneton ad
oh they just try to ignore this ugly creep cowabunga
everybody thinks you will never make it
love is for fools and all fools are lovers
treat her right treat her right
but i am hoping to kick but the planet it is glowing
well somewhere there is a rainbow for me
scratch scape scratch this winning skin
working week is come to its end
the boy walks with his best friend
i am scared to whisper one word
yeah i bought her in a show
let is hear the news come on
they will not take me for a buoy
this is my flesh and blood
a beautiful bluebird came flyin' down
my baby and i we began to fight
there is no knowledge but i know it
give him praise give him praise
from the bank heist last night
i forget what is out there
and all the thing in you way
sometimes i know sometimes i rise
you can say what you mean
grandpa looked like he was trying to talk
just as long as you are there
you are going nuts you do not know exactly what to say
at the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud
so he leafed through a magazine
and all you ever wanted was love
i had a big tall red
this is not a false alarm
she lives alone by the river
seeking freedom beneath a lonely desert sun
are you trying hard are you on the rise?
come and rock me to the ground
do not stoop to strategies like this
she checked into a cheap little place
i believe in what i see
i see an empty shell below me
this wall i built around you
and my friends will give up the fight
i will spin you valentine evenings
but something tells me that you hide
am i yours? are you mine?
love is all you need all you need is love
let me see your face again
but now i have got a venus
there is nothing over there but greed
sometimes the two are just the same
my time is at hand my dove
he is wise enough to win the world
que je me souviens d'eux that i remember them
'cause if you ever leave me baby
it could bend or it could break
by the way you talk you would think
i am fuel you are friends we got the means to make amends
i like the smell of your flesh
moline it seems that this is for me
gonna lay the blame on me not anyone
or dark all my dark for light
and i was nowhere to be seen
we have been waiting all night long
words that should have been said
i am well aware just what you are looking for
we have got five years stuck on my eyes
which is more than one hundred feet
looks just like your face on the moon to me
there is only one thing that is gonna set you free
and you know how much i need you
well if it is so deep you do not think that you can speak about it
i do not know which way
when they drove she sat with mouth open
your fists cai not hurt me anymore
and i ai not no communist
can we be blamed for the security of ignorance
uh huh i got a feeling i think that everybody knows oh yeah yeah oh yeah
he brought them presents with every coins he made
i am gonna sing out and see ya through
i could talk about my programme
wrong all my wrong from right
would not give me two pence for him
tries to forget but he ca not he ca not
come inside you wo not know i am wrong
just lay down next to me
you have bound my heart with subtle chains
yes you better knock knock knock on wood you know i would would
i could get working on my own
exchange graffiti with a disembodied race
you have entered the twilight zone
dead lay in pools of maroon below
those undecided need not have faith to be free
to speedy is place for a while
i am the ghost that reminds death of you
lies in wait at the heart of me
and at the door we ca not say more
well the silence broke my heart but yes
there is a fine line between love and illusion
so hard to earn so easily burned
judy the birds they sang at break of day
i awake to find no peace of mind
i sunbathe for love - dig everything
i will stick with you baby for a thousand years
i can assure you that you wo not like what you see
and anyone who tried to deny you
and it ripples through the crowds
yeah praise him a little bit more
i have seen it all before
that is how you see the world but do not you worry yourself
and he is just to scared to knock
now you do not have to ask
then he threw the bottle over
i can stop you from fallin' apart
but i try to run on
so i ca not find the cure
here i am where i must be
all they ever wanted a little clue
very sane he seemed to me
oh mr faded glory is once again doin' time
death came around forced to hear it is song
whose assailant is still at large
so that you can see them in the night
screamed and cried my name out for a song
i know what you have been doing
how long how long baby how long
knight of wands against the hour
cause it used to be the double l
all the highlights of that headlong flight
and i see no chance of release
you know this little girl is so good for me yeah little liza
oh now let me run away
i like the way you run your fingers through my hair
i know you are right about the blues
as i ask you to focus on
i have been putting out fire
i do not have a dime to spare
and you are lying in the rain
even though you may still not want to
in the middle of the tune his love got up and cried
you ca not know what it is like to bleed from here
but i ca not forget you baby
oh lord i am gonna die blues
moon shining down on some little town
and i will crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one
you did not get to heaven but you made it close
it is somehow so badly arranged
he promised her protection for the issue of her womb
light enough to let it go
over the curve through the fields
meet you on the other side
where the dead come rising from the sea
i am goin' to the roadhouse gonna have a real good time yeah
as her blood pooled in the sheets
they sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
they carried me down to knoxville
but any fool can tell you
maybe something a little more sane
call it blind man is bluff
and sit on a bench for a while
so i look in your direction
filling me up with the shivers
but before you come to any conclusions
why do not you join the rosicrucians
i feel like more than just a number
it opens do not be afraid
do not you know there is so much more
wo not someone dance with me?
and tell me that it is real
but will i see heaven in mine?
everybody knows what you have been through
make your dress all wet and send it to me
i have got a man in the street
do the five day drag once more monday blue
roll roll roll gotta feel my soul alright
all we need is music sweet music
our parents would be beaten for
wo not let the light escape from me
the tears are welling in my eyes again
every time we talk about it i break out in a cold sweat
and i told her to get down on her knees
clear a path to my home
you could not imagine that it could happen this way could you
everybody misses andy we will be seeing him in no time
you see i am all grown-up now
in between the sheets left in limbo
it is hard to solve it i ca not lose face
rain your kisses down upon me
so come on come on we have really got a good thing going
if you do not want it
and that all will be revealed
unwrap your gifts take your time
i love you without caring whom you love
i am sentimental if you know what i mean
the sign that i could not read
his beads are all he owns
holding all the love that waits for you here
well i sold the farm to take my woman
i will make your heart smile
the blackened world grows white it goes nowhere
jo the waiter held me close
i found her on a night of fire and noise
yes he said i was a flower of the mountain
i just throw in my hand throw in my hand
her right fist gripping the skin of his left leg
it keeps me through the day
for you know that i must die
there was a helicopter hovering over your house
she does not need you this i know
kneelin' looking through the paper though he does not know how to read
where christ returns to his loved ones
she is got my love too
have you ever woken up one day
i thought we might get closer
it is so hard for me
your little hand upon my shoulder
i lost you in a london smog as you crossed the lane
my bedroom fills with falling snow
he do not drive no cadillac
you know we will all be the same
working for something that one can never hold
like moses has power over sea
stay for a while while ya look for a whore
when i find myself in times of trouble
you would think it was easy
i will forget one of these days
have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light?
but the thought just occurred that we are nobody is children at all after all
and feel the juice run as she flies
valentines day  june th wednesday july th
or the meal that we ate down the road
i must live with this reality
he likes to work with his hands
now when you work it out i am worse than you
i am wond'ring why the big white dove
it did not but it seemed that way
do not say much for the future
i know i said i would help you baby here is ny wallet call me sometime
transistor radio plays an overwhelmingly sad and lonely song
if you did not come  party
the wind was whistling all it is charms
i have been waiting here patiently
yes and here is to the few
but passengers do not smile at her do not smile at her
it is not the same without you up here
oh please understand i just need my friend
and a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
no no no no no that is a-loving you
i am trapped inside and i will wait for you
i would wish to talk with you
but they cost me a lot more
and i kick motherfucking asses like you every day
neil young - mirror ball performed live on various dates
oh bop do do do do do do do do
ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox now leg-warmers
and everywhere you look you ca not believe the things you see
there will be no more aaaaaaaah!
if i buy him a scotch he will buy me a beer
but though i try my heart stays still
she made a turn on a wooden bridge
well my hands they do not know where to go
days like frame by frame where do they go?
i hope you are waiting for me
life is sad and so is love
giving taking living with one another
hormones firing like a fifty foot roman yeah
o the rollin sea still rollin on!
that left me hurt and ashamed
coach and a six a little horses
i want to fly and never come down
squeeze in all that you can find
who in these realms of love who by something blunt
in a world full of nothing
and i heard it on a tv show
and i keep on chiseling keep on chiseling keep on chiseling
clock is crawlin' round the same
and no more will i say dear heart
wants to run the big machine
hero - lands the crippled airplane
outside the window on the ground
do you think you will be able to pull it off?
they got in their cars and drove home
questions rise and answers fall insurmountable
camera curves over caved-in cop cars
this the warning and the message
i find my wife i call the cops this day is work is never done
covered with leather but it was not tight
baby let yourself fall i am right below you now
when i am rolling with the thunder but bleed from thorns
yeah how long must you pay for it?
dreamers turn to look at the cars
but let me ask you one more time o children of the dusk
my father sits slumped in the
she woke up in a fright
it is too late now cause you are out there boy
janine janine you would like to crash my walls
but you are a natural beauty unaffected
inside your heart i dig for more
sure ai not no republican either
and many songs for you are near
take it in right to your love life
'til it all turned out to be a job
a way a way a way home
and the solution? well from me far would it be
then you try to say you are leaving me
there is nothing more that i can do
it is coming from the silence
now that mountains of meaningless words
in the cave at the tip of the lilly
did not we cry at that old mythology he would read!
and i got time to roll a number and rent a car
which one will lose - depends on what i choose
i am coming 'round to get us
well i lived with a child of snow
as the doors are closing now
your love back come on babe
but i ca not buy it baby
i ask myself do i still care?
he will move all amongst your tangled hair
but why should i give up
and i will tell you i love you
what you take wo not kill you
the seed the curse the jazz of life
if that is what you want
you have got to let it go
she is no good for you baby
as the red tide covers the shore
shoot an apple off my head and a
to find out what they had lost
see how it sings like a sad heart
i am scared to sleep i am scared to dream
no use runnin' away and there is no time left to stay
to count the soldiering meandering whales
i could use a lil' company
hey hey my woman looks good to me
lord get me out of here
and all the chances that fall your way
then i soon learned she loved those bright lights
there is no-one there my friend any better
what to do? what to do? what to do?
they take me deeper and deeper
oh you give me life please do not let me go
getting so much resistance from behind
i will take you to the highest mountain
i want to feel you touch my pain
so get out there and rock
and the statuette crashed crashed down upon his head
but there is one thing you could do
till he came to a place called the bucket of blood
all i need is a little shade
ah lover come and lie with me if my lover is who you are
we could do it we could do it
by the way we grow old
and you you can be mean
hear them say you are out of sight
well what you see staring out at you from a photo book
how long i wondered could this thing last?
like a stone in the river
and then out of the night
i am scared to touch too tense to be undone
that is how you see the world do not you worry yourself
anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others
do not know who else came to kneel
but you are feeling so bad 'cause you know
i was fired from her crutch
i do not want to be held in your debt
my eyes just did not seem so bright
mean street i would love to see you die
well i hate to say the farmer
and the whole damn place goes crazy twice
when i past by all the people say
your fragrance with a fume of iodine
get some flesh to stick so they look like us
what would they like to find?
there is a town in north ontario
it is papa do not peek papa cover your eyes
there is a moon so fine
it is got to be you
you that build all the guns
fall to the ground then i wake up
no i do not it is true
trying to reach the other half
i just pay while you are breaking all the rules
i do not need this name
i have to believe that sin
and say you will come and set me free
when i get home i am gunna unpack my bags
i am related to my enemy
are all lionhearts put in parks apart?
your beauty on my bruise like iodine
tell me he had to go
i thought i was okay alone
and nothings is better than [?]
these lines are change so fast
and you will believe what they say
do not want to hurt you baby
but i hear him coughing all night long
like a chicken with a fox
well i guess there is nothing wrong with what you say
a-just a little drink that i could swill
so now i am just a shadow on their bleeding hearts
then i will wait for you yeah
but he did not have the money for a guitar
all my nerves are naked wires
the moon is in the gutter
and i will believe in you when you come for me
now that the holidays have come
i was screaming louder as the
for the business man and the fisherman
but whose head is this she is dancing with on the threshing floor
let is have a black celebration
i got my time machine got my 'lectronic dream
from people who nearly died but survived
and then i wo not be far from home
with your eyes turned up above
still i have to turn away
all the lonely things my hands have done
he is yet to come backbut i have seen his picture
get back and get that lantern out of my room!
the world is so loud keep falling i will find you
no more evil to stun with the slap
walk with me with the rapture inside
and i am only at rest
but it can be taken away
save alaska let the caribou stay
i am on my own nowhere to roam
as a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
and i do not know why you are so far from home
in the folds of her coat
oh please let me dream it is christmas time
silver star studs on my duds like a harley in heat
sadder still to watch it die
my soul has comforted and assured me
write me your poetry in motion
green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
the cradle of the best and of the worst
got one eye on the road and
there is a sun around the bend
i will be waiting for you
they have been puttin' 'em all in his hand
takes a part of me takes a part of me
that shines above the grocer is store
spinning around my little room miracle
and how could anybody deny you
a violator of the law of no feelings
i have your love on call
he should not have said all the things he said
sake and strange divine uh-h-h-uh-h-uh you will make it
the thames was black the tower dark
now you can say that i have grown bitter but of this you may be sure
demand tough hearts demand tough songs
i will examine every inch of you
there is always tellin' in the big room
we are runnin' outta time tonight i am gonna
he is got to make his own mistakes
will you let the fire die down soon
seems that needlessly it is gettin' harder
it could feel like falling in love
do not know about you but my heart is not in it
just close your eyes and i will be there
you think you only know me when you turn on the light
be from the music of the temples! i ca not wait to tell the
i knew the words of every song
radio transmission that i have to know
the little that he frees is nothing he believes
you have been a free bird
it would beat all night for you
a sigh a cry a hungry kiss
in the crowd stands mack the knife
the dazzle of light the rape of life
and fry them if i could?
and that there is a photograph
with a helping hand to lend
come on ah come on ah repeat ad inf
how many times did you call me
is not that a great saying?
while your kneel at the feet
the hours tick away - they tick away
if she is black or white
that is what i want you for
perhaps that is what no one wants to see
i would even be a number just for you
when i am rolling with the punches and hope is gone
my friends do not call my friends do not
look up to the sky pray before the dawn
all the hatchets have been buried now
it is too real go get steel
i would be running up that road
every old sock meets an old shoe
of all the people in the world
i want to talk i have not got enough to say
the suit coats say there is money to be made
there is something wrong with me chemically
for the rain in my eyes
gone going for it all this time i am gone
she said only you can understand
and the building scrape the sky
for the office and leave me
his muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete
yes and i wonder why sometimes
that you are merely a child
moved my soul is on fire
when i arrive it is gone
he strung a wire in between
she by my chinny chin chin [buying chilly chin-chin?]
a wave toward the clearing the sky
do you wish that it would stop?
step out of your cage and onto the stage
it is on america is tortured brow
i am free to give my love
of the only world that we see
you asked at the local constabulary
you have been gone too long baby
everybody knows that the naked man and woman
does not care if he gets hurt
stood by the side of the road
and be your sweetest self awhile until i ask for more my child
but as the time goes by
gotta get past the negative things
people try to put ustalkin' 'bout my generation
we will wave before we are gone
upon this my dreams are depending
lets do this thing it is doing right now hey
smothered me my lover with her beautiful black hair
i watch tv - what do you want from me?
i do not know when i will be up
when the rivers freeze and the summer ends
now we ask the price of the land
all the colors look brighter now
she says oh c amon baby that is no way to behave
wo not you save me save me
and the weapons turn to wounds
said do you feel it when you cut me
she was looking for a ride through the night
oh i am gonna die blues
you are the woman with her legs apart
the joy and pain that we receive
it gets so i feel like
horseshoe man is been working his magic
and the fields they are under lock and key
no victim need limp to the stand
there is a lover in the story
i get my back into my living
in the city where nobody smiles
i will end up alone like i began
i know that i am sinking
it is good to see you smiling
yeah you think that you are right
johnny looks up at the stars
oh thou who givest sustenance to the universe
guess i will turn on music instead
but it is catching up with me
he was just a rookie cop
it does not matter what they say
there is an upside of down
your eyes are soft with sorrow
come on stand clap you hands dance dance
now the fourth dimension is crossed
'cause the goddamned thing it works just fine
i do not need to be forgiven
now i have heard there was a secret chord
baby you do not know what it is like
we all live in the same museum
go on and live for tomorrow
you gotta hold onto someone in this life
and she is dressed in black
i just sit back and ignore
he will build a glass asylum
and she is standing outside hating everyone here
and i call up the mayor and he is out to lunch
and we will have a bunch of screaming brats
do not tell me secrets anymore
i slide to the nearest bar
oh i hoped you would be someone new
how it all just came apart
how do i feel? and how do i
all in a dream all in a dream
so all i have been on my knees again
lie there lie there love henry she cried
look up my number if you want to know why
can we still stand side by side
maybe a red man i do not know
just for a kiss or two
but if the road leads back to you
it is you and me wo not be unhappy
could be we are in a dream
well the cats on the rampart sing merrily
jump off the roof  proof listen
she is hot enough to burn the house down
not the thumbnail of a screen [?]
that does not like the short man
been so long so long so long
such as waiting rooms and ticket lines
till every taste is on the tongue
and you you will be queen
i am ice and dust and light i am sky and here
they zigzagged into a conservative end
i do not know if you will love me for it
are there no more saints and wizards
the first and the last are telling it all
and through the woods the music rang
i feel it all around me
you will fall into her like a pillow
i will swallow poison until i grow immune
who i would walk with down to the altar
i saw you at your best
we drove to work by proxy
my girl turned blue as an iceberg do
you ai not got no money?
got you down on your knees
she said you ai not look like you scored in quite a
now i am not looking for absolution
when we are lost and do not know where love is
and in it you will find something new
sashay on the boardwalk scurry to the ditch
marry me marry me alive o
ooh i just know that something good is going to happen
i can see angels standing around you
feel the heartbeat in my mind
thanks for all your dark gifts for which i have got no sympathy
poor orpheus woke up with a start
until he knows he knows who you are
o lord you know that i must say goodbye
and all that he sees is nothing he conceives
c amon and let me live girl!'
my life it has no destiny
'cause it is such a long way down
it is a hand that rocks the cradle
said something i did not mean to say
reflected in another pair of eyes
we are the ones who draw the line
but on a bright and sunny day
you ca not help but look me in the eye
lurking about in no man is land
get out as fast as you can
i am the hole in your heart
know that i still remain true
precipitation which side are you on?
oh man she is leaving you
there were people standing all around
i wrote a song for you
she looked so fine i said
there is a better life for me someday
dreams of a letter is death
i i i am still alive
sat for a spell there and i pondered
when he wakes up on the sea
no fear of failure for that crazy fool
went looking behind every door for you
and she will bolt and she will plunge
and i know whose going with me
others they got none aw huh
o say goodbye to the little girl tree
all the boys together we can stand
most of it in the dark
like the heart of the earth
my heart goes out to you
she tells me i am too sensitive
yeah i swallowed my breath i went deep
stop it - i know this shit sound mad good
i do not know the answer
i got bugs on my skin
and i want to be free
do not give me speeches 'cause they are oh so droll
lit by the glare of an la fire
hit you in a soft place
they kiss come and they go
you are lazy crazy hung upon the insane
o money lender! o clover gender!
and in the glow of the moon
and a word that wo not go away
i look at the stone apostles
family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
sing you songs with a happy ending
oh morning come bursting the clouds amen
till we remembered our first lines
fuck to procreate till they are dead
you wo not find a girl in this damn world
and you are always in my head
so your head upon my breast
as the simulated rainy season begins
there is a piece that was torn from the morning
and i wondered how long she would stay
and the meanings that get left behind
swaying to the screams of men
you think this is easy realism
but he is got a great view
when will the time be right?
call me just do not say the name
now if you intend to show me disdain
give me a jingle uh when you get in
eyes no eyes there is no difference
in the kindness of god to man
i clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed
if nothing is everything then i will have it all
all that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive
remember it is true dignity is valuable
and the boys that we were
and the song must be sung
here is a meaning for my life
was a sound that could kill someone from a distance
but god would not lie down
yes i rise up from her arms she says i guess you call this love
she knows how to stand in the corner
yes she said yes she said
as they spun on the gravel at clandon
nobody loves you nobody like me
too late to fix another drink
i fell in love with the actress
and be standing here beside you
the ghosts that have taken control
grasp at straws that do not want grasping
o we will know wo not we?
i am not the same man
said the widow is best friend ann
who takes down what i confess?
all i know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
it is nothing to feel ashamed about
what does a confession ever do
do not touch me with your painted little fingers
they have lost all of their feeling
what is up? what happened when i was not around?
we are familiar with what to do
or the crumpled paper it was written on
go tell her go tell her
i will get away from this
i hear screams that hide the voice of god
where the winds hits heavy on the borderline
this sense of humor of mine
i feel a sickness a sickness coming over me
lefting and then righting it is not a crime you know
yeah only love can break her fall fall
just take this longing from my tongue
tough-talking hood boys in pro-team logo knock-offs
inside your heart i cry for more
two hundred words we live in hope
i know you have a little life in you yet
there is east and there is west and there is everywhere lying
no one to stick with you till the end
they do not feed they do not seethe
the voice of youth the hour of dread
you know how hard it is for me
while you are having your fun
michi ni ishi o nage reba
but you are from my side of town
so we picked up our tools
just ridin' so free and easy in the sky
o baby i have come too late she knelt beside his feet
and i ca not stop now
there is a time for livin' as high as we can
you got what was comin' too
maybe as his eyes are wide
oh you you walk on past
she put her hands inside of me
she is gonna take a train ride
but you ai not got nothing you are on the run
i said to myself where are you golden boy
they paint my car like a target
and just when it seems as though
do not bother knockin' on my door
i thought i heard someone crying thought i heard someone crying
so you start reading all her books all her magazines
big enough to let go of me?
it is like we have got a big hole in our side
everybody wants a box of chocolates
run like the wind as excitement shivers
i saw a glimmer from in her eye
ah i do not believe you would like it
she is a little pilot in my mind
oh i spin around with shrieking tires
into the paper bag at her side
and the red tide washes ashore
i loved you baby way back when
i used to treat you like a lady
and i stay in bed all blue i have seen hell
without the hurting we would never change
the heart of a lonely hunter
oh that you are gonna need me?
i am looking at the big sky now
comes out of the caves once a day to be fed
and i know you know where that is at
and i have been lower than you
and ask him and she will give you
slap that baby make him free
all of the moments that we will be
i could wear your new blue shoes
that he nailed to her feet
as he died to make men holy
and that i will have to pay
made out of her wedding veils
he is got a force field and a flexible plan
are forgiving yet needing forgiveness first
you leave me calling her name
we come into the world and take our chances
feel it rising yea next stop falling
if you wanna see what is inside of sally
i will rise and fall let me take credit for both
if you are the healer i am broken and lame
you are there you are there
rain until you got nothing left to give
james are you selling your soul to a cold gun?
they are traveling the holy land
you just want somebody listening to what you say
they would not tell who healed
i watch the sea i saw it on tv
every time i am feelin' good
that the caliphate forced on the jews
my ship is not coming and i just ca not pretend
i just need someone to be there for me
but i had to get away dear hiding all away
huck whistles like he just do not care
the way you leave me wanting more
pushing back the tears 'til the pain disappears
oh let me touch your fragile face
i was dying in a big machine
the hand of authority said no more to
i am getting tired getting tired
from days that used to be
they can relax and watch the sun
and all i have said was just instead of
open eyes and wash out 'tear'
and some even have names the executive dream
a fitful dream the morning will exhaust
o take me to the slaughterhouse i will wait there with the lamb
you are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal
they will split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
and i am covered it is true
but i see what is in my way
and i will die in the flames
with a whisper everything you are
a way to get out of it
only love can break her fall yeah
send her my love for me
down here where i cannot see so clear
i am the distance you put between
and stag filled him full of lead
yeah i got a feeling yeah yeah ah ooh yeah
gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil
oh the waves are going out
of a ship they would bin sailing
i am so nervous in the night
but they have changed the names now
do not like long rests i must confess
to escape the stench of human corruption
never mind she got the guy
there is a girl on a ledge she is got nowhere to turn
yes there is a storm rising
now the day feels so complete
these new romantics are oh so boring
do not know what it is
close your eyes pay the price for your paradise
and laid down with the blind
just erodes us and see roses
let is jump inside and take a trip to town
is fastening my ankle to a stone
one morning when i was ridin' in my old pickup truck
had died from the lack of it
a confidence man but why so beleaguered?
oh man! wonder if he will ever know
and shakes 'em up like he does not care
be the magic in the northern lights
go under the leaves with me
now you are running in circles
sister to the boy inside of me
the pain i have been subjected to
like a song you forget and i am yours
i have heard it all before
i was your father your son
off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
that my name is on the line
and found a cow suckling a serpent
and there is no turning back this time
hail this joyful day is return
i wish to sing the chicken song
we do not need him anymore
so you do not know where you are going and you wanna talk
sister 'coz i am your brother
he wo not speak to me
petrol and blood at last dripping together
people use their super-human powers to discover the dark and dangerous world
that will keep you going through the show
that i woke up in a cold dark room again
todays' the day our younger son
i knew from that moment on
oh where oh where can my baby be?
when you heard the solemn knell
was the war between the water and the bridge
your tears will be trembling now we are somewhere else
what could be nicer for you
i ai not no fortunate one one one
now i am all alone again
new way of looking at life
maybe i am on the ropes
but it is all i can do
come on take my body baby party
oh i will wake up to any sound of engines
i am afraid of the world
is having we did not know it was wrong
all the stages we passed through
they gave all their ghosts away
well that is if i remember the way
because i am willing to wait
i do not like the sound of it
tears spring to mind when i go back in time
there ai not no magic in 'em
each moment a memory in flight
yeah she knows how to please me
try to set the night on fire [repeat x]
and i still can hear him say:
chase the sun around the world
in ruins sunken below the waves
soap wo not wash away your shame
the troubles came i saved what i could save
the slim and lovely virgin floating among german beer
they will get nothing from me
i am a-wondering if she remembers me at all
and i am already cut up and half dead
i lived but to be near you
i am talking to you now
and awoke me to a particular point of view
what you love is your own power
she is a walking love machine
where the cure is always death
but i look into your eyes
fame fame makes a man take things over
oh no oh no i will be your brother
all those lost bodies just seeking security
wherever she goes we will be there
so cruise me babe cruise me baby
if we get too much attention
the mangolias camellias and azaleas so sweet
if you change points of view
on a road lit only by fire
holding hands are daughters and sons
well i pity the fool i said i pity the fool
and now we are out of love
yeah but that is when i will be there always
the stars have been torn down
you have been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
you will be down on your knees
i have no-one to talk to anyway
they will stand before the glass
there is a light a very special light
painting my sleep with a color so bright
i insist that you cut in
oh she wo not feed himafter he is flown away
i want to drown in your misery
jazz police are working for my mother
and beat you with his gavel
she packed my bags last night pre-flight
or notes that fall gently like rain
shadow on the things you know
and do not mock me when i say
that is right c amon sing the song party
more and more human beings make connections
you can stay if you know your lines
my cheap violin and my cross
oh sing of summer and a sunset
i said yes i was an idiot
winking and awatching at john finns' wife
some need to pray to the sun at high noon
going for broke going for another chance
o preacher come closer you do not scare me anymore
are you gonna break down and cry?
but when yesterday becomes a memory a memory
captain sat in his deck chair
to blame her all would be a lie
with your lips and your smile
breeding in the thoughts of ten-
i am old enough not to care too much
[why let them ]oh let them fight
trying to save their own lives
call me up baby and i will answer your call
in a citizen of the world
there is nothing that can move me
yeah on this heart of mine
there is a man with a gun over there
the odds are there to beat
all the advantage this life is got on me picture a cup in the middle of the
you wake up in the middle
hey you there with the glasses
harm in you and in me!
i feel you your rising sun my kingdom comes
ordinary acts of fun have been diluted
i would meet you at the store
i have been sittin' upside down
are they bleeding all your colors into one?
you gotta get behind the wheel
when a voice loud and clear
we could not even catch the cat
when you think you have tried every road
there is nothing to keep them down
crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
she could not have made a worse move
there is still crime in the city
bare their gums when they moan and squeak
slipping and sliding and playing domino
thinks he will get the girl he will only get the mechanic
last night i heard the bells of summer rapping
wow this ai not the right thing to do so let is go
of all the stars i have seen that shine so brightly
she fell down on her bended knees
you are going to feel much better
'cause that money is all gone
you never really have to tell me what
now she is got you dragging her to the station
the time between wonder and why
no the minute i saw your face
just for the sake of love
the more they stay the same
or i sit on the air
the house dogs are in your turnips
and the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour
the devil stood at the foot of my bed
so on a concrete canvas and a glow in the dark
oh come on back to me babe
i do not know who i am
all the truths i tried to tell you
i will let go of you gently
with my johnny on the banks of red roses
but one day the streets fell silent
to a place where your troubles ca not follow
i am waiting oh but do not leave me now
finger in bottle and swingin' it still
bad hep with the fire gang hey listen up
cause i have left that girl so many times before
in a way that is right for our children
i swear you do not listen to me
she knows that i have been doing something wrong
to be perfectly honest i do not know
ooh i pity the fool let me tell you that i pity the fool
and contain the blood i would have shed
or you are gonna be left out
this world can leave you broken inside
you have figured out the score
everybody had a good year though we never saw the sunshine
knights who would give you anything
and now it is all too late
you have got one more chance to leave
your absence is what breeds this fear
what kind of magic spell to use
so what could i have done
you are wondering if she is thinking about some other man
but i have never caught a glimpse
come on love i will see it through i do not know why
she whispers that i am a poor kid
in my rational point of view
for such a long time now
hoping for heaven hoping for a fine romance
i am not shy i am just pissed
ca not you feel it rising?
see the stars they are shining bright
i must work on my mind
and shinning it down the vine
i listened for so long that day
who is gonna dry your cryin' eyes?
they play the same territorial game
i have been trying hard to reach you 'cause i don' know what to do
murders on the heels of love
or you can come to terms and realize
by the sound of thinking metal
but i could not think of anything
why ca not it be mine
earth and moon and sun and stars
when you got me open handed
let the truth of love be lighted
there is such a fooled heart
and then i ran my tin-cup heart along
do not allow no cameras in the big room
let is everybody carry on carry on
by the dawn is early light
o you recall the song ya used to sing-a-long
they will try telephoning my mother lay me low
for 'tis either you or me is betrayed
will see how easy it is
to the ground comes a bit of a tumbling
il n'est qu'un jeune et a l'ecole
how can this girl be me?
the stocking drawn reveals the end of sight
you can almost feel the planets glowing
but there is a trapdoor in the sunimmortality
in the trees in the trees
and i will go all down the row
so then i took my turn
hello i know that you have been feeling tired
is there anywhere you want to go?
these games that we once thought we would be scared of
i see you in the subway and i see you on the bus
when i heard that you were gone
you would not let me anyway
oo she is gonna take her a shotgun pow
yeah said roll the end is always near
i guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far
well i just wanna scream hello
i got memories i got shit
feel like dan dare lies down
think i will go out to alberta
and the men who hold high places
in solemn moments such as this i have put my trust
who in the sunshine who in the night time
and i saw the multitude of faces honest rich and clean
her white stockings and red dress that goes
that just wo not go away
for fear your grace should fall
and leave the dead beneath the ground so cold
you ca not stop meaningful teenage cries
on the bonnie bonnie banks of red roses
the women in this town are being misused oh yeah
i believe in the state of love
i will miss your fairground hair your seaside eyes
when all the world is warm and tired
i just put my hands up to the sky
i do not know how i am standin' here
somewhere she glows divine somewhere she wakes alone
wo not you come along beside?
why are little ones born only to suffer
i thought you were a racing man
hiding out in tree-tops shouting out rude names
oh ceilings few and far between are the legal halls of shame
your brain feels like it is dead
take a quick butchers rotten mary down the oak
there are ghost towns in the ocean
this is the faith from which we start:
the new widow sobbed beneath her vale
i am your feelings and more
oh i oh i am still alive
seeing breathing believing in one another
hear those crocodiles ticking they go ticking round the world
through the ghettos and the barrio
some will live to love another day
we act with reason and heart
who will give you his applause
i hear his voice on tumbling waves
we could dream this night away
drowning in rage like a poisoned emotion
you know you make my world light up
in fascination with the eyes of the world
growing old old old old old
you got to be strong you got to be bold now
the watchmaker keeps to his schemes
well i swear i seen that girl before
suddenly i realize nobody knows me
let me show you the world in my eyes
now there is no more oak oppression
and choices got to have voices
we would give you a part my love
and i thank you for bringing me here
but you cannot lay down those memories
when night time comes calling on me
why do not you come on back to the war do not be a tourist
i got lost on the human highway
he looks just like me a mirror
and he sinks the needle deep
then it touches me and i try to scream
some of us play with you
we bought a lot of things
my friend stole my sweetheart from me
where do we go to draw the line?
down all the years down all the days
blinded by faith and stories of wonder
at times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
your passing is not what we mourn
i am old and i have had to settle
she said whoa whoa whoa whoa you must be the prophet
tell me what i want to hear
their grissom faces like dying moons
recently as i was waiting on a dream
i got some questions to ask
but i just ca not do that
do not stop and do not stop
lies the land of sweet surrender
i got a woman standing beside me
that steel hull freighter was passin' its time
i think she is dancing what do i know?
like the seed of a lie
but i am stubborn as those garbage bags
they found mary bellows cuffed to the bed
i am the demon that waits inside you
and i have heard you everytime
another habit sentence him up with you
sweet memories flashing very quickly by
wonderful teachers ready to teach me
he said just put your feet down child
catch us now for i am your future
run for the shadows in these golden years
the hustle' nothe bustle and the green-backs rustle
you do not even have to give me
that led to the wrong tendencies
so the time will pass more slowly
boo hoo hoo cry cry cry
so let is roll baby roll
and who is gonna take the gun away
well the river is so muddy but it may come clear
chris: you know we have got to find a way
a stillness fell a sudden peace
and i flew into a frenzy searching high and low
it whips the sand into a flying spindrift spindrift
a man with an eyepatch and a bent bloody hook
and edith ran out in shock
ai not a free place it is not a free place
the world awaits just up the stairs
we wo not be there to snitch
say what you will i do not care
yeah! come on lets go out! come on!
he did not even barely hardly speak
and all those things that you meant to change
it bends and tears and screams
three days and maybe longer shed my skin at lastshedshed
i was bittenmust have been the devil
i do not have to understand
and they nail my good right hand
and i am not asking you for emotion
work is been sent our way
on the plot where many feet
c amon baby c amon darling
yes it is been so long so long so long
cannot forget you are hiding collected wounds left unhealed
rested and fearless cheered by your nearness
and i think something is going to be horrid
the white city she is so beautiful
sometimes i wonder if the holy ghost
said it is ok do you want some more?
why take the smooth with the rough
but when they sing i uh
it gives life but it takes it away my youth
like i am supposed to do
give the day a chance to start
so when things get too tough get too tough
we just want you to know we can see through your masks
all they want is your heart and soul
now i put them it is only good to you
watching others pull into their homes
oh what i would not give for just a moment to hold
i love far better than thee
to leave you stranded in dreamland
and a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal jaw
ah there is no comfort in the covens of the witch
my heart is beating ever so quickly do not shade your eyes from the bright new
you will never know eternal peace
do not see no tears around me
well i say as i look back
we live in homes talk on phones
hundreds of years in the future
i would call a doctor if i had the time
oh i am just trying to explain
would i cut off all my toenails
my friends i will say it too
go! go-o-o! from her to eternity!
he said he would marry me too
to dance or to breathe or to dance
want to see it go once and for all
to the top of the hill
and a cherry blossom falling from a cherry tree
yes it might happen i am all ears
in his dreams he is choking ti leaves
can i see your sweet sweet smile
you could say i am the nazz
when i rush to greet you
and was heard to roam the ranges
i ai not got nowhere to go from here
been waiting for this moment been waiting all week
the river has started to freeze
frown ? in my eyes showing nothing
listen as the crowd would sing
i am a stupid fuck i do not know nothin' at all
i began to warm and chill
if i could just live my life
for you are a lazy stream
i could not breathe holdin' me down
and look dear heart look at the virgin
do not pack themselves together and run as one
i am a rollin' stone all alone and lost
with my fate in the air
were lines that i could not change
and twenty pretty girls to carry
to hear the words you say
but there is no other way
forget the pictures on your tv screen
you fake and shook you wo not get off the hook
you asked a famous cook if he would seen me
but it waits for something in my soul
and at night we are on our knees
i wo not say it again
they did not have no place to go mmm
by the time it hit the window they were wakin' up
and the wind did howl and the wind did moan
i just had to take a dive
for the girl you have in that merry green land
you need only trust your feelings
things you would expect to be
seemed not to be so strong
as the heart and mind collided
got my sights on the stars wo not get that far
from your head to your fist
but the feelings gone and i just ca not get it back
everything that you need is here tonight
when he was sick she comforted him
i give them what they want to hear
yeah they say two thousand zero zero party over
flashbacks for an hour or more
and you told me all your joys
i do not want to go
i take my orders from fools
god send the only true friend i call mine
thinking i balled just another young girl last night
we were locked in this kitchen
golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
my life is been funny that way
in this world so cruel i think you are so cool
it was music we were making here until
if i can talk on television
hide your eyes hide your tears
my baby is fun had gone
more than a million roses bloom
i know you you do not need me
angels you have made your choice
and the stars in the sky
oh i have seen some things
i think i hear it laughing
his life was filled with parasites
i want to be a scholar
and his gun in his hand
the new police will find me soon
you know that i wo not be untrue
from new york to shanty town
or why has thou forsaken me?
for no reason but to touch
watch them out on the rocks
i am not looking for another as i wander in my time
just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
that little girl goes wading in
your eyes to a bright new dawn
and the bridge of death was crossed
as his past puts him back in atlantic city
prisoner of fate victim of circumstance
dog yearsit is the season of the itch
when i am on my own
the moon full of blood and light
and every time i thought i walk through walls
there is a tree where the doves go to die
do not set me free i am as helpless as can be
driven on without a moment to spend
i have seen you so often
and in my bed my lover her hair was midnight black
and he wears them in his face
or crossing the you s a
listen baby! listen to me baby! help me help me baby!
if you are this way again
but the delusion is feeling dangerous to me
your laws do not compel me now
some by sermon some by force
oh come on love stay with me
a tattooed breast and flaming eyes
feel it rising comatose with no fear of falling
and if things are going good
why do not you come on back to the war it is just beginning
baby what is on your mind?
the motorcade will be ten miles long
stay with them now for they wo not see you any more
i like the dirt that you dish
and he puts on his dark glasses
and you as i saw a piece in a jigsaw
all the things that you needed from me
the mississippi rises and widens the sea
she did not break the wall
but i am really in heaven
i used to wake up the ocean
oh and i am just waiting 'till the shine wears off
but even when i am grey
only love can steer you right
yeah my baby stayed out all night long all night long
will she walk through the flame
sing a song like what you said
a blond belief beyond beyond beyond
i am reeling in the music
but i swear i wo not touch you
and before we talk of any repentance
the air was magic when we played
do not think of the danger
show me the place where you want your slave to go
do you remember all of those pledges
and then it comes for me again
and i got it worse than you
that is where she kept on climbin' lord
dies to be part of the ground
i believe my little soul has grown
to get me to the heart of this
all they want is your purest sin
let me ask you one question
come back darling and put things right
running scared that you love him so
a girl my age went off her head hit some tiny children
and if we have only got this life
you might not wake up wear the make-up
as i search in and out above
if i could read your mind love
this house is far too cool
the arrow flies while you breathe the hours tick away - the cells tick away
am i just ca not last
but my heart is beating and my pulses start
they chase through the streets of manhattan
and might i say it seems so fitting in it is way
i look into your eyes and i know you wo not kill me
a while ago somewhere i do not know when
elvis is english and climbs the hills
what life without them would be
like leaving this room i am in
and i think my head is smoking
you might have to stay for awhile
told his woes to no man
we are not supposed to cry
and i have been putting out the fire with gasoline
she turns to see her brother again
and if the homework brings you down
and i die : you die
and i would get him to swap our places
on the screen there is an ape a gorilla
time is short i have an appointment at noon at noon in hell
and ol man river is got a bone to pick!
and every tear is a waterfall
but he wo not answer me
as privileged as a whorevictims in demand for public show
bring me my gun of itching desire
'cause you say you see straight through me do not you
that is the way i remember her best
andre has a red flag chiang ching is is blue
it is the darkest hour and your voice is new
take it in right take it in right right to your love life
the road he drives you down
they leave with mean black boots on
do not say it is over do not say we are done
i read about a man to whom i may be related
there is a field of green
to a man i have never known before
she was silent trying to be
there was peace with no trouble at all
but you pay me no attention do you
she ca not have it all
and with each beam the same old dream
like a cat dragged in from the rain
or will i always be here
traveling light like we used to do
well it is been so long so long so long
hold on to anyone hold on to anyone
take my advice or you will curse the day
he coughed and shook his crumpled wings
i can feel the voltage from her fingertips
i ai not no millionaires son no no
what a moon? coming like a headlight through the window
i i can remember i remember
this girl is made of loneliness
oh i have been down so far
and let my body do the talking
we will be going down so deep
everything that you need is here
she is strong and she is soft
that will not help the poor one
have you left a seat for me?
so look out below i am falling now
a world that ought to be
singing deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
softly she spoke these words to me
if just once i could feel love stare back at me
we are watching the world pass us by
the boatman calls from the lake
do not leave me waiting here
like a zippo smokes the way
and we sleep the devil is sleep
with the sweep of my hand
spent his time in the picture house
it just takes a while to travel
i press my hands to my ears
when a colorful rag is unfurled
and i strap the stick on my back
he is a very good friend of mine
to watch the news on tv
all sucking from my crazy mind
you feel there is something calling you
it is all lost to me now
now i am caught on your line
i felt so good i could not feel a thing
all the love we should have given
back of the roadhouse we got the bungalows
and she steps on the moon
she believed in me her soul plus my arms
falling on a child is grave
oh i had a wonderful diehood thanks to my fa fa family
yes i am almost done x
i am a patriot and i love my country
i got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
by the loss of one he could not replace
he would wake up wash and pour himself into uniform
'tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue
i even shun the south of france
i tried to unravel the mystery of jesus christ the saviour
there is a sailor who sings
i heard of a saint who had loved you i studied all night in his school
foi na cruz foi na cruz
what are you trying to prove?
cut on runway number nine big  set to go
once there was a friend of mine
stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
we are walking down the street
when you reach the top get ready to drop
do not leave me do not leave me here
you searched for me all among
and baby i oh baby i
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
then the cuts can seem too cruel
and she is hooked to the silver screen
i do not have faith in faith
fans the flicker to a flame
and all you ever wanted to be
maybe we are lying then you better not stay
we teach old hearts to break
he hit me with a surprise left
oh if you climb a mountain and turn around
if the black had not a-pulled her off i think she would have killed them
was i was i only limping was i really lame?
stood on a bridge tied to the noose
there is no place that i belong
except what we forgot to do
please do not turn me off
even the stars look brighter tonight
it is funny how even now you are miles away
si tu vois mon pays if you see my country
not a chance so i have to turn to you
and feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me
but then he never stopped tryin'
we flew done here just to figure you
and standin like this with my ear to the ceiling
you do not need no crystal ball
now i have drunk a lot of wine
i ca not dance and i ca not sing
to cease on a reason for this mad mad season
you can run but you cannot hide
and i am falling down again
judy i hear the children calling
he do not like to talk
like a machine in the park
for it is a clear and easy pleasure
and your howling at the moon
made out like a bandit for so many years
i borrowed a traveller is glass
take a naked root for a lovers seat
oh he love he love he love
we could do all the good things
i do not know how the river got so wide
i do not fit in too well
now your watching is over you must play with girls and boys
will you lead me to your armchair
i ca not pass this time of day
and then taking from his wallet
i said take me back i have changed my mind
someone to stick my hook in
and the archer split the tree
look around you will see who is laughin' last
they bring me the bottles empty
no resistance no alarms please this is just too good to be gone
you are living for nothing now i hope you are keeping some kind of record
unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun
where do i gowhere do i stay
the crimson snow falls all about
and i have not got a penny
passionate bright young things takes him away to war - do not fake it
they will trample on the grass
i am guided by this birthmark on my skin
and our love become a funeral pyre
and it comes to you he never was a stranger
your sister fingers burned like iodine
when life makes you feel small
about my life and her drinking to you too
we are so small between the stars so large against the sky
there is blood on every bracelet
his board is always full of dings
it is too quiet in here and i am beginning to freeze
when april is in may oh uh oh
to a place where your troubles ca not find you
carving her way through the dance floor
and he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
banjos playing through the broken glass
confined to sex we pressed against
but it flew away from her reach
all i ever wanted was someone who looked like you you oh
all these reaching hands out grabbin' things grabbin' me
for you to speak to me
'cause you use your heart as a weapon
wish you could pull me up
it seems it ca not be true
in the golden light of autumn
we twist the world and ride the wind
he ai not what he seems
oh but it hurts me it hurts me
well its five in the morning
and meet me across the river
i know i am more than just a number
the love you are always yeah
i turned back home i turned back home
they told us all they wanted
may your day be bright as the eyes
and she looks so beautiful in her armor
do you want to be the moonlight in his cave?
there are colors on the streetred white and blue
i know the falls that the water face
like friends to help you out when things go wrong
because i made you think for it
i am waiting for an angel from my dreams
like a leaf in the fall
i got my time machine got my little 'lectronic dream
but ca not knock my door down
can you see her little eyes?
ii miss you already yeahi miss you always
i will show you how with fire
i went to the crossroads fell down on my knees
he danced a jig with a crook-backed flea
some see life as a broken promise
now we are stopping the world stopping it in it is tracks
or will i be seeing you soon?
she looked around and earth was gone
have we been in love forever?
high up above or down below
sail on sail on sail on sail on
i ca not close my eyes
i will steal a cricket bat
is there someone there to reach me?
just remember that death is not the end
it is been a long time coming
standing in the light of love
just as i tell you here
everybody knows that the captain lied
take my switch at the bitch in my house
there is a man behind those eyes
time makes it easy but you
or just a form of modern art
but i want to reach out and tell you
see what it is we lack
where your mouth had a thousand reviews
while others see only the worst
two by two they are walking by
the conspiracy is nowhere beyond our greatest self-destructive endeavor
what a jolly boring thing to do
the fire give up to the sun
i shut and locked the front door
i will be here with you
and other forms of boredom advertised as poetry
do not know who is gonna rip off who
poor old jim is white as a ghost
they want to welcome you in
introduced him to my loved one
will they marvel at the miracles i did perform
but i lingered on her thighs a fatal moment
the pavement is one huge crowd
our love could hold off cigarettes
that a lifetime ca not lose
that all my priests have passed
jump off a cliff do not need your help so back off
throws his nose to the sky
it was the end of love
and i ca not believe she cared
i said mother i am frightened
that when she came she would be coming just for me
you are a fool fool fool
it broke up into pieces and
it is gonna give you a chill
love will be the death of
just give her my message tell her of my plea
for even so i still remain your lover in captivity
and i will scatter them into the sea
you know she loves those long slow curves
i kiss you you are beautiful i want you to walk
and you were there to greet it
let me take you on a trip
now jesus he came in a vision
though i am dressed in rags i am richer
whatever you have planned for me
do you always know your name
the shout of the boys in the factory
and i bought a little cottage
look in look out look around --
i will kick the fuck out of you
and all i will never see
now i am over near the bandstand
i keep forgetting you do not love me no more
as you closed in in slow motion
with the promise of a man
these things have been known to get out of their wraps
barking at strangers and speaking in tongues
the leaves have fallen the men have gone
i hid you under my bed but they took you away
she soared up to the rafters
who is got the brain of jfk?
to make a handout worth a lot
and buy myself a big old car
get carried away on the songs and stories of vanished times
oh i beg i beg and plead singing
and the stars shall dance about you
she says you have got a minute left to fall in love
every time i think of what you pulled me through dear
you do not want to be famous you want to be shy
who set the standard born to be rich?
on another world by another star at another place and time
that girl in the mirror between you and me
we played our songs and felt the london sky
i am tired of trying to win and you are tired of me
no i still try to run on
standing in the light of your love
to our love send back all the letters
we left our kin and all our friends
they are riding on the subways
and there is little left of me
and he is lost the guardian heart
feels like there is something broken inside
and you think maybe you will trust him
at the house the door was wide open
well this little girl is so good to me little liza
got all these questions do not know who i could even ask
soon began to peak and pine
we hang on to every line
have you ideas on how this life ends?
can you see her little hands?
we all rearrange the same old song
skin tell me turn it around
the wind blew strong and cold
because one feels better than two
for i would been in the arms of my best friends wife
i am ice and dust i am sky
electrical changes are charging up the young
i look at what i have become
this bottle is not a prayer not a prayer in sight
but i still try to run on
and a punch in the belly
oh would i ever let you down no way
pictures of my face dissappear with time
cough up the bucks cough up the bucks
i have no tears in my eyes
in the back of a dream car twenty foot long
you wo not feel so good now that you have joined the gang
you owe me and i need you
everywhere you go baby you know you are never too far
oh i once was lost but now i am found
it do not matter how you worship
until monday morning feels another life
and i used to love the view
sometimes it feels like i could die
now crime is in syndication on tv
and the way that we feel
and i shake on the floor
everybody knows that you really do
when i wait up and wake up
the baby is crying so you do not go outside
take it in right take it in right
that things could so utterly alter?
it will no longer be necessary
hello minnie moony vicious vicious buddy holly sandy denny
you know love needs no disguise
and they are talking it to me
taking the high road taking that high road to the wounded city
may this once just skip a beat in memory of you
once you once you [repeat x]
we could dance dance dance through' the fire
gossip till their lips are bleeding
for still the fare of love is true
see the other one stumblin' on who can not see
and all his virtues burning in the smoky holocaust
and if our lives became too long would it add to our regret?
to live my life like anyone else
i looked in the mirror today
i ca not wait to share this new wonder
i am falling in a glasshouse
he said listen listen to me now
and prayer ca not travel so far these days
bang bang sun do not shine
and i like to always hearing you say you are liking it too
something he had not imagined being
but i am glad we talked
lose my way and fall again
against the laughter in the other
do not want to be a richer man
love is a game that we play
precipitation which side are you on?
and your laughing song it fades
a hundred thousand beams of light
the morning says the answer is yes
play a sad song for me
he could have tuned in tuned in
jump in the meusse and swim away
des pays etrangers in foreign lands
there is a high flyin' bird way up in the sky
but we did not even know
falling off the face of the earth
help me help yourself please want me to please let me to
you see you hear these funny voices
preachin' and a cryin' tell me that i am lyin' about a job
but should one refuse to come it does not subtract the sum
i struggle hard to take these pictures in but
she feels hard and she looks hard
like a smile in your heart
tu es tombe - you fell
locked up inside that box behind your door
it is a shame that his children disagree
she is quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
the love of a woman is a wonderful thing oh yeah
the doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
oh teachers are my lessons done?
he says call me back in a week or three
'cause she loves me too much
what made my life so wonderful?
you did not get to heaven but you oh oh
you start to move you take the floor
this wheel will be turning right then straight
i would make everything all right
see how the heart reaches out instinctively
with a prayer in the air i will leave it there
everybody seems to look your way now
he brushed the tear from my cheek
on days when the weather was fine
when one is gone and far
when you are sad and when you are lonely
and everybody knows that you are in trouble
this is what i could have been
a crystal layer of ice on our skin:
she is gone to heaven so i got to be good
take that smile off your face
it could have been if you would only lied
i met her in the first class lounge
if it is just inadvertent simulation a pattern in all mankind
made him want to be everywhere
it is just a question of time
through the night through the night
i might just stop wanting you
they are no help to basic needs
and sign it with a kiss
in the shadow i will clip your wings
think we are in for a big surprise
she is standing naked and apologizing
is it could have been worse
i have got the friend i need
i have caught your wings for laughs
lovers keep on the road you are on
well i know five years is a long time
as i bring the cup up to my lips
we are not ones for busting through walls
think about myself it happens to me
for though they may be parted
my loves have come my loves have gone
and i thank you i thank you for doing your duty
who in mortal chains who in power
well take that coat babe and throw it on the floor
you will never see a sign hanging on the wall
where do i gohow do i feel
they were freezing with the chills
like the tax-man come to call
then i ran into the hangman he said it is time to die
we live in a beautiful world
and i wo not tell you mine
says girls just wanna have fun
it is alright i will come 'round when you are not in
who feel that life is but a joke
that is holding on and on and on
the tipsy the reeling and the drop down pissed
and when i get that feeling
a tiger is waiting to be tamed singing
i said little girls play with the big disease
keep on rockin' in the free world x
i have seen it all before
ca not touch the bottom oh
oh but we sit up all night
and let your hair hang down
covers up i cast you offi will be watching as you breathe
bah dom bah cursing at the astronette
the price of what we are winning
i cannot raise my drink without stopping to think
in the sand there he stands upon the shore
the man with the child in his eyes
gonna be me it is gonna be me
evil heat is running through me
waitresses are cryin' in the rain
you throw a rock against the road
something is changing it is in your eyes
under everything just another human being aw huh
when she could not hold oh she folded
it lives without it lives within you
and drew him down to me so he could feel my breath
in the arms of other men
and she moves right up close to me
and when the ape rattled it is chain
i can recall the time we tried it that way
i have no fear but for falling down
and king of the mountain now
you think you are out of sight
you put it in your mouth
this city is an ogre squatting by the river
i am afraid that he left
up until one century ago there lived
blessed with the feeling we will break
the leaves have fallen the men have all gone home
and put me up on the angel is shoulders
and if we trust in our hearts
asylum people calling on my door
you smiled at me and said babe
do not really know who sent me
i love to see you smilin'
do we have to be forgiving at last?
and now the wheels of heaven stop
my name is nancy but here i am coleen
bury me on the lone prairie
well i went with mary lou
if we could get these things accomplished
i find it hard to place my face
i have stood upon my mountaintop
they say that the devil is a charming man
the ones we wish would hear us
heaven lies between your marbled thighs
if i was a skunk weed and you was a bee
and he threw it with an thunderous yell
well last night she kissed me but than death was upon her
it is lost in our embraces
i am stuck with a valuable friend
i will be calling you soon
we get the drunken and passionate pride
he said one world must come out of world war two ah the fool
i does not matter where i lie
the world is spinning madly it drifts in the dark
and may the spirit of this song
when i get home i am gunna clean up my house
face up hit the target or you better hit the ground
no matter who no matter when
the candle burning over your shoulder is throwing
you can sit by my side
as i pass a recreation ground
i have faith i will find
and even down looks up down looks up
all they ever wanted a little bit of you
in vain to search for honor
i think he is gone to stay
remember 'hey mister las vegas-you used to be so cool!'?
still contain the same old me
where sands sing in crimson red and rust
one two one two three four
buzz and alice d have shown
i will be sleeping by myself tonight
but that does not make a fool of me:
it is like we are back in the dark ages
where he had often been before
give up what you ca not defend
on top of a world forever churning
she thought she could never cope
and bring her back to me
what my life would seem to me
i want to talk but i have not got too much to say
ah they are soiled now they are torn at the edges
oh i close my eyes and wait for a sign
there is something i can do
the smell of victory land of the free olympic dream
a patience i ca not steal
the hedgehog will roll on the grapes on the ground
who remembers you when you are gone
i had to cram so many things to store everything in there
shell of the man from the sea
steely-eyed outside to hide the enemy within
i have never been so happy to be alive
and one hand on the handle
and he put his hand on mine
between the darkness and the stage
it is all about my car cough up the bucks cough up the bucks
you will have to guide me
but i have already been born once
do not try to reach out
that her tongue dare not name
should i ask her how she really feels
remember when the scenery started fading
that it grows darker with the day
fools try to wish it away
to laugh at how you break
i could walk away so proud
the ideal that i wanted to see
but it would only take a moment to
they coolly decide to sell him down the line
around the corner and over the hill
taken off the days one by one
in hope and loneliness she crossed the floor
i forget the insemination and for that i am supposed to be glad
and i love the way you tickle my chin
begging hands and bleeding hearts will
faces frozen in the frigid air
loves to cut you down to size
let all the boys and the girls
when your summer days come tumbling down
and welcome welcome cries a voice
and when you have seen what she is seen
give me back my broken night
waiting for rescue and i know you just
i am still confusing love with need
you hold your head up high
between a man and a woman
that what you fear the most
well i said i played some
when my cup is already overfilled
if the water is still flowing we can go for a swim
pray to me on dominion day'
of course you will say you ca not complain
l hold d this letter in my hand
now father you are dead and gone and i am finally free to be me
placing all the questions in the
open letter to the powers that be
the door is open - someone is calling: it is a woman
i am not asking for mercy
all the papers had to say
i will spare a little thought for the crow
i had to laugh not to cry
did you see them in the river?
and they whispered into your brain
the children come the children go
and macheath has got a knife
they think i am up to something weird
he gave me life without parole
i will be in my own dance and iiii
look for me when i am lost
well do it now do it now
put your little hand in mine
and when i awoke i believed i would taken a bride called mary stanford
though nothing will drive them away
you never told me of your other faces
if god is all they say
i catch him when i am bending
i think i see you standing outside
she said just do not disappoint me
just when you think she is yours
i will travel round the world one night
you will never see a sign stuck on the cash-box drawer
a pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick
out of the realm of the orchestra
they say knowledge is a dream yeah
inside of you can be two woman
well she is got it made
they arrived at an inconvenient time
just a shield of rusty wire
we can go from boom to bust
but he himself was broken long before the sky would open
now when we hit the road
like the music of the spheres
like that snow that fell looks so wrong and out of place
the end was begun it would hit everyone
the holy war was slowly building
just because it is over for you
all the evenings close like thisall these moments that i have
put your lies in a box
everybody is saying everything is alright
a lot of little girls go lost
not until i am ready for you
'cause i will have friday on my mind
you should be hard to be a brother
do you think i can change it in a day?
that old blue car we used to race
if we are so much the same like i always hear
there is a palace in the gravy
it may take a lot of time
that is another thing i like you for
well i know that you really loved him
like a tear in all we know
my room it looked the same
laughing out loud with fear and hope
the words i have to say
it seems to leave them partly blind
my face is all lit up
what i feel when i hesitate
although my home has been broken
running and hiding take and dividing
well i got a girl that is so good to me little liza
leave a message at least i
i never see how i am gone make it though on my own
i know that all things pass
i would rather be high i would rather be high
she we gave her most of our lives
and them downtown boys sure talk gritty
and i do not want to know your past
you left when i told you i was curious
and yawning rubbed the sleep away
that blue bird down the water
but i do not know how i know
the workin' man is in for a hell of a fight
i have no heart to lie
to know my heart better than me
if i could only reach that dial inside
but the spies hide out in every corner
the fire would sparkle in your eyes
when i was a child running in the night
and it is called a heart
oh look at the smile that cracks
i have made the human choice
and here i am again my girl
i placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made
they spun a web for me
but i ca not believe she is gone
it is curling just like smoke above his shoulder
hand on my face pushed to the ground
i was dreamin' when i wrote this
where still the sun must set
an angel led me when i was blind
to the forces of light and heat
i put it on when i go lonely
their vows are difficult they are for each other
i ca not turn the other cheek
a gentle hand a secret touch on the heart
stood upon the back streets and we start to play
they can buy but ca not put on my clothes
that is why i am doin' it my way
as a falling leaf may rest
got to walk out of here
if i only knew the answer
the screaming tires the busting glass
that i got the crossroad blues this mornin' lord baby i am sinkin' down
i will be yours yours for a song
surely by now i should know
i paid the price never held you in real life
and then there is friends of mine who must have sunlight
as so with that i thought i would take a final walk
and one eye filled with blueprints one eye filled with night
once upon a time we fell apart
a london boy oh a london boy
and fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his
she wanted to take it further
well it goes to st louis
i wanna touch you with my hands on your hips
i am trying to make it last
in chains i am in chains
i know that this is the way for me to go
it is over it is over
cannot seem to make the dots connect
take your pick leave yourself behind
and i am not gonna take it back
tell me we both matter do not we?
on that endless senseless demented drift
i hear the storm outside-first drop just hit the roof
i will be rockin' on the porch
on my fingers the smell of her deep black hair
i am grateful now they have left
can you? take it in right
i showed my heart to the doctor he said i would just have to quit
even richard nixon has got it
for you and me - we would elect each other president
to taste anew the fruits of life
hurt once and for all into silence
and we hope they are gonna last
you give me life please do not let me go please do not let me go
that god is in the house
muddy water taking back my home
i am just a rock star stabbing away
but the truth lies somewhere in the middle
i said do you feel it when you touch me
so make up your mind for me
if we are only members of the human race
and when you change a vote
where none was sick and none was well
on her hand she wore a plain gold ring
before the ground it gives way
between the sailboat and the drain
sit by my side come as close as the air
like a river to a raindrop i lost a friend
but for power and for greed
we are not invisible we are not meaningless
i was worried out of my mind
in the glory game on the power train
see the saviour of the human race
ah we are drinking and we are dancing
many times i have been alone
for i know there is something you must tell me
are you gettin' something out of this all encompassing trip?
and here you will stay never more to stray
i am looking for the treason that i knew in '
please be easy you got it i have not
and never know what is good for me
we could not have done it by ourselves
and the way things ought to be
oh baby just you shut your mouth
be it better late than never
and honey i know you will be there to relieve me
if your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
and he warned me not to stop him
i was living on the road
she had little chance to make good
i am dying for you just to touch me
did i ever tell you what happened before?
becomes a keen and bloody sword
it was a warm and very ferocious night
when you are dragged toward the hell-mouth
he said i am gonna buy this place and watch it fall
swear it on the moon and stars above
that all the good fuzz must
well the night was deep and the night was dark
a butcher a banker jack irons on drums
i feel hypnotized i feel paralyzed
i cannot stop the thoughti am running in the dark
there is no pain you are receding
every morning got sun to shine
up here in my tree yeah
i do not sit around and wait
she said this is not a love song
a name for one like me
have you ever had a dream or two?
do you believe in the word of god?
it was thunderin' it was lightenin'
yeah it makes a long time man feel bad
and i would been close once before
thousands of acres of forest are dying
the wheels just keep on turning
and your prayers they break the sky in two
yeah let is do something crazy
you can make a difference if you really try
then why do i feel alone?
the diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
and in my lover is ooh
put them in a big white sack
ten lonely days ten lonely nights
fix my meals and go away
i do not know if they can do it
looking pretty though but i still want to say
but they are not like tonight
left him nearly out of his mind
but his skin is just so fucking thick
i am so light the wind he shakes
bueno sera i wo not be long before we all walk off the wire
to make their point of view
well i love that kewpie doll
i am gonna take my problem
how you smile and pretend it is fun
i know you are hungry i can hear it in your voice
if i find a girl he will take her away
i am a seed wondering why it grows
oh try and mimic what is insane
and ah hear her crying too
i hate to see your pain
sometimes love breaks my heart [repeat: x]
like a rare and precious metal
oh is there concrete all around
she feeds him yeah that is why she will be back again
and just for a second i thought i remembered you
people buy the things they want
who knows who wrote that song of summer
and watched the world come undone
i am lost as screamers roll in
and my hands shake my head hurts
tears away with a mighty force
if you would be so kind
i have been sitting here since wednesday morning
put my hands up to the sky and it is alright
like the rest of the world
he used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
i guess that is why they call me
rush - blow up the street blow off the mad heat
and me i know just where you are you see
maybe i am just a ghost
it do not really matter where i am
some of us play but cry
may death be on your brow
she got a turned up nose
boys like me are not supposed to cry
said a joker to the thief
like slot machines that call it 'love love'
i know when i am lost
so i never say die aim never untrue
when he was poor he was sure
and you dare say it belongs to you to you
filling up the world with time turning time to flowers
all the innocents lost at one time
falls back down on his arse
the way that we treat em is a crying shame oh yeah
i want to breathe part of the seen
you tried to make me crawl far too soon
i swear i made every effort to be good to her
where the women kneel to pray
just one time around can be taken away
we may never find out what it means
from your hatred and from your love
the captain is free-hand is a clearer
mo tengoku no giyu no kaidan wa nai
my kind of love can only bring you joy i am gonna
i can see horses wading through snowdrifts
feel your arms are opening out
nobody dancing it was only make believe
and i would die for you
i go singing out of tune
so if you love someone you should let them know
share the rest of my life
to be insulted by these fascists - it is so degrading
that men will follow through your grace
it is what it is - and forever
see how it bleeds for you
there is nothing i would rather do
still there is a light i hold before me
i would really like to live beside you baby
there is no escape you see
i just would like to believe
but there is nothing really happening
flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud
get a bottle and push it on down'
and it is time for the burden
shifting land broken farms around me
i will take you under my wing
waiting for the world to end
for the seeds that we let grow
came apart and then writhed again
a memo to a higher office
i am gonna do what i should do
and the speed boats flying above
yeah i can hear your young
and that man you have now sure ai not one
this is a public service announcement
you can lay your burden down upon me
o o o then ya kno that lil girl would just have to go!
well he wanted to die and the only way to fly was to die
we need help but nobody is in sight
she is a hundred but she is wearing
now is the place where the crossroads meet
it was love at first sight
she is standing in the kitchen
i can take you places in a different way
cause he is always doing stupid things
i give you my i give you my
i hear you laugh i heard you sing
when all of those little things walked on by
each one is life a novel
they are leaving here yeah yeah yeah leaving here
oh and i hide my disappointment cause for years i have been hoping
it came back to haunt me and i realized
bring me my bullets and i will fire
swimming on a sea of faces
if you do not then lie lie to me
you know i will always help you baby but you know i just ca not do that
but then it touched my soul and said:
i would do it all again
they carried them to the flat lands
no we never die for long
when i get home i am gunna invite my brothers
light up the fireworks in me
cause you are my golden opportunity
her hair was fallin' down her shoulders
i hear you laugh as god abandons me
in some kind of a dream
it was only yesterday i went knocking on her door
and the fields they are under lock and key
like the map of some forbidden land
have i carved enough my lord?
there is nothing much to take
i will look for you if i am ever back this way
amongst the cogs and the wires my youth
do you hear my heart beating?
there is a sailor who eats
all we ever look for ooh la lune
i think it is time for us to recognize
it is the kind and leaves me alone
a mock sun blazed upon her head
i was diving i was diving
back in the country living on the double e
we are strong we run though
i have found the problem and the problem is 'one'
i suppose it is very shady
now i bid you farewell i do not know when i will be back
resurrect as a feeling on my window
you will catch your death in the fog
yes we are going down the lane
i think it is time we stop children what is that sound
pushing through the market square so many mothers sighing
something inside that was always denied for
and you will beyou are dippin' in your battleship
i will lend it to you will you treat it tenderly
the mighty wave their hankies from their
there is a feeling you give me an everglow
it is gonna hurt it is gonna hurt me bad?
all its teeth bared all its teeth bared
we let the children build temples for you
all the blossoms come sailing down
i know your day has been oh so long
talking bout a hands on policy
friends who never left your mind
they all have hills to fly them on except for lin tai yu
if the end is the same as tomorrow
trying to prove that you are better woman
me i am still smiling but i do not know why
and everything you are thinking babe inside your head
with the daylight in his eyes
lonely nest dear mother yes surely she is a work of art
put your wings on me wings on me
you can look into my eyes
lawyers and business you get what you bring
through a crack of light i was unable to find my way
she looks so beautiful with the top down
i stand without a word to say
for i have no head for wine
and me i am totally shipwrecked over her
meanwhile granny has got her bright colors on
one to love who allowed his in the hole
your coat was hanging in the hall your hat was in your hand
and then i find it out when i take a good look up
get unfunny! such as choirs do why the clocklock bought up this one
baby baby brush the dust of youth from your shoulder
this is my plea this is my need
though i live in slums i am purer than you my friend
what has not got my heart in it shall we be dubbed sir names
and the spears of bright sun
can you take it? feel me?
and i had to remain here
and he wondered oh how i am
saying we are juvenile deliquent wrecks
and it is me they are looking for
i set a course just east of lyra
heavied by the early morning dew
pray that you will stay away forever
you know i have hated that song for so long
from the marital bed to the psychiatric couch]
i will show you things to forget
and i did not make it back on time
there is so much that you can rise above
got to pull you close into me
stars winking through the canvas hood
it is my thing ah it is my favourite hygiene
there is a knock on the door
it is an addiction image of love
i do not need a reason
shower the people you love with love
still i call it magic when i am next to you
walk me to the corner our steps will always rhyme
you can lay your burden upon me
i hear you are feeling down
you are like two stars colliding
not asking for the ghost to call
for god is in the house
i think i am going bald
but you know he will find a cure
words of caress on their lips
through the black of your heart oh lord
folks have got to make choices
to the o of the host
i ca not wait 'til the morning
it sucked you in it dragged you down
and nothing can help me here
hope alone wo not remove the stains
i would put your leather boots on
i am drinking i am drinking
jazz police i hear you calling
i can fly i close my eyes and i can fly
yeah my heart is my gun army of one
and throw them in the lake
i have got everything i need
dust and the cloying yellow of polishing-cloth
and the other down your panties
so this is what it is like to be an adult
i have been waiting for you
but there is no one left to see
suck you dry suck suck you dry suck you dry
on one side the government the other the mob
this is the morning of our love
all the boys we got to get together
i will mourn with you by my grave
they know me better than that
i can feel my soul on fire
do not it make me smile? yeah
before you have had your fill
waltz do not you know that i would be really breakin-ing
a man could lose his way in a country like this ? canyons and cactus ?
so do not look down the ground is gone
we will meet again my love
the act of a noble warrior
their world was torn asunder into hollow hemispheres
got a sick sense of humor
though it is definitely not of me
and saw what was to come
and a little cocaine went a long long way
that i stand at the gates alone
under the marble and the snow
i feel the pressure like your eyes on me
on a different point of view
i bring you love and deeper understanding
take a lesson from these autumn leaves
more than working for the rich men poor man beggar
who is sitting next to me
and waiting for the world to come along
does not mean that much to me
i could not walk at all
but a lot goes on forever
and they wondered and were sad
if heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through
had my eyes peeled both wide open and i got a glimpse
but if i did well really what is it to you?
i told you baby once before
you do not need them anymore
they slap a death-writ on his door
oh and yesterday is gone forever and ever never
waiting for the rainbow is end
and i am gone through the crack in the past
there is no end to the lengths i will go to
it is in the way of my eyes
she clings around with all the boys who treat her like unwanted toys
with one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl
so deep i could never touch bottom
then all at once the chaos ceased
all their eyes trained on the street yo oh
where the people tried to kill me
i went lookin' for the dj is daughter
it is so hard to be a saint in the city
closer all the time closer all the time
i have come on a few years from my hollywood highs
it picks me up and makes me whole
and we lived an endless night
the rainy days always make me sad
i thought the past would last me
it is changing in the big sky now
onward! and onward! and onward i go
i held her hand but i do not hold it now
you gotta get behind the wheel
walking straight down the middle of it
i can learn to close my eyes
heard my truth turn to lies
businessmen they drink my wine ploughmen dig my earth
ooh ooh what do we do
oh lucy look what you are doing i am doing it too
it is only when i lose myself in someone else
the disco the office the pub
they ask who is been blessed tonight i am
and who is it that you are always
there is still a heart that is beating
it is better to burn out
that is why i am searching
drowned by the cheer from the shore
your face is hidden and were out of sight
yet you know i have had the feeling
just a whisper in a puff of smoke
learns to live as if each step was the end
oh would i ever let you down okay?
you know i will never lose you baby abuse you baby use you baby
all the things that i should have given
do not do that to me darling
past the flags of freedom flyin'
if you try walking in my shoes
babe can you hear me now?
this is the time of our great undoing
the rustle of your falling gown
i just ca not deal with this
there ai not nothing we can do to protect you
do not follow the lines that been laid before
i am not quite sure what we are supposed to do
no man loved like i love you
who would be elsewhere if they could
seasons may change weather blows but you still leave a mark on me
sadly or in the depths of winter
they are working us like dogs around here
it is like his thoughts are too big for his size
i was walking with my girlfriend
but looking at you i wonder if that is true
the memory of the night before
above the clouds the moon was climbing higher
and now we have seen what price peace of mind
well i am a prisoner here yes but i am also free
and the next it is falling in on me
i make like i am a little deer
ai not had a job for a year or more and i do not know a thing - dig everything
i am talking 'bout skin games
it is not worth singing that same sad song [x]
he said he would fish me out of the moon
it is ok it is ok
he saw that his brother had sworn on the wall
you say it is a little but i am sure it is ok
but i do not like steven
shine on the grave of man
and i call to you i call to you
some kind of drama live on satellite
this is the place to be
so i think i will just act bored instead
i lie awake with my secrets
while sorrows pile up around you
who can give them back their lives
a traditional song which was a likely inspiration for the train song
for you i will always be waiting
they give you this but you pay for that
burning up each others' love burning up our lives
in my mind there is a clearing
i feel my heart start beating to my favourite song
fell it rising yea next stop falling
the waters going down it is a mighty tight squeeze
no-one stops to help they are far too busy
with snorting head he gazes to the shore
i took my love down to violet hill
oh oh did i say that i want you?
the door it opened just a crack but love was shrewed and bold
the crumbs of love that you offer me
i would rather dance my life away
said leave your lady on the cement floor
shall we leave this place now dear?
on the corner of a bed
they are gonna take me down
like the last one who cared
we do not live here any more
and the most beautiful words i could ever say
your guns are drunk and smoking
the struggle of the ancients first began
nothing to lose maybe i had something to trade
i swallow my face just to keep from biting
we are living in a world full of illusion
i do not know why i come here
and i cleaned and i cleaned
it is it is the love draw nearer
so you see i am not naive
the only story i ever knew or cared for
no grave marks our love for you
oh she leaned over the bed and with the lips above my head
something is falling from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me
i can hear the pounding of her heart
ooh you want to get it right sometimes
and i called for me a bed
you whisper you have loved enough
a lil' kindness to go a long way
do not say the words you might regret
but if crying and holding on
i went up on the mountain looked as far as i could see
and it took off down a trail
look at me look at you
you have got to take this moment
memories to look back on people i have been
we would sit and talk of dreams all night
and if you do not then lie lie to me
who for his greed who for his hunger
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again
there is a door in the house
i have got something for you
and tear out the soul of god
we sleep with machines that breathe
you see i am really not a human at all
and just a whisper a whisper a whisper a whisper
love is a game and you lose
rock and roll can never die
driven in --- driven to the edge
a wheel of fate a game of chance
cause she will break your heart one day and she will laugh as she walks away
i journey down the hundred steps
i am burning up the road
we are gonna be laughing about this
says it is a stupid thing to do
like a swallow flying to malta
they are drowning you in compliments
like i see through the water that runs down my drain
all hail the lucky ones i refer to those in love yeah
i have never felt so disappointed
we had a friend a talking man
what can i do what can i say
well i lost my job thinkin' about you
but the rose i sickened with a scarlet fever
and at night we are on our knees
but you have done me some wrong
and i can not be saved
land of beauty space and light
oh do not talk to me
uh uh no come on! you say
daddy is out the back with little joe
and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
still it is such a beautiful night
stiff as wire her lungs on fire
and come on rage with me
and it hurt just a little bit when they sliced and packaged it
in the hot dry rasp of the devil winds
little white shadows sparkle and glisten
now the sky could be blue
leads to blood in the streets
he is lost to the fourth
a couple of drinks on the house an' he was
we would roll and fall in green
he sings fa fa fa fa fa
the beds are made the table is laid
the world is ready for a whole new game
if there is no one in control
and i have just run out of fuel
just the shrieks from the old rich
for they passed a noble law
gonna heal this wound i am speaking of
and i keep on shoveling keep on shoveling keep on shoveling
world of the unlikely and bizarre
well you say you have been try'n'
i do believe it is working good
and that times change oh that times change
we are the end of the line
they are all bought and paid for anyway
still huck he ventures on whistling
oh christmas lights keep shining on
i am so much in love
and the magic music makes your morning mood
sleep the night 'til morning is dew
puzzled at why she still squirmed
chase the wind around the world
do not try to solve the puzzle
i have got to tear it down
there are ways i know we would mend
never knowin' if we would see the light
i sleep beneath the golden hill
you gave too much and you got nothing
you ca not melt it down in the rain [repeats]
after all that we have been through
i am gonna make it somehow
calm and grinning with a vanishing face
try to find peace of mind
'cause i dig everything -dig everything
and her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
and when the hunger for your touch
and it is holding the night in its arms
spin the grail spin the drug
i have never touched someone so cold
oh what have you done oh what have you done
what you do is your own glory
i gotta land with my feet on the ground
from the bloody cross on top of calvary
you cannot stand what i have become
somehow it just seems to fit
where her head and all its black hair did rest
to attack the very thing you are defending
richard slade carried in her old suitcase
oh who would ever want to be king?
i will bleed like holy rain
got a lion in my pocket mama say party
well i am gonna see my friend i am gonna see my friend for what i require
lock my door i only think in black and white
we broke the ruptured structure built of age
i want to be hear i am not there
i have seen this man before
the focus is sharp in the city
in the darkness of my night
you make yourself a nervous wreck
why do not you take it? why do not you take it?
cruisin' by the bars and honky-tonks where she met grandpa
they tell me i can go
but i have to deal with envy
it is a broken kind of feeling
whoah the human chain leaves a bloody stain
and they walk in twos or threes or more
oh yes it is the constellation of the heart
i do not have time to talk that fast
there is still a chance that they will see
when you are begging for a crumb
she plugged him through and through
i bet you laugh out loud at me
a maid a man needs a maid
you are always wishing and never here at home
when it seems you ai not got a friend
like the dolphins like dolphins can swim
i ca not fine the reason
oh lay down your arms and love me peacefully yeah
oh when you are still waiting for the snow to fall
and the clouds burst to show daylight
i hear that you are building your little house deep in the desert
now my life was like a river
you come walking into this room
shine a light through an open door
yes and jane came by with a lock of your hair
and when he laid eyes on her
but i still get this feeling
coz' we do not move the way they do
three beeps means trouble is coming
making the hot cocks in the flophouse bleed
she is got no money honey
it looked just like you just like you in every way
where he comes up with that stuff
dance me to the children who are asking to be born
and the shame was on the other side
sorrow has it is natural end
they say a suntan never fails
why move around the world when eden was so near?
though my views may be wrong
when i am not this hunchback that you see
with fear and filth and cowardice and shame
please make sure we get tomorrow
but to stay just would not be right
you might be a big fish
though his mind is not for rent
i need your loving i need your loving
i come to you and see all this ruin
i must do what i have been told
found a love that is true babe
then there is no price to pay
o little girl the truth would be
not the faulty units in this mad machinery?
it feels so good to see the smiles of
but it is becoming a lie
oh no the cry of a newborn child
he will make such a perfect prize
as you walk through the light
i wait for the coming day
oh i wanna talk to you
i feel my heart underneath my skin
you could have been anyone is dream
that falls all in love with you and expects you to be true
and the chaos is calling me
and they hide they hide in the world
the sunlight comes streaming through the holes
touch we touched the very soul
nothing back there for you to find
i wonder when oh when will it end?
i did not even think that you would accept
all the static in my attic a
you really think of me - alright
'cause my love baby is the truest you have ever had
i am a dead man walking dead man walking dead man walking
look out for the annihilation gun
you are always in my head
waiting for the phone to ring
pass the blood factory and the town
oh there will be an answer let it be
time we best begin here at the end end
she said i see your eyes are dead
i do not want to be
i saw it well i would shut the people out of my life
hello wo not you let me know?
there is a feeling of contentment now that you are here
one more weekend of lights and evening faces
when something is wrong i feel uneasy
and though each one of us are want to duly mourn
i have no room to spare
i do not want to lose the good thing that i have got
i do not care anyway i never lose
how much love did you spend?
skidding down a road of black ice
well i am goin' i am goin'
like this feeling you found like this feeling you found
you almost ca not stand it
you are always first on the line
i feel you coursing through my blood
when a family ca not survive
that i am a little crazy
i have lived a life as full
waves that crash on the shoreline
i think at last i understand
everything was almost perfect everything fell into place
lifetimes are catching up with me
i know what you will say
at coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
i have become so tired of this loneliness
take the rugged sunny days the warm and rocky weather
and words that she does not say
i am the word and the law
rise up and brace your troops for the attack
oh i never can say goodbye
but this ai not the movies so to hell with me
no i have not been to oxford town
and this is how you repay me?
rain your kisses down in storms
what it is like down here
i try do not blame me
so bring it on bring it on
she is so good with excuses and incorrect reasons
but i do not know how to stop
it creeps beneath your crawling skin
that they are building on some endless river
i know the sun must set to rise
to wash my eyelids in the rain
i set the wheels in motion
i have got icicles hanging from my knees
no his mind is not for rent
what makes me take from me
i can get on the telephone and call you up baby
oh yeah it rolled me right along
jump steady black betty bam-e-lam x
i asked you if a man could be forgiven
i ca not conceal what i feel what i know is real
here is a song from the wrong side of town
one day she stiffenedtook the other side
there were few at the scene but they all agreed
i said this ca not be me
i think of our old friends
i have read the poets and the analysts
lift that baby right up off the ground
i have never felt this way before
do not wanna have to lose you baby
yeah these are things that i do not understand
with a smile you would reply
it makes me want to give up
i do not even know the name
maybe i will stay tonight - so so
but it is not the truth today
you say that all your life
from the start in your own way
they have taken your innocence and then they throw them on a burning fire
than just some grateful faithful woman is favorite singing millionaire
never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed
you would know it if i had that shit do not come off
who knows he is been convicted who knows he will be shot
with no single memory of pain
sprawling on the fringes of the city
i think it is time we stop hey what is that sound
of my need to not disappear
i wonder if i will miss the pain
that sails to me across the line
yeah i do not wanna hurt there is so much in this world
i awake to see that no one is free
keep looking up for the ladder
i want you i want you i want you
once upon a time i could love you
born on third thinks he got a triple
still love is only a dream
we would go underneath the arches where the witches are in the saying
if you should ever track me down
i am what i am and you you are my only son
that are not addressed nor listened to
people lookin' for the horseshoe man
but this world is an accident
so we are dancing close the band is playing stardust
'cause they are free of thoughts unpure [sic]
sixteen candles burn in her mind
now you wo not say goodbye
away away we are sad to say
with all the things i ca not explain
she would run wildly through the streets
and i believe in faith and magic
you dressed in black and white you lost in the mall
i was born like this i had no choice
like the rat in a maze who says
you know that is not my style
that show me 'the light' jesus
and you need to test your will
so on battlefields from here to barcelona
you know there is something wrong
once inside i am out of my mind yeah
from the caverns of the heart
someone to shame us some brave apollo
i knew that i could never even the score
and i wo not let you do
and the rivers shall open for the righteous someday
as you have been moving surely toward me
i was lyin' in a burned out basement
you are not gonna give up
and then i confess that i tortured the dress that you wore for the world to
you are the one that i wanted to find
i do not watch channel  or  or
and some of us wo not
you are hung up on age
a thunderous roar shakes the air
and children plagued his latter life
some pretty little girl in cornersville
it sure makes a long time man feel bad
back home they would call me dirty
well now you are only fifteen
there is so much that i do not know
all the innocence lost at one time
fame fame lets him loose hard to swallow
no one gets to their heaven
you ai not worth the blood that runs through your veins
must be the one whose magic touch
especially when she came and spread her wings
do not you know that it is true
i sang you all my sorrows
let the love of truth shine clear sensibility
held in your arms in the back seat
but the boss do not like these dizzy heights
tripped with a quarter mile to go
that is smashed the cosmic model that blinded every view
i die with him again and again
that is all i ever do
maybe you will be coming back 'cause i am still waiting
this is the time that i will come running
but here we are we have come to call you home
why things do not always turn out as you plan
i ca not get down and i sha not get down
there is a lot to be said for nowhere
poor me i am floating out to sea
standing alone at the top of the stairs
i know you need your sleep now
you let it slip you let it slip
she lies and says she still loves him ca not find a better man
and every night little girl sadie would take all her clothes off and wind up
and your heart is hard and hateful
the chariots of angels are colliding
leads me by the hand to infinity
two green beans and a black-eyed pea
just tell me you love me
at the window through the glass
he was luckier than most men
they tied me to this table right here
your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
he sleeps with his clothes on
i know you think you are awful square
i am alone in my room and i am scared of it
distant as a comet or a constellation
o but your trial is yet to come
heard the whistle blowin' could not see the train
so throw a dollar onto the bar
maybe now we can show the world
there will print informative six-page features
until she breaks down into my arms like a
how much bad luck came your way
and baby i ca not hold it much longer
she had a new way of living
i have never touched something so old
and we do not have a song
i know then i do not
i hang my head and cry cry cry
my love my love what have you seen?
there is a place where we belong
i mean the places where we live
lie down and take a nap
hide what you have to hide
every time you would pass me by you would take a bite of me
we must have missed a turn
i need love love love love love yeah!
for the maples want more sunlight
your sun glassed protectors they do that to you
for i am sick of love
someone points to this and someone points to that
the smell of you still on my hands
your servant here he has been told
and pieces that do not fit how can anybody be enlightened?
so i moved like a rumour
get up early just to watch the sunrise
he is a ghost he is a god
so go tell the man that collects the dues
when you have got a secret then you have got to keep it
the shame the disgrace and the brutality
when uncle rat gave his consent
tattooed evil across it is brother is fist
the way i used to be
cause she once was a true love of mine
do you ever get the feeling
ah but do not go home with your hard-on
you will see him in your dreams
now the night bore down upon us all
so she will come back for me
sometimes i do not blame them
heaven bound on the wings of love
about obsessions with boys on the floor
so you will never see on the visiting-room wall
now i have got that feeling once again
taken over but it is trying
little fish swim between my legs
as we soar walls every siren is a symphony
though the rain and the sun come through
and just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
the maestro says it is mozart
i am takin all i got
feel your warm hand walking around
when the breeze blew through this construction
no wonder we get a little loud
and the down of a peach says mmh yes
say that i am a fool
write it just for me yeah
hey look at me go look at me
you caught yourself a trick down
and on every street corner you hear
od receiver i am all you crave
great cracks appear in the pavement
and it is partner found it is partner lost
walking the streets in the rain
call a doctor call a priest
leaves you junk sick and lonely
i heard a scream of a desperate kind
you got it so it goes
where do you think you are going so fast
we make a little history baby
they say the oaks are just too lofty
why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
the cleaners have done their job on you
i have been around flying baby there is nothing i would not do
his mother starts to call him
so modern day i walk my way my jacket faded
i let them see my soul that day
a tear in the heat of the art
because i murdered that knoxville girl
set up shop set off the whole block
do not you want to see it come down
the past has no claim on me
then one day that old man he up and he died
i said now you are out what are you going to do?
but when they sleep i sing and dance
think i have been here before
and in my mind i still need a place to go
i oh i oh i got me feeling drunk and high
i am hanging in there do not you see
but these things can still be given
i am a thinker not a talker
we have waited for too long
in your search for higher love
i am a good girl sir she said to him
givin' everyone to console their aching heart
of my innocencegot back my innocence
because my country is all i know
when i get home i am gunna cook her some dinner
i began thinkin' about our wedding day
you ca not make mistakes with babies
but i know just how he feels
nothing is happened in a million years
cause there is nothing i need
it is just not your day
and pushed the hair out of her eyes
not for just a year but always
music made for pleasure music made to thrill
lead right up to the sea
so he walked through the rain and he walked through the
come take him by his feet
in unlucky rows up to the gates of the garden
can you see the lark ascending?
sometimes i stumble when my mind is made up
gonna take a ride so far
one with the ocean and the woman unfurled
i am so tired of this
ooh it gets dark! it gets lonely
good god was it really yesterday?
never bored so i will never get old
i ca not stand this emotional violence
she is got a liquid-crystal compass
do not call me daughter not fit to
time to take leave all formal functions
are you headed for the country?
and we all know there is a war coming
there is a brand new talk but it is not very clear
i do not know which way i have come
oh in his last breath believing
put that baby is spell on me
raise the stakes then bring 'em down
you have got magic in your hands
and i have said before that i know you have too
protected her king from the sun rays of dawn
il y a un homme la dans les yeux
and they will bathe their feet in oil
always makes me happy when you are taking a chance
you hold my hand buff up my hair
i was hidden dem hiding all away
they are the ones that i would choose
to avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory
that do not change the way i feel
now i believe in nothing but the pain
the treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect
hard as a statue black as a tattoo ?
that is all i can say
and a woman cannot follow him
angels you ca not do this
show me the place i have forgotten i do not know
the minds that made us strong
white cane lying in a gutter in the lane
the shrieking of nothing is killing
he will never make the 'sweeney'
for i have seen your face
at the time it went over my head
you know i will always help you baby
he came dancing across the water
come on boys let her go
i am busy chasing up my demon
i am a man of flesh and bone
so they walked and they talked until they came upon a cave
our future still looks brighter than our past
after breakfast everyday she throws the want ads right my way
to her the hunted not the hunter?
picture the man when the heartbeat stops
and as the sun rise stream
but this time i think i mean it for sure
i said how come the men here suffer like they do?
he floated back down 'cause he wanted to share
yeah i am a lucky man to count on both hands
you can take a picture of something you see
no-one can blame us but you
but you make me forget so very much
i have to make you see
and feel your body relax on mine
i did not want to let them see me weak
come the morning i could swear you are next to me
why do not you try to live alone?
and the sky a greenish tan
i was sittin' on the bank with my mouth open
everybody look what is going down
come to cover the muck up
they sat a while in silence
me i figure as each breath goes by
the place with the chapel on th avenue and th street
she pointed at the bedroom door and said i ai not going in there
the thing that i have become
there is no reason for you to hide
like an angel i will move the arrow
as we come in the back door
you are released but your custody calls
with a host of holy horrors
if you play that fucking thing down here
it ai not a privilege to be on tv
should be a dream but i am not sleepy
and put a smile upon your face
pound the streets with marching feet
stumble as it is crumbling out of reach
the star that would not die
democracy is coming to the usa
then they cut to the announcer
i am rolling out of the ferris wheel
i like the funny feelings when i am with you
mystic rhythms -- capture my thoughts
born in slumber less than peace
she used to wear her hair like you
i will trade new dreams for old
now that may all be very well
do you wonder if we could find us from here?
to forgive all the things that i have done
send in thoughts of john the god
today is a brand new day yes it is
i touched you once too often
they will sound a fluegelhorn lay me low
facist cries both black and white who is got the blood who is got the gun
i never thought you never thought you
today is the day our younger son
and i know that i ca not leave
and i thought of ma and i wanted to get back there
so please just send in the machines
one flash of light but no smoking pistol
where you are dancing on your grave
well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
feel like a question is forming
everybody seems to look your way
by those who could not choose
which he fashions his beard'n'he rations his jerkey!
and i wo not tell you mine
is magnified by the things i have done
i will do anything i can
and when you are feeling low
so now it is really up to you
is it censorship? no it is evaporation
and who will aim the arrow
in the crowd stands mack the knife
keeps a knocking on your front door
where a million passin feet have trod before me
we thought it would be so hard
it is been a long time waiting
but darker is my day yeah
i have had enough of reading things
i bring wit and wisdom fair
confused alarms of struggle and flight
caught in the fire say oh
you can see it you can taste it
she is uncertain if she likes him got got do aaah aah aah
got a bag of frozen peas
and i did not know what to do
who sees you as something as more than sexual
then flow through the streets of the city
i do not want to be an angel just a little bit evil
down on myself in every way
my hand is bleeding i run back inside
they are going to catch us where we sleep
and a funny old crib on which the paint wo not dry
she came to visit lost and lonely me
and the birds do not even whisper
i waved to my neighbor my neighbor waved to me
there is a war between the rich and poor
you know i should forget you
show me the way lord 'cause i i am about to explode
and you are a private line
the sun goes down behind a veil
the pictures that give pleasure to your eyes
and she walks across the sea
it is coming to america first
now i am wiser than dreams
the mermaids sun themselves out on the rocks
there is nothing here but us
and threw it in the fire
and i slip my hand between the thighs of john finn is wife
do not wanna end up on your own?
saw her again in a magazine
i follow my father is trade
and she will hear that phone keep right on ringing and ringing
are we the only human beings to survive?
he is the real real thing
the world is so loud keep falling and i will find you
welli call out to the warden to hear my plea
where is michael? where is mark?
i know that this will never be mine
and all the things you do
life is a pop of the cherry
she cried to me hey why not ask for more?
if you say run i will run with you
as fires will sometimes burn cold
and why is it raining so? it is so cold
he got up outta there ran for hundreds of miles
it keeps me safe but oh! the sickly perfume
save our city save this city right now hey
do not be afraid it is only me hoping for a little romance
to such a very hopeless voice
good god oh my i cry
so he started up the mountain
all the clerks and the tailors
and never read a single word
things that decay things that rust
do not give up by peter gabriel with kate bush
'wo not you lend me some time?
i see god come in my garden but i do not know what he said
the blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
at the whispering stream at the bubbling brook
when you lose something you ca not replace
when the entire planet prepares for destruction
holding on with all my might
i tried to love you my way
and i do not know when
as if moved by sleight of hand
the line the god throws down to you and me
hoping their dreams will bring her back it is sad
i feel the way that you would
ai not it the truth now baby
i would walk away like a movie star
it all came out the wrong way
and the dealer wants you thinking
perhaps the strange ones in the dome
all i want to do is see you again
i can make it that far
into smoke i am turned and rise following them up
when you are head over heels and the magic is there but impossible
and look in each others eyes
it is a it is a it is a drive in saturday
them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
keep telling us we are to have fun
straight in the arms of the city goes huck
but the spies came out of the water
'cause stag put four holes in his motherfucking head
do not gimme no lip you have gotta face this shit
going deep south go down mmh yes
there is nothing more you can do
when the dragons grow too mighty
oh but you been feelin' long
when we lift the covers from our feelings
if you believe in love at first sight
the old-frame house she ca not take-a one more beating
it would break my heart in two
when you reach the part where the heartaches
down upon my face ah catch'em in my mouth!
from the ashes of the gay:
the punches came fast and hard
when they say i am things i am not
now you see how down you have fallen
cover up your face with soap there
no gifts of money do we give
or was he moved sleight of hand?
saying dead into belly and death into shoulder
pools of sorrow waves of joy
that novenber night looking up into the sky
would stop to pick up a rained-out leaf
if you see him in the subway
and i will let you be friends with mine'
remember that everybody has to wait in line
are ringing through my opened ears
they will be laughing and singing and music swinging
me and my shadow are so in despair
who would have ever thought of it
she took his much admired oriental frame of mind
i need protection from the likes of you
there is nothing i can say
then took me in his arms
i am out here kickin with the band
yes i am right with you
whoa this old world keeps spinnin' round
flashed and i think i am fallin' down
blew down the doors to let me in
for a boy of no means
take it down take it down
the sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow is denied
and there is nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
and the worst it has come true
and lost among the subway crowds i try to catch your eye
so i will wait until we are sane
it is more than i would try to do
a tiny little seed is sown
or would you like to pay
seems i have misplaced my desires
and so it comes to this
i could have been a princess you would be a king
he says 'it is all too dark'
in the dreams of a desert thirst
got to try and fill the void
when the dark clouds hung above
at the top of the hill
i will take more than another riverful
take a bottle drink it down pass it around
there is a hole in your soul like an animal
baby likes to go outside so i let her
and far away will be my home
they danced and lived as brothers
the place that i was born on the lakeside
and your death will come soon
of mad john finn i took his wretched life
these are the final days this is the darkness this is the flood
if the girl that you dreamed of last night
there is something very real in how i feel honey
you that fasten all the trigger
when you try to bring our spirit home
we ca not let our hero die alone
tears come streaming down your face
i might pick up a pen scribble on a page
you are like a sailor with a girl on every shore
and the fewer who do not even care
but now it is come to distances and both of us must try
and i will be there again
i know what that is about
she is leaving home bye bye
do not cry no tears around me
if our goals are all the same
i lost beforeyou know i ca not forget
he would rescue it mmh yes
to get up and go the distance
love is not enough in itself
just let me know if i sing too much
i wish i was back in the saddle now
i thought i would be rewarded
lights go out stars come down
when i am listening to you
brother if you need me near
said edith as she filled his cup
you set a course that you could not run
did i ever tell this has happened before?
where only those in pain go?
i hear you whisper like an open grave
and now we have the possibility
you would been to the station to meet every train
workin' them angels workin' them angels
so tonight i am gonna party like it is
but i was born in ontario ontario
like a ball that is spinning
i would tune into some friendly voices
i am not asking for the world to end
i would like to blow on your horn
tell them this world is full of danger
you know i am the same
so you have got power over me
if you get hip to this kind of trip
many men have loved the bells
do not stop and do not touch!
and why am i never gonna sleep again?
the love he receives is the love that is saved
'cause there is very few of us left
nor the dreamer in his cell
where did all the cash flow
this time i know it is gone
when so many love you is it the same?
yeah i knelt and emptied the mouths of every plug around
from the windows they were watching
your cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
model role model roll some models in blood
one by one the guests arrive
oh yeah i need your love
well it is been so long
and we are gonna have a party
but it is written in the scriptures
but we will be around some more
the judge he said: son what is your alibi
in these seconds just remain unchanged
a wild world figuring out the answers
and if you were to ask me
i am a child of this age
nuclear detours fall pass the right human hand
and my girl never fails to say if there is any work for me
everyone has a right to that
there are many ways a man can serve his time
get is colder day by day i miss you
if your mother do not love you then the riverbed might
when you know that you are not sure
i will be your operator baby
and when i get to shore i hope that i can kill good
we will never have to lose it again
and now i am swingin' and here i gooooooooo
is my education who i am now?
in the air there is a feeling of christmas
this is such a happening tailpipe of a party
you can use it for a weapon
she would have to tie me to the ceiling
but then i find it hurts me
i pray you will soothe my sorry soul
waiting for the grey men to go
'cause i ca not park on a hill
hey hey what is your name
of all of the people in the world
lord i am one lord i am two lord i am three lord i am four
i will be speaking to you sweetly
in some kind of a dream?
i was dancing with my darlin'
i know you will be a star
we will wait a lifetime for you
motive of quicker location is slammed
he is a new world man [repeat x ]
this cripple here that you clothe and feed
but they better say it fast
this darkness she is left in my heart
look at the way we live
constant change is here to stay
to make the wrong moves seem right
you think you have had a lot of fun
try now we could only lose
you were way off the mark
and how he kissed me under the moorish wall
taste the whip and love might given likely
a refuge for the coming night
i am the king of the blues
dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
i turned my back on the devil
peaceful times have come and gone
peace of mind after what i have been through
i began thinkin' about our ancient friends
i have been wishin' out the days
and the places that surround me now
i have done nothing to you
look at the dangerous cheaters taking a stand
i would be running up that hill
i saw today in the entertainment section
but i could not make it hold
until i saw the morning paper
no it wo not come off!
he trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child
seems to follow me wherever i go
i will find somewhere where they do not care who i am
she do not love you anymore
get me down on my knees
they want your tears to fall
come on over lay down beside me
if you have got the secret tell me do
they put the world in a tin can
and more much more than this
and if he felt he had to direct you
i did my best it was not much
hurricane has the trade winds blowing
but if you take an axe to me
do not shit where they are not supposed to
so i followed all the way
you and me we were always meant to always meant to be
bangs his cup across the bars
ooh i know she knows but still i go on
ah remember me i used to live for music
going out with discogoing out like bacchanal
oh i could be newyou underestimate me
who really do not have a clue
it rests in an empty palm
your disciples are riddled with metaphors
yeah that is the hardest part
the boy lies in the grass with one blade
on this side of sane oh lord
i will love you till the end of the world
hit it! make it a dead one
you should be happy with what we give you
you will be the prize for my pain
surge of energy spark of inspiration
have you ever seen a picture
but their spirit shall live on in
everybody knows that the war is over
i know we have to meet
and a bright and nameless vision
stand here beside my baby watch the orange glow
scares me silly but it gets me going
well the landslide will bring it down down
slave to the hormone body and soul
one thought is all it takes
future is abovebut in the past he is slow and sinking
and i have seen new wars
and there is nothing that you really want to take
she treats me good each and every night
i would climb a tall mountain
i have so little time and i am only passing through
was that the devil is stagecoach
do not try to rescue me
until then i will settle down
just like a station on the radio
i would not trade them because i made them
i am gonna love her till my dying day
no doors no windows no fireplace
i have been away too long
too late for debate too bad to ignore
was big enough to be frightened of
i want you to catch me
to see for the first time
how can i quit to be there
what i gotta do to fit
it is not a due? of burning pounds that ruins your mind
but the river is in flood
some folks they have one yeah
it slips between your hands like water
i miss your kissin' and i miss your head
it broke my heart and i lost control
i listened to your kisses at the door
forget all i have said please bear me no ill oh by jingo
have the light of day obscured
there were children crying and colors flying
i loved you a long time ago
take me back to my home town
the entire solar system withstanding geographical combat
give to god what belongs to god
she knows how to set me free
and i know i will be hunting high and low
so much pleasure that it feels like pain
when it all seems so stupid
i was raised by the praise of a fan who said i upset her
like they have done so many times before
i am hanging on your words
but something makes you turn around
i am stuck here on the grass with the pain that ever grows
i am familiar with your kind
you are so far from me
the strange luck that fate has cast me
i have been mistaken for dead
corus: nobody said it was easy together we can help change the world come
show you fire to keep you warm
and when you get out on your own
erase the race that claim the place
in the darkness before the dawn
there is room for a life in your womb!
scream my friends do not call me
my head is bowed in shame
it is been there for many days
young girls they know what they are after
oh people do not you understand
blossoms falling from the cherry tree
with somebody these are the words that you got to learn to say now
someone who will help me see things
you are lost and gone clementine!
night talk and romance like beat the clock
well i have seen some women
you can walk around in new york while you sleep in penge
sorry you did not see him
do not gimme no lip i am wiping off the spit
but it ai not you who has to cry cry cry
and with the horses prancin' through the fields
he often calls me down to eat
bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
the colour of death sweet vanilla essence
so she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
sing it  your nation y'all party
the lemon kid is my friend
and the soul outwears the breast
getting paid to play the fool
take my hand make a stand
the sun came climbing up the cab
she is not had a life
regrets i have had a few
do you ever get the feeling
a life-sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole
i am waiting for the unforgiven
and the wind did roar and the wind did moan
believe me i am just asking you to sway
and i wo not back down no i wo not back down
i do not know if i am closer to heaven but
starin' up at the smoke and the flames
carved in your name with my pocket knife
you say oh sing one we know
you can go your own way
she saw me coming for miles
yes i can tell you babe
and drink the milk of paradise
i got you and that is all i want
i have not been this happy
here comes frank and poor old jim
face up or you can only back down
took a plane across the world
i knew i had done something wrong
stag said well just count the holes in the
picture 'eyes in a cold steel frame'
it is hard to take the world
there is department stores and toilet paper
here is the bedroom - you are not allowed in there
and then they rock some more
raise the sticks then bring 'em down
when i can fly and fall to all the end and i can fly
johnny wants to think of a joke
my skin is rubber on a skeletal body
and i am losing my faith
there is a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes
they will face you down to their level
so she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
turn the jukebox up he said
i am trapped inside and dying
dance magic dance dance magic dance x
well i ai not had no love since i do not know when
hey-hey it is the tall sail
you drink to rumors and talk
i hear it hit the landing
but it whispers 'who are you?'
when floods they came or tides they raised ever
that great steady rock of gibraltar
ah you loved me as a loser but now you are worried that i just might win
and put the linen all in it
that you do not want me there by your side
i know it works for me
and we would speak of a swedish room
i walked in light when you held me close that night
i ai not had those lips those lips around me
open up open up baby let me in
oh she do not want him
at whose gates i ai not been delivered
black and red and yellow black and red and yellow
i am like a black man
for the thirst and for the hunger come the conference of birds
you feel it slip away slip away
love i do not know about love
everything is alright everything is alright babe
let the ocean swell dissolve 'way my past
when i touch it it gives forth a sound
all along the watchtower princess kept the view
like a willow like a fountain
she will take a slowcar to china
for all the things you did
faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
the devil appeared like jesus through the steam in the street
what plans will you pull through?
i caught myself believin' that i needed god
stab me in the dark let me disappear
why tarry all night in the ruin
and you who were bewildered by a meaning
where where is my gypsy wife tonight?
i am not one to believe in magic
oh baby those skinny girls they are so quick to murder
and a little piece of hope holding us together
not as close as they appear
when i am not with you babe
and i just got broken broken into two
she will let you watch her undress
as i watch you from the road
and the night will come much closer too
i will take a train take a train
and i would not want it any other way
i am just a fool for your love
i love to see you naked over there
and he is talkin' about burnin' but i am so damned cold
one day i fly through a crack in the sky
pulling her black hair back from her happy heart-shaped face
and here am i just a shy young fool
i saw the distance i saw the past
that is the place where the cancer cowboy rides
it is coming for me through the trees
so in a manner of speaking
and you will see how you took after him
when i go back to the house hear that woman is mouth
oh with a mind that renders everything sensitive
it is not funny at all
death ai not the same without you dear
this is the story of johnny rotten
because her inner peace was much too loud
carry your world and all your hurt
i was held in chains but now i am free
with many snakes in all his hands
when you choose the precious few
up the river where the bridges crouch
finding that what you once thought was real
we were runnin' through the night
since you left my side side side
and there ai not nothin' like a friend
break the sky and tell me what it is for
but something is got to give
pray and the heathen lie will disappear
nail me to my car and i will tell you who you are
attention shoppers buy with a conscience and save!
i would walk out of heaven
since that day i heard it mentioned
i am seventeen and my looks can prove it
i had it once i lost it though
baby well i am still waiting
i ca not sleep and i lay and i think
when you fall in love with eyes dilational la la
oh yeah huh huh huh huh yeah
becomes a sharp and angry sword
all of the headlines said 'passion crime
i get the strangest feeling you belong
no i am not going through it again
and honey i know of a hell yeah
you will see him in your nightmares
ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
lord knows i did everything i could
it is a love draw nearer
and we can relive our youth
dry your tears forget while we are here
up here so high the sky i scrape
and the twisted life of saints
and all the worlds they have shown you
but i had a scheme so cool and so clean
you will find a reason when you discover
these dreams could have seen her
so i am turnin over honey
i am coming coming coming honey
every night i am waiting for
there is nothing more that we can do
o my love i must be going
and it is not very far
there is a mirror ball twirlin'
yeah it is right around the corner
now you are standing at the top of the stairs
he is protecting you and me
in the dark in the dream
people steal from their own kind
you love me you hate me
but i have got things inside my head
and guide you into my arms
are in the fire on your dying day
there is room for a life in your womb woman
now i find that most of the time
of how the others must see the faker
they are buildin' the gallows outside my cell
the full moon is dead skin
you really should have dug a little deeper there
and he pisses like i cry
follow me the wise man said
he is a ghost he is a guru
for the god to take us
a devil in a market place
you know who i am he said
i know that you are with me and the way you will show
somewhere she lies this lovely creature
that lay in store for us
but the glass spider would have long gone having known that the babies
a sadness i do not like
stepping out of the page into the sensual world
when you reach for a star
i know i am gonna die blues
you will be working in the darkness
do not be afraid of the man in the moon because it is only me
we wo not need a map believe me
went to the bar yeah yeah
just to keep you as a child
in the lorraine motel it is hot it is hot
you might feel it and just not show it
all things either good or ungood
you can lay your burden down on me
a use for his newly-found wealth
but now that is all i have
they all go all the way up to the top of the night
they just confuse the sunny calendar
all this sound is breaking up
i hold a cup of wisdom
the wine is not to my liking
more than they do theirs somehow?
every time i think of you
you held on to me like i was a crucifix
i know my brain is gone damaged beyond repair
back to back to back a better better better
and it went round and round the house
sit round doing nothing all together very fast
does not mean i am lost
somehow this is it i knew
that is how the light gets in
and there is no god with the plan it is sad
said the man with the hammer hammering the anvil
i am loaded told that all is for naught holds me down
on the very love which i i do not wish to claim
but it is not nor do i care
you probably wo not ever see me again
i would still be your rock of gibraltar
i have got petrol in the car
you do not know the consequences
yet i know i must be gone
i know that my goal is more than a thought
everybody is saying everything is all right
i can hear that dreadful overflowing sound
silently i lose and darkness comes
i am gonna get the message
come on oh my star is fading
while you are deciding i have been finding
pilot back i need my squadron
all the heaven is in the motion
driven to this point by a chain of events
i wo not get to get what i am after
let is meet tomorrow if you choose
oh do i deserve to be?
we will take this place apart
i will be your exhibition of atrocity
brown to black it is coming back
like a drunk in a midnight choir have tried in my way to be free
there is no more i can do
i saw you on the barstool when
memories back when she was bold and strong
we do not see what they are made of
i swallow my words to keep from lying
he takes the pieces in his hand
and caught that young man is eye
only you can save the light of man
or a light that i could not see
who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy
as long as you are not afraid to feel
quick as dogs and truly dead were we
up in dark and empty skies
we will give you our truth
all my dreams are wasting now
they nurse you when you are ill of health
we are all on one road and we are only passing through
oh there ai not no reason for you to declare war on the one who loves you so
wo not need no shadow man
but your fear is as old as the world
it is deep and dark like the water was
and the road just leads to nowhere
at least the dirt will wash off
and shuffle off that mortal coil and mortal madness
he could not do it properly
she stands in the luminous air
and there ai not nothing at all to do but rise and follow
you strike my side by accident
in the heat of the beat and the lights
all i know is you are not with me
imagination is all i want from you
when i was friends with one or two
but if i did i would kneel down and ask him
steer your heart past the truth that you believed in yesterday
i do not know what i can say
we each get what we deserve
a fate we may delay we say
but it sounds like my voice lost and old
coming up a which way signall good truants must decide
soon you will be crying unwishing you dreamt of be
written by redd stewart and pee wee king
oh look out you rock n rollers
to raise my voice and say
with the very same boy hold tight
i knew he was different in his sexuality
to not have to live up to
why deny all the troubles when combined
for you and i to grow
i have traveled now for many miles
those who are dead are not dead
your letters they all say that you are beside me now
dom do do da dom do do da
i could learn to be a man
all down my veins my heart-strings call
yes i have tried my best
to feel all the hard times
and i lay me down in a bed of snow
no do not lose your trust
i like to drive my car
well i will run babe but i will come running
and the heights i did aspire
when you are under the usa
just like a face in the crowd
driven to another den of thieves
first one then the others flapping blackly down
got a tattoo that says gether thru life
you think you are a star
take your life and tear it apart
someday they wo not let you so now you must agree
i will never get it right
but you see my hands were tied
the holy war was slowly building
bury me out on the prairie
what is it like to be face to face with me?
and when it is just me and you
i can do anything right or wrong
and the next it is rolling over me
i am gonna make it cool again
by a demon or a god
and they might be the ones
about the way things used to be
it is all about my world my world
left all his junk and just moved out
back when i was feeling broken
the bed is made and the candles burning
and he will walk til he finds her
so fucking freezin' they jump out the car everybody wants some
and you are with me wherever i go
oh the way that gravity turns on you and me
even in your arms i know
of the dreams that he brings
while the rows and rows of houses
but the stomach knots make my hands unsteady
another man moved by sleight of hand
i will get away with it
he will always love you it is sad
i mean if you can just picture it
je le vois en me penchant
do you think i would ever let you
and i just ca not see the fun in
when it feels wrong it seems so long
but it burns with a restless flame
helping one another just a righteous brother
and they seem to lose control
i had ordered from a magazine
no singing in the acid rain
and never never going to doubt
but i have not decided why
i am just looking for looking for a friend
light a fire a flame in my heart
that is the kind of woman
let is pick up your soul
and the feelings that get left behind
you must lose me like an arrow
we must do what must be done
you get so used to deception
i never thought i could fail
so never mind the bad news
now i lay me down in dreamland
i am so scared about the future and i wanna talk to you
is torn away and life just stops
they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
and there is no one there to raise them if you did
i am just looking for a friend
is that i am lost whenever you go
what a typical mother is son
i was a passion that passed her spare time
she wears my tombstone at her head
has given up on the me and you
i am going by the back door
my dear i wish you joy
i walk on through the rain
oh and the waves are coming in
i am not the man they think i am at home
and the tape is your voice
and i know i am dead on the surface
you ca not keep on riding
my love my love where did you go?
span the sky in clockwork arcs
try to kill it all away
now you are looking for god in exciting new ways
she moves something deep inside of me
that i never had one of your children
well who would hold a price
when the big lie hits your eye
when i was down when i was hurt
i changed my style to silver
we know all our lines so well uh-huh
the water and the flower is a bad dream
you ca not take it any other way yeah yeah
we travel on the road to adventure
tear into yourself count tales on your arm
for you know that i must say goodbye
now i have gained some understanding
it is no good for you now
you are a little lost on the fall
your body is a long thing
that is the price of love the price of love
the force got back to normal
jack wept and kissed his shadow
someone on whom you can always depend
and independent from the scene that i have known
i am his sceptre and shaft
the way of where the fuzz might be some day
feel it! see what you are doing to me
we have got five years what a surprise
of my ' buick is dash
no sex no consequence no sympathy
we will find all we are meant to find
think small with the fire gang tap your pretty little feet
what is it that you whisper
me between the eyes and cry
i bring joy and i bring tears
come sail your ships around me
where the hero is a guy named you
like i am the demon resurrection
all the sailors with their seasick mamas
it is alright it is okay come clap your hands
her gasping words: baby i love you
in the middle month of winter
mary grab the baby the river is rising
under my breathi swear by sin
take a look at the lawman
endless rain into a paper cup
now let my body do the moving
somebody help me out because i am tied down to my bed
i would rather cry than forget you
id die to see the rain but i can not can not move
with a leg under the red dress i wish i could see
you ai not got no self-respect
i saw you watching from the stairs you are everyone that ever cared
oh when we danced so closely
i miss you already yeahi miss you all day
'let rosy get ya heaven dial -! '
like a fear in the heart i will be yours
when i must remove your wings
over near the bandstand with john finn is wife
to all the people that you became
drink all you can but you wo not forget her
i fill the room with people
and 'tis i that moan- and groaneth
sometimes i walk sometimes i kneel
do not ever say you are on your way down when
but now it is gettin' late
they are hip to it man they are in the groove
the shadows live in the rafters like
he will tear the sky down
like your face i do not understand
out of which the nameless makes
i wish i knew where he was
i i i need something to live for
the tightrope that i am walking just sways and ties
look at the light all the time it is a changing
and when the night is cloudy
i remember the night and the tennessee waltz
the wind blows on your check
words by neil peart music by alex lifeson
the kitten jumped back to her lap
well i was only a kid did not know enough to be afraid
never get to fall in love never get to be cool
and there is plenty of food
i would rather smoke and phone my ex
make it bend to your will
it is for all those creeps watching tickers on tv
and i would have to pinch her
we can circle around like hurricanes
in sunlight and i see the way that you breathe
all that we can do is just survive
the rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow and on the mound
need you in the afternoon to fan me when i am hot
i will pull down your temples
here comes that time again when
it is time we cut him down to size
think of us as fatherless scum
for being such a rich one
just to feel the living night
yea i will be hanging upside down
i do what i have to do
now i sit around and watch
of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire in your eyes
though i try and try to hide my feelings
when the actor reaches his death
and they need something to do
things i know are not true
she only sparkles at times for you tonight
that it is all built upon
and i love you without measure
on every street every car every surface in nature
victims of the vines of changes
and the oaks ignore their pleas
the world you are walking in
where the farmers used to live
could not hold on she could not hold no she folded
till he finds what he is searching for
i will be the rose of sharon for you
in a long coat grey hat smoking a cigarette
hey all you little waves run away
saying how i always loved you darling
going to send my message through to you
the moon do not know if it is day or night
i clutch at the greasy tails of my dreams
let is everybody get it on get it on
come on now bring it back to me
is it the way that you told me
or did i ever really cry
i cannot follow you my love
and she brings it down again
this time the big hurt will end
i said father change my name
look inside do you feel anything but bitter?
some are burned or swept away
we were young and we were wild
when i get home i am gunna kick out that mouse
it is all right when you are around rain or shine
a tiny girl screams for mother
i am sure you are not protected for it is plain to see
we have got nothing to lose
you will be mine you will be mine
as i lay here with you
say farewell to the passing of the years
down the snakes and up the ladder
plenty of people will kill you
really wants to be a star himself
my mother was a girl you could call on
oh i wish that i could live it all again
catching all the names in the news
and we moved through the days
let is paint the mirror black
now i am the ape hunkered by the fire
we have got time to kill
i would give my jewels and caviar
and you want to travel blind
hey! get up on your feet and go get it now
oh yes i can hear your young
and i ca not wait for you to take my place
and he would shrug and ask to stay
silk scarf and a napkin hidden in a drawer
freezin' rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
it ai not easy it ai not easy
but somehow i found my baby that night
that you sit in now and yearn
i suppose it all meant something to you
i am junk but i am still holding up
i feel i have got to move
in another lonely universe we are laying side by side
bigger stronger drive a faster car
but your lips are void of history
let go let go let go
i am the atrocity film star
they are picking up the joints now that they have joined the gang
and we are marching to bastille day la guillotine will claim
feel the motion with this song
i can see that they have hurt you dear
if life is a photograph fading in the mirror
so i would like a quiet town please
who dance to a synthetic band
locked into the pages of your book
young girls do not kiss me goodbye
now if you can manage to get
she is like death on two legs
i miss you already yeahi miss you always
and there are no diamonds in the mine
i will kiss you in the rain
smash some windows make a noise
just like a dead things smiles
i know perfect is not for real
i ca not hide inside this room
i am not one with a sense of proportion
and in my mind i still need a place to go
how can he remember who he is talking to?
so much pain to go through
i got to have some of your attention give it to me
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
you know that i will be waiting
the wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall
si les grands yeux de mon dieu
i have been looking for something
they call me the workin' man
a man can lose his past in a country like this ? wandering aimless ?
oh god i ca not stop laughing
but when i crawl into your arms
save the planet for another day
all the time it is a changing like then again
you should be happy with what you got
i do not think you understand
as though it were their own
hello i know that you are unhappy
crying papa you promised to play
i can fly fly fly away
he said well bartender it is plain to see
extra verse from dj spooky remix from scream  soundtrack:
and in the red now all the rivers flow
i am dressed in lace sailing down a black reverie
to move in for the kill
you are wise you are tough you have heard their lies enough
aware that i would never outgrow the pain
swallowed up the world without a trace
tell me when you are cool again
and the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him
that can haul up the sails
i will even buy a wedding ring
it is just a part of life
all we ever look for a little bit of you
shoots towards me two lanes wide
then we met in ' but we were on different sides
delight delight delight in our youth
now johnny he be having lots of women
we are specialized mechanics in repairing the bitch
with no one there to catch it
you are my north my south my east my west
try to get closer but not too close
you can hardly see it now
when i get home i am gunna make that call
grow nick is song is also available
this house is as old as i am
there is a shoulder where death comes to cry
a-makes much more sense to live in the present tense
how can life become her point of view
there is a snake coming out of the darkness
and you do not know what is up the bend
while all the women came and went barefoot servants too
though you may feel tired and blue
say it is just rock'n roll
got some friends that i can go to working for
you are a poison that flows into my veins
he said i am gonna buy a gun and start a war
a heavy burden lifted from my soul
empty vessels of dreams so loud
i can smell her perfume i can taste her lips
i hear a sound in the night
big birds flying across the sky
wait for you to join the group
cause there is but you and something within you
so we ca not go up or stay up find the thumb dumb' in your ear brain
of the remains of his beserk little twists
between the moonlight and the lane
oh i prefer absence said she
the rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
i ca not believe that our love is dead
are you getting out are you dropping bombs?
i was not in there dear hiding all away
even when you do not understand
a little green worm inside my head
he took my share and sealed it in cave
but i ca not let you go
the only good thing about tv
well you ca not use the car
trying to get back to the rudiments
to drink rotting wine from your hands
yes you better knock knock knock on wood i ca not leave her
a star arose in my own cage
and the cross was held aloft
what am i supposed to do?
you know she knows what it is all about
sometimes i can feel you in the air
hounds that howl through the nightwhy do i
and there is nothing to keep them
you will still find the past right
i wasted all your time honey honey
now she put her kid away she is gone to get a hit
for i have dined on honey dew
wheel goes round landing on a leap of fate
too early for the rainbow too early for the dove
i was marching to the wrong drum
but i done married and settled down
they are only lonely for the life they led
i believe in what i hear
she prayed balanced on a hurdle
has your band begun to rust?
do not you see you are in the way - between a man and a woman
he rushed inside to tell his wife
so he could whip her harder and harder
why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
as it gets better and better
keys rain like heaven is hair
that was when i ruled the world
well love will come a-knockin' with my toolbag and my stockin'
you will stumble in my footsteps
and it brings out the thug in me
puts his hand 'cross his mouth
driven to the margin of terror
till the flesh drops from your bones
could have been a princess you would be a king
it is such a precious thing
we want you big brother big brother
and it sure got me confused
well my lawyer says he is sorry he missed my case
drug freaks in the crack house
do not interfere - you are not needed here
now the killed waits for the killer
our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
cause i am stuck here on the ground cold and drunk as i might be
no white or black just grey
that i am someone in your life
riding on  wheels a woman on his knee
when you are near i fear you
i do not need a lover no no
one of the rabble needs mummy
you can call it another lonely day
a little visit reminding me of his presence
i need to see you naked
there is a wild wind blowing
who spoke of many powers that he had
the answer is not classified- it is my heart
they gave boys to quite tasteless friends of mine
flags that line old main street
then read me the list of the crimes that are mine
i should grow wings and just forget the club
hey hey oh hey oh oh
but you ai not having none of that
just like a poor porcelain doll
hey jack i better shake it off put her out of my head
i am a sick man drowning
he fed the snake a vat of milk
and i take myself out a nice cold beer
and you are lookin' pretty pissed
am i hard enough? am i tough enough?
i do not believe in an interventionist god
bad news is just an excuse
and it is on the table
two steps ahead of him punctures in your neck
in a century of planetary storms
she would only make friends in expensive cars
i am aching for you baby
my mother said to get things done
she is waiting in that warm room
and i want to get away and go i want to be i want to be
like a dream it might have ended there
and they are gone like the smoke
and you are sleeping in your harness
and heaven is in front of me
i thought it was there for good so i never tried
where the thin men stalk the streets
baby do not let them in
of the light of the light of the light of the light in your eyes
i can live anyhow win or lose
room for a life in your womb
all the victims who will never learn
and i was down on m' luck
and i take comfort from memories there
i am not surpriesed to see you waiting here
god is afoot magic is alive
what goes on what goes on
and the red light flashed beware
never would have known of me before
look in look out look around
saviors and satan is all around me
o brother my cup is empty
i get out of my car
how much difference does it make yeah
now i know what it is worth
can you show me where it hurts?
when i strut down the street i could hear its heartbeat
pues un gran saguarazo te ha de gustar
we do not need much of anything
and you are weak and you are harmless
got to spread love around got to spread it around
smiled at your funny little ways
and he sang all night long
because i came around here so violent
we we are dust in a world
against his brother and against his family
valkyries she hangs it on a thorn
like a candle in the wind
the fact that she is only too real
and it is deeper than sorrow
i will never be your beast of learning
i listen to my juddering bones
or let your mind leave your body
i think i said that last time
and i will make you believe in me
and it is been a long strange day
give your money to the gateman
we are apt to think it cruel but sometimes
it seemed the taste was not so sweet
life comes i can steal your heart form your neck
and he left me feeling just like a two bit whore
they found her the next day cuffed to the bed
michael i watch myself from where you are
cause i am on my way to rest my head
look up i look up at night
you are on your own once more
when i am counting up my demons
that clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me
and green gloves on her hands
well i peeked through the crack and looked way back
sometimes i reach to myself dear god
a lone loon dives upon the water
and hear your voice so fair
the holy or the broken hallelujah
the rolling river shores of changes
i still do not know which way to go
he had a colt  and a deck of cards
motor sensational paris or maybe hell - i am waiting
she what did we do that was wrong
silently i wait alone for you
back where there is nowhere to stay
we know major tom is a junkie
thought i saw the lord is disciples laugh at that
i have read more than a hundred books
the minor fall the major lift
i do not want to hang around this hell
seems the more you make equals the loneliness you get
i will take you baby baby baby
a traditional song which was a likely inspiration for where the wild roses
i am tired i am lookin' for a spot to drop
jangling jack flies off his seat
do not think i am impatient
i am scared to look i am scared to see
grey sky over a black town
i am a drug that makes you dream
i have entered under this dark roof
they married for peace and were gone
he will build a better whirlpool
praise him a little bit more
it is so strange the way things turn
'cause i am all alone all alone
far above their dreams and hopes
one minute i held the key
but you are the world to me
and i will never desert you here
show me the place where the suffering began
will the fire hit the iron
but you should know me better by now
can turn around no ca not turn around
i get the same old dreams same time every night
full of a longing for something i do
laughed at his long black hair his animal grace
i was hiding in plain sight
and i will kiss you one more time and leave you on
i gave you all that is mine
and in the end we lie awake and we dream of making our escape
i ai not no fortunate son son son
and you have got me eating
said the shadow to jack henry
dancing down the aisle of a plane
then i took my laundry basket
da da da dumb [repeat: x]
well i know what i am
i pinned an iron cross to my lapel
and the street below showered in shards of broken glass
please be mine please be mine
we sit at the gate and scratch
but the streets are paved with gold
but they built up with their bare hands
and do not let the veil drop behind jennifer is veil
the joining of the weekend monday daylight
but i have lost you lost you for the rest of my life
just wanted a way of keeping you inside
i pushed off into the river
'cause all we have got left is a beat in the night
i do not like the memory
as i look upon your face aw huh
if i had known then what i now know x
yeah it is true when you
dancing till the big bell chimes
you know i will never lose you baby
or feel the day has possibilities
i am just holding the fort
there is no doubt but when i am with you
oh get outta' my fuckin' face
all the innocents broken with lies
well if you ever plan to motor west
he lit a match he laid in bed
none of them along the line nobody up it is worth
but there is only you and me
i am lookin' through african eyes
all you ever wanted was love
and at full tilt and in full flight
once inside i am out of my mind
he tries to run but he do not get far
to mend the damage that we have done
i will try to say a little more
i should be celebrating to a moving melody
i hate being in these situations
they rode in one long column
a shot rings out to a spiritual groove
there is no comfort in here
i am not obliged to read you statements of the year
and the cider is laced with acid
i know a crowd who or something
every river that i have tried to cross
and beat you down at cool canasta
all the time it is a changing
but he is already walkin' past
they crawl out of their holes for me
do not return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
and life itself is hardly more
so you moved away the mountain
i am not a man of single reason
stop hey what is that sound
to the top of the hill
to the land of sun tan lotion
lunatics and monsters underneath my bed
if i never said i loved you
you looked for the sunshine that brought warmth to your mind
hoping that the horror will recede
so the lovers begin with a kiss
she said no you cannot see
the more you read we have been deceived
turned my back on the angel too
he meets us at the lift
but it is just your shirt
i can see her coming even now
orpheus went leaping through the fields
and then when she gets tired she just flies along on her way
no! you can hide! you can run!
your little head upon my shoulder
party time one more girl everybody is affected
i have got the village i love - dig everything
you have done me no right
it is the kind that moves on
and i did not feel like very much
the station seems so cold the ticket is in my hand
the differences we sometimes feared to show
take me back to my home ground
and the rats and the dogs and the men all come
and here is a man still working for your smile
i wonder if my kids are thinking of me
they got a message from the action man
got to get your love back babe
i do not think my new resolve
hot air gets me into a blackout
hey joe where you going with that gun in your hand?
slupping stitches leading to so slight a hole
c amon c amon face it
i will soothe your primal fears
in this very room where i have sentenced
in the hearts and minds of man
or the love is too weak
i have got believers in me
like the brothers in blood sisters who ride
the lady from another grinning soul
i will send shivers up your spine
still do not know what i was waiting for
but if this life were a bought thing
but the film is a saddening bore
they are gonna shut me down my love
i lost my baby to another man
never can say goodbye no no no no now
cannot find the comfort in this world
i will wait up in the dark
it is the biggest rocket i could find
how long how long how long
sonic reducer ai not no loseroh
so he wrote it on a wall
look at the frequencies of which i vibrate
these streets have never been paved with gold
they say that i turn innocence to panic
i wo not take you to court
we just kept moving moving on
you just need to achieve something that rings true
at windows in judgment of the world he created
do we chaff against the repetition
taken in by the delicate noise
like a clue to a nightmare that i ca not believe
i am leaving anger in the past
it is a new me yo it is not you you old news
i do not think they are that dumb
you have friends and we have reasons
you feel a little queasy decidedly ill
this burning inside is so real
bet you wonder what they do
soon you will grow so take a chance
but you have seen who is in heaven is there anyone in hell
it is deceiving i do not believe him
unit one is in trouble and it is scared out of its wits
you you just do not know what it is like
the help is just around the corner
i am alone in a corner
o baby please do not cry
there is slaughter in the air
just as we hit the green
it is the confidence i need
along the snowy paths of modesty
we watched our friends grow up together
do not say sorry for me
hero - not the glamor girl
by the time i get to phoenix she will be rising
i have got to have your word on this
in a room filled with coral
for i have loved you so long
the space between wonder and why
can you hear what i hear babe?
as they head for the bar in their lumpy suits
but she is so od would on weeping
yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower
put your shame in a box
ooh come here it comes there it goes grasp what you can
the space in which we are traveling
see the many that have lived and died
all the towers of ivory are crumbling
you take me home to glory is throne by and by
and crawled on the floor for you
when it all comes down so hard
and try to get it straight
i ca not see the clothes you wear
i wish i could take the pain for you
it is easy to get buried in the past
i have gone flying trying to meet you
in the early morning rain with nowhere to go
yes you better knock knock knock on wood no oh better
my balls oh rye whiskey will stick to your ass
so i kissed her little sister
all the colours of the universe
another sleepless night a sun that wo not fall
i do not want your point of view
jump to the ground as the turbo slows
the priests praise my name on this night
then we could be heroes just for one day
you said we have all day
look back in anger feel it in my voice
we are happy ma we are having fun
you talk as we walk along
on monday baby i went a-walking
dippin' and bobbin' in the sun
do not let me hear you say life is taking you nowhere angel
and i am feeling like a waltz -
an undertow of futures laid to waste embraced
turn away cause i need you more
oh that is the price that you pay
o his road is dark and lonely
it is okay it is okay
when surf comes out tomorrow lets go
i am glad you stood in my way
so if i gotta die i am gonna listen  my body tonight
while it is true that every dog will have his day
i am listed with the enemies of love
hey fellas have you heard the news? oh yeah
or if you want to take me for a ride
for the heart with no companion for the soul without a king for the prima
where the winds own forget me nots blow
it do not matter how it all went wrong
you ca not believe what you learn
he is crashing out with sylvian
i wo not ask you any favors
see the sun set in the hand of the man
i will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
i am giving it all in a moment for you
i have got one more trick for you
i feel you each move you make
yesterday the sun was shining but you are finding the sun it
i say he should watch his ass
dark visions he had last night
he knew i would not hide
all the things we need to show
that though the angels never come
there is something radical in our hands
this girl is a lonely girl
outside i sit on the stone steps
got all kinds of poison in
and the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle
let me bore you with this story
the voice is now the choir
she curses the queue at the zulus
hear a voice in the hall
it does not matter which you heard
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
sixteen years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath
i am listed under broken hearts
the more i walk across the lines the more i glide
about what you think of me
it is all about my world
no time left and i know i am losin'
there is been many others oo-oo-oo-oohh so many times
where the awed and the mediocre wait
time in her eyes is spawning past life
or did the dream have me?
the need for validation babe gone completely
but oh what can you do
when the thing you have planned
then they will cut off the supply
she remembered all the shadows and the doubts
open their hearts to the fun
you know i love you so
watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone
i got bugs in my room
i will throw a blanket over
knowing how badly i need her
with a love that is true always
but you know that i still love you
i went to his parties as a straight minority
you ca not see the sun
we are much more relaxed right now
if ya wanna catch a saint
in a cloud of doubts and fears
with their building blocks and their tiny
and launches its way to the stars
trying to make my way to nashville tennessee
but it must have been a dream
i know where i am going
i bet you wonder what they do
i oh i am still alive
no what you gonna do you just cry
i keep poking at him with my stick
all that you can do is wish them well
move up i do not need devotion
if it is a thrill you are looking for
my secret garden is not so secret anymore
and she stands there over me
those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me
and i consider you a friend
remember i had friends like you
every time she closed her eyes
let me know c amon let is go yeah
o o o ya outa luck ya outa luck
and she moves among the flowers
take your shoes off and throw them in the lake
and guns did flare and guns did bawl
i was hiding from the big lie
this could be good as it gets
than training these guns of those men in the sand
do you think that you believe in yours
do not you know that it is true?
where someone is not moving you a little further down the way
this waltz this waltz this waltz this waltz
i am a fool fool for your love
it is a crying shame if i ever loved you
but you did not hear us then
back in the days of covered wagons
saying 'where she gone? where she gone? '
come on it is not over!
who said they were through with dealing
and awoke me from my sleep
her winter lips as cold as stone
i wore white bucks on my feet
i got no time for livin'
i was walking up the stairs
once in a while when things go wrong
yeah we swore on that night we would be friends till we died
i have never felt better then when i am alone eddie
that is ok man 'cause i love god
to the soft musk of her hollows
you are the measure of my dreams
and they laugh and they lust
i ca not wait for you to operate
we are the ones who have to fly
please see for me she has a coat so warm
she will come she will go she will lay belief on you
like their father or their dog just died
that a light is shining through
she took my hand this lovely creature
and the days grew shorter for captain kennedy
got my eye on a little girl
she is got a ticket to nowhere
take me up to the top of the city
swoop down and tell you that it do not make sense
just running scared each place we go
and the rain it hammered down
his strength was failin' but he still ran a run
if you pick up the beat
and it is not some idle claim
where a young man has a chance of making good
though nothing will keep us together
any escape might help to smooth
do not even think about reachin' me i wo not be home
every spark a drifting ember of desire
i reached for you but you were gone
what is done is done and everything is different somehow
but with her hot cocoa and her medication
the wind could howl round our ears
and time ran out of you and you ran out of time
i want a spirit that is calm
is a dream with a mission
for you dear i was born
he would like a lover is wings to fly on
one day the sun will come out
if you ever feel like something is missing
you have the right to food money
i know you get crazy but try not to lose your grip
tying all the canvas flaps down
i do not live without you
which one of us is really fucked up that is the question we pose to you
i keep her photograph against my heart
and i loved you when our love was blessed
and when you change the facts
you gotta watch what you say
what is the point saying rescue me!
but any sudden movement i have got to write it down
take my eyes from what they have seen
song of summer in his hand
for one year nobody parked a car in carmichael is space
and you give me this feeling this everglow
tortured and all i cannot do
all i can do now is wait for noise
sorrow is child lifts up her hand
well i will be breaking these rocks
waitin' watchin' the clock it is four o'clock it is got to stop
the fiddler fiddles something so sublime
so wo not you let me see
oh no i never meant to do you harm
alone listless breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
they will never hear it anyway
a slave to the drive of obsession
witness the man reachin' up from the gutter
when i should but i ca not let you go
and twenty-seven angels from the great beyond
daddy took an old guitar and sang
may be waiting your true love
was the last of a dying breed
you know i will come today
if you do not then lie
i wanna fall fall so hard
all i want is for you to make love to me
seems i am sweeping up the ashes
i ca not stand another drink
it is only someone else is potatoes
bomb blast victim fights for life
to see what it feels like now
once you hold the hand of love it is all surmountable
get the balance right get the balance right
the fruit of love was in the future
like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of love-me avenue
even the ones who make you burn
huck hears his own mississippi just rollin' by him woah-woah-woah-woah
he could be right but who is to know
but not really close our eyes
i was watching a movie with a friend
cause they keep bringing out the dead
that my friends would turn to foes
i said little girls play in big boys games
i will bet you feel exactly like i do
do not mean a lot now
with games that she likes to play
i feel that life has blown a great big hole through me
the sailors often smiled and said
a dying non-human writes unkind words
all of the headlines said 'passion crime:
i got bugs in my roomone on one
i do not mean to be so nihilistic
girls they come and they go
and i do not know what i am talking about
with some features of your own
or i might just stop loving you
the queen wore the white gloves the county of song
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
turned out to be all talk
with the rhythm of my own reactions
but it might have been a vulture
you that build all the bombs
i do not want to follow death and all of his friends
i want to be a lawyer
i am running late they will close the bar
that it is cool to be so tough
form a dream to rise to
carry your world carry your world
it belongs to mr sniff and tell
we packed up all our bags
smoked through a pen and i would do it again
are you the teachers of my heart?
to live between the wars in our time
can you feel this world with your heart and not your brain?
we have bred all our kittens white
every day got plenty of time
and i will believe in you when the world comes apart
this your doctor talking to ya
then we jump through hoops we are divisable now just disappear
just nod if you can hear me
it was ' before the music started
are you back in my life to stay
ooh he is a moody old man
the bitterness that is inside you calling
i do not know for the life of me
i know not where you are
oh his love is to eternity
so i turned on the crowd
god what do you say? what do you say?
well it is father is day and everybody is wounded
flyin' by from day to day
and i lift my glass to the awful truth
i introduced her round my friends
i stand in ruins behind you
we are building a house of the future together
those bonfire lights in the lake of sky
and we know the flag of love is from above
give me the banshees for bvs
i have got the love of a hoochie koochie woman
that in time my heart it will reward me
turn it up turn it up
for we are here to pick you up and bring you home
i do not see the point at all
and i do not and i do not and i do not and i do not
try to set the night on fire yeah
if you are in hell then what can i say
a wound that will not heal
and cry 'no more no more'
and that took a lot of lies
on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
in the name of a piece of dirt
you tell anyone who will listen but you feel ignored
because i came round here to think for it
and then the hammer came down
slowly slowly we lose the time that shares us
please one more time for me
pure as a lover is desire
for all of the guilty to set them free
i watch them from my room they are just passing by
i do not like this new anger
i am a dj i am what i play
i am the cure and disease'
for fear that the spell may be broken
but you have lost it all
and ask them to watch over you
i keep you by my side
says i should go home alone
she just could not face the men--they all understood
let is exchange the experience oh
wheel goes round landing on a twist of faith
new ones walking down the stairs
but i do not know if i am ready yet
he got the feeling they had met before
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
do you laugh when the rats come round to play?
do you want it do you?
some things you ca not forget
starve the poor so they can be well fed
we could laugh and let it all out
oh i will be sleeping by myself
bees an' the butterflies peckin' out his eyes
i would like to help you son
eleven nights he laid in bed
and the money-man chocked him with coins
but do not let it get to you
there are no choices needed to be made at all
the kettle is on the sun has gone
poor lambie cried fo' his mammy
i just wanna live life and be dumb and happy like an american
run through the fields down to the edge of the water
for the kittens in the trees
and when i heard you call to
for an answer that refused to be found
i am lost nowhere to go
and wave my legs around in perfect unison with my partner who really does not
all the colours of the day
i ca not find the reason
the streets are crammed ca not walk
but no-one wants you when you lose
if i ever loved you or no no
and like all the dogs he is
he kills the bull and lives another day
things i would like to say
i got a woman that dances
i look over thirty years i have wished that i was dead
come on and lie to me
there is half of a heaven
i am a poor man is son
fog fished and filtered is filling my case book of
all i can do now is wait for the noise
there is nothing to hurt you in here'
just when i am about to get my hands on her
a awake with a hatchet hanging over my head
ashes to ashes funk to funky
i stand at the window and i look at the sea
i had it all and i risked it all
but in his heart he felt a bliss
for whom none will go mourning
all those places i have found
and this girl is a lonely girl
pretty good at holding up the wall
tell  am i am doing fine
the hopeful depend on a world without end
hold my hand walk beside me
promises me i am as safe as houses
because my love she gone with other boys
are you the one i have been waiting for?
till your muscles start to break down
the blizzard the blizzard of the world
i am ready for the change
no one can touch you now
your chain of command has been silenced now
now is the time to turn the tide
oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
let them all make their own music
and i turn around and look at myself
when i feel the warmth of your very soul
when his hand covered wet hair
the most beautiful words i could ever say
and he walked through the smoke
and i know i was wrong
moses says to noah ''we shoulda dugga deepa one''
i could not take a-just one day
we do not have to talk
done is the missing now all that remain
the sky of daytime dies away
hey hey my woman looks good to me
a fate we made a way we say
as the great screen crackled and popped
i learned this step a while ago
at the touch of a button
is that you have never been right
riding out the day is events
just then billy dilly rolls in and he says you
and i saw that the world
see over in arms i will raise
he said i have had a vision
does he fly like mr superman speak chinese french and dutch?
he is a tiller he has a tiller is hands
dance to the song they are playing on the radio
and i am taking a dive
tuesday gathers up the crumbs under the table
i look at eye level it is not good enough
i lost my love my life that night
all of the firsts and the definite lasts
will you give it to me
it is a god-awful small affair
it was a wicked and wild wind
until we find ourselves at out most distracted
why only jennifer knows that now
would not wanna change a thing
and it is too damned pretty for a man to die
you can do a lot in a lifetime
you and i we got caught down there
you said just drink it up
i wander lonely as a cloud
and satisfy our wanderlust to roam
i ai not s'posed to be just fun
sorrow is child grieves not what has passed
lives connect in webs of gold and razor wire
yeah babe i got you bad
one day carried away in the storms
carry such an easy loadwhy do i
i lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me
she says do not worry baby this is just my little way
played it straight down the line
and his subjects gathered 'round him
love wo not see my coming
heroes always get the best girl
i know confession is a black empty lie
a big light flashed across the sky
plaiting her hair by the fire woman
a singer must die for the lie in his voice
but somethin' else went slippin' by
what is this feeling that i ca not explain?
and i wo not muck it up
i keep a good friend on videotape
i fear my days are numbered
little me is waiting standing through the night
you are the naked angel in my heart
i will whisper words to ease your shame
god has given you but one heart
i will understand i will i will understand always always
but my love was young and felt
you remind me of the babe
and i might live a thousand years
a mechanized world out of hand
but i like every minute of the day
a man must learn to gently dominate
the lights turned on and the curtain fell down
i am a prisoner here i can never go home
dear god gave me such a life
that old moon sure is shinin' bright
i am not quite right at allam i?
or i will forget how to dream
crawl like spiders on your skin
about someone new in your bed
i will beplaying with my magazine
got me a big wave ride me a big wave got me a big wave
hear they were the golden times
why i have felt this way
i would like to beat on your drum
i was so easy to defeat i was so easy to control
they positively glow glow huh oh
when the smoke had blown away
maybe if you say it you will mean it
take this bread and take this wine
she offers me tibetan tea on a flower tray
i watched them go 'round and 'round
in a sea of honey a sky of honey
life goes on it gets so heavy
well i am talking to you baby
we were working secretly for the military
do not whore your little bodies
as the spider of time is climbing
not today as i move myself out of your sight
he needed peace he needed light
and all that you held sacred
like it or not we were built tough
these rotten people sure know how to live
with the sleep still in your eyes
the hallways are all mocking me
organized his few things his coat and keys
never ask me to come into this barn again
and then to her i will be true
and i am there for you
grandma and i had to leave so fast
i fly in the sky dont you?
you walked over to your woman your pale distracted love
i have got some money with me
they have ferried them out of the past
his throat it trembles when he sings
there are clowns in the night
it is a drive-in saturday yeah yeah
it comes along once in a while
ah the moon is too bright
i am listening to the sound of someone is tears
[with] the fishes and the frogs
yeah i am gonna get fired
well she is a tongue twisting storm she will come to the show tonight
we are nothing and nothing will help us
words and music by bob dylan  special rider music
where i have got to lie down with you soon
of letting go do you know what i mean
she hit me right between the eyes
of all the wheels in ivory town
reaches for her 'till his mind becomes blood hot
you who stand above them now
should not be gone for very long
by the summer it was healing
i am not proud of what i do
the moon blinds my eye with opal cataracts
dog-boy atlas man-drake the geeks the hired hands
he is got to walk a fine line
pass me that lovely little gun
in unhappy rows up to the gates of the garden
said i ca not go on not in this way
or look away look away look away
that is how i liked you best
last i saw he was out there waiting
i do not remember the faces
the saddest damn man in the entire human race
this garden is our home dear
but he is not well at all
so she arranged a place to go
oh where did they come from? stormed my room!
but i have no shape or form
and i ca not wait to tell you to your face
if the sun would lose its light
they slip between the sentries of the heart
you know the feeling when you are on the right track
what a tale my thoughts could tell
just a puppet on a lonely string
boo hoo hoo boo boo hoo
and i will never be set free
the way i used to go
oh oh i have i have been in one place too long
they do not push do not crowd
it is a question of trust
we have come to bring you home
and i felt like getting high
and give him all your stripes and ribbons
i would walk a thousand miles
sometimes i wonder does an angel die?
i was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar is bash
torn to pieces by her long-fingered hand
smile the way it was before
and the knowledge that they fear is a weapon to be used against them
but for you it is down to
i guess i recognize your destination
it came up on the horizon
i am not gonna call you again
i can help myself do not talk to me
love do not know if you are black or white
i do not like your fashion business mister
one wrong word and you are out of sync
and we generate a reason for not
and no one knows why the wine is flowing
sorrow is child you follow after
have a drink they are buying
taking pictures that i do not want to see
jump magic jump jump magic jump
sometimes i forget all i will regret
you are the coward who points the finger
do not even pause and ask them why
but weak enough not to choose it
i have got my own moral compass to steer by
show me slowly what i only know the limits of
every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
listen now it is a wonderful life
he only introduced me to a wider reality
and hang it on a thorn
we can watch it and stay and we can listen
with tremblin' hand i turned toward her
and there is nothing to say
we are all deserving something more
that is walking on hallowed ground
now i like every minute of the day
concerned and caring help the helpless
sorry is the fool who trades his love for hi-rise rent
could put right what i got wrong
pull over and put the top down
if it is gonna rain down it can rain on me
macky how much did you charge?
i would set the wheels in motion
i kept waving my arms till i could not see
that this ai not exactly real
but i am up here holding on
drifting drifting along drifting drifting along
a shred of light a particle away
i do not need to believe all the dreams you conceive
i turned and walked the hallways
sliding sideways in a rusty old ford
i will always be here for you
i will be wearing a river is disguise
carbon copies from the hills above the forest line
tomorrow is dance tomorrow is dance
ca not turn around no ca not turn around no oh no
ca not help but wonder where and who she is
the first guest in was a bumblebee
it is your flesh that i wear
it is an invitation across the nation
all my best changes were there
think small with the fire gang it is the only way
from the sky like an angel la-la-la
oh but i could not really stammer out a word
some wish some will go to hell is inferno
as the heart and mind collided
trust me rusted minds refuse to go
because i am still in love with you
i will be what i could be
we go out in the world and take our chances
my tongue is tied and my body aching
will i walk the long road? the long road cannot stay the long road
leave it all and like a man
but there is really nothing much to say
and where where is my gypsy wife tonight?
and the blessings come from heaven
and i just want to be there when the lightning strikes
we add to each other like a coral reef
she will touch you with your mamma is hand
up on the side of this mountain of mine?
i was scared i was scared
ooh babe i said i am coming
they are almost falling over you
we can move with savage grace
carry me away on his steed
and the ways of hard-knock school
sometimes the spirit is too strong
but what good would drugs be
will be there while i am gone
just to see if you care
this time i know no song
i at the tobes of hades
though i never knew you at all
hold the red star proudly high in hand
and if there is something you would like to do
though i know in my heart
now the swan it floated on the english river
i once was blind but now i see
who write their names in peace
i am never so high as when i am with you
and tell what you have to tell
are words lost on the wind
we will i will be fine i am only screaming in my head
tell you what i am feeling
this is my life this is my chance
no i do not want to battle from beginning to end
bow down and cry i am the black messiah
love dear is strictly for the birds
should rumour of a shabby ending reach you
love wont last too long on broadway
standing by the wall by the wall
i can take it or leave
but i could not find the steps
everybody bleeding to that higgs boson blues
and a seedy shot of jed on a motorcycle
but we both just could not stop laughing-it seemed so funny to us
i will be waiting in line
you are an angel when you sleep
there is more to the picture
chained to oar and the night and the wind that blowed
glad that i ran into you
oh and i am pushin' i am being pushed from above
is that i love you so
does everything stop when the old tape fails?
do not you know there is something inside your hand yeah
that is all i can say baby
i ai not out here alone
tonight is the night of the flight
we slip and slide as we fall in love
bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees
speaking words of wisdom let it be
and a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares
one glow of hope and dignity
i say where was my head?
you gotta hold onto something in this life
i need it oh so bad
i am scared of mirrors in case it is me
and he plucked a gentle note
is it ever gonna ever gonna change again?
all we ever look for a god
she do not stand a chance of getting anywhere at all
we have got nothing to fearbut fear itself?
i lose connection as they let me down
strings of street lights even stop lights
cabin fever! o o o' cabin fever!
it is four five six seven
prettiest eyes i have ever seen
like riding on a fast train
for all the ones who come
i am down on my knees
then you know that i will be gone
eventually you will fall for her
try to make you believe in all of his lies
i say its funny how things go
the music will never let me blow away you-oo
and i make me a pot of opium tea
sometimes love is not the love we dream of
i know i was a man who worked a night shift
yes i asked yes i asked
it is really just a question
you are the blessed we are the spiders from mars
that i am not love come to play
the sky hangs heavy with rain
although no one hears a sound
i like to look through your things
she nursed him there ooh over a night
whispering low thar i love her
there may be no tomorrow now
and landing on the logs and i
i wave to the policemen but they do not wave back
for you i am dying now
but i am young enough to remember the future
looking around in the here and now
it breaks my heart to admit it
when you are living on your belly and the enemy are city-births
it happens here in this house
then i am lost and no one can find me
can we still walk side by side
from the tower at saint mary is
fly by me on the desert
you brought me down to earth
and the future makes no sense
once we were lovers can they understand?
i am just looking for looking for a friend looking
who will breathe a sigh of relief
to cast aside your loss and all of your sadness
the corner of your eyes i long forevermore
if you are looking for a reason
reduce us down to witless punks
you said do not worry do not you worry darling
skin on skin but there is heaven in
you know we are havin' good days
too many problems and not one thing
and i think my head is glowing
yeah everybody is got a bomb
and no one there to hold me
clinging to the wreckage of the lost ship fantasy
i do not have an explanation
well tell him he is to come and rescue me
well i have been where you are hanging i think i can see how you are pinned:
and oooooohhhh! here we go again
still the fire of love is true
but none could grow my bail
oh you are in your own world let is see the whole world
a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
flyin' mother nature is silver seed
what you say about his company
let me steal this moment from you now
and i am gone like i am dancing on angels
there is gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow
i need you to carry my children in
get me on my feet get some direction
the words you read the songs you sing
i will need a miracle to help me this time
a vision from the angel wars
to lead the life that we once knew
and they say they take me home
i had not seen his face
saying 'well here we are again'
leading me on towards a change of heartheart
you have been living in my dead soul
leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
i ca not help but imagine you
you know so much it is making you cry
and i sleep with the light on in case she comes
and with a toss of her curls
you are the girl that i love best
than perish with the sad men
with a sign tacked to the side
all this time we are living and trying to understand
some get made and some get sent
now his leg is whittled right down to a splinter
if i could slow it all down
oh and it is the part
if you must roll that rock alone
there is garbage in honeys sack again
you jumped into your gemini i jumped into mine
call it true call it true love
do i look for those millionaires
it is christmas time in the city
yet it was for me not you i
other little thing you gotta do
like pain like the tears on my face
maybe i am in the black maybe i am on my knees
no i ca not pass this time of day
am i afraid of the truth i do not know
they say there are strangers who threaten us
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
i know somehow i should have been warned
until one night he took a skinning knife
i have nailed shut the windows and locked the doors
some people are marching together and some on their own
and fill this tiny cup of mine
but when the morning breaks they are swept away by
oh please can you help me?
push to the left back to the right
when i walked away from you
let the fluency set it down
she stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon
i call you by your name
til suddenly the little toy soldier spring went
lie back and let me unlock you
i could call you up from anywhere
i was healed and my heart
he picks up scraps of conversation
close me in the dark let me disappear
he is comin' home empty he is barely afloat
and you are never going to hit the floor
and i have not been getting anywhere
if i was a candle and you was a moth
this is not even worth a point of view
and there are no letters in the mailbox
do not bother me leave me alone
what kind of meaning in a gun shot
i will go down to bill is bar
and said 'this is a bust'
how long can this go on?
get ready for love! get ready!
miley cyrus floats in a swimming pool in toluca lake
oh ooh what do we do
i was listening to my breathing
as they are turning down the lights
she was led away bewildered and amazed
some games are hard to lose
a love of violence and dread of sighs
angels we must do what we must do!
stored for you in a giant battery
you do not get something for nothing
tell me what you are singin' baby say party
are we gettin' something out of this all-encompassing trip?
and i love you now there is nothing left
that they had been deserted from above
i said hey little girl where do you hide?
and the sound of her name
he will remember this day for the rest of his life
it makes you feel so good
you know i have been away
open their eyes to the beauty
it is a long hard road when your friends start to leave you behind
so i hang from the ceiling
or you will find yourself outside
try to make sense of my inner rage
you have to reach inside no feelings to hide
with chains upon my feet the story always ends
if i have got someplace to go
you ca not hear what i am saying to you
feeling cocky and strong ca not let you go
i will give you whatyou are not supposed to have
ah it is my favourite hygiene it is the confidence i need
she do not want to lose me
you are free to change your mind
like some pilgrim who learns to transcend
you flow around all that comes in your way
his brains all down his head
and i planted my bolo knife in the neck
though my memory has a second-sight
rise in anger fall back and repeat
i will answer this when i get home
i like it i like it
they laid his head on a newspaper
they waste no time waiting for the snow
and i must find another role to play
ohna na nalet my love open the door
cry cry cry cry cry cry
i do not like what happened to my sister
and he is coming up behind in his long
guess i will put all my eggs in a postmodern song
o mary you have seduced my soul
let it be let it be
they are gonna whip her up like a helicopter
and planets and comets with tails blazin'
i am close but ca not enjoy
from the depths of my emptiness
they will be tearing us apart moving us to mars
but i have got to get going so much that i wanted to do
we could have been lost we would have been saved
bolan and moony are heading the show tonight
befriend the glorious end of the line
now i am not saying who was right or wrong
further back and forth a wave will break on me today
and to this day she is glided on
well most of all nothing much
when it all began in the dying days of a war
he is in a hotel where they all go
oh and a brother back to back to back
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
we are glass we are glass
you better hang on to yourself
oh and it hurts like heaven
the rest can go to hell
dance magic dance magic ooh ooh ooh
the waves would lash about us
is not so easy where you are from
with my knuckles dragging through the mire
i see your colors and i am dying of thirst
scored some friends along the way
i had been there now i am hiding all way
the cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas
and we search high and low without
it will surely help us along
and a weary moon dangles from a cloud
so spill your breakfast and drip your wine
they told me i was going to lose the fight
just want to get it right sometimes
as they are rocking in the breeze
i have been blessed with the power to survive
i see you walking down the street with her
leave the hatred on the cross
all of the potions from oysters to seducing smiles
he is in the best selling show
i am the one who died for you
all that you feel is tranquillity
i am cured when you are all alone
gonna find her some money honey
and the red tide kisses the shore
we can beat them just for one day
the lake a lady is mirror
stay as you are the darkest star
year by year month by month day by day
the earth beneath us starts to tremble
i flicker like an old film - black white
if we need too much attention
the cleaners are coming one by one
you want to leave it up to you
i would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer
work it down  the ground say party
she took unto herself most everything her lover lost
gonna have fun in the city
all the stars fade from the night
we can fall from rockets' red glare
everybody made a movie everybody had one line
what is got the whole world fakin'? x
yeah i loved you all my life
i do not need opinions and rumours
she makes me feel like an old man
do not know a thing about tapping in on wires
find you are swimming into completely different oceans
the thinker sits alone growing older
c amon c amon you say party
i want to feel your innocence
i have got to fight the law
do not shine all the time
oh my love let us unpin you
their looks suggested that i have lost my mind
you move like you are walking on this ice
hey baby the hour is late
i swallow my face just to keep from biting
coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
is a place to hide the pain
with their hearts on the bible
oh please do not send me out
that is one more kid that will never go to school
a world war can be won
say a prayer for the cowboy
then lie down in the bitter gutter moon
if the food gets you leery
the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle
those christmas lights keep shining on
just look around and you see
you do not hear what i am saying do you?
i wish that i was home instead
you will never see a sign hanging on the door
trying to pave the way for the third world man
i need you like a drug to keep my fill
with a dollar bill in my hand
viii never turn your back on a monster!
break up the floor break up mad tours
do not you hear this wasted cry life is over you
they wipe out an entire race and i have got to write it down
and the days they linger on yeah
dom do aaah pour me out another phone
underbelly inside of me rejoice and follow thee
i touch her here and there i know my place
i feel a-tragic like i am marlon brando
entwined together in this culture of death
speed jive do not want to stay alive
my mind wants to cry out loud
life has nothin' to do with
ah you hate to see another tired man
oh no oh no sister and brother
a hellish night a ghostly light
shattered windows and the sound of drums
it was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
hey i wo not change direction and i wo not change my mind
but there is more to come my boy
down on the coastline highway one
there is a crack in the world
send in pain send in lies
rims so mean and so extreme
get back! do not reach out!
when you do not believe i am here?
i am further away than before
this is my day to be free
and at the streets are rising and you would rather sing
my life is work to the friends i make
i ca not even find anything worth stealing
looked down into the house of mary
how to avoid defeat when truth and fiction meet
but i am the resurrection babe
i have seen your trick of blood your trap of fire
it ought to be second nature
we were always meant to always meant to
when they tremble for the knife
thank you chief i sure would
no you are not ready for me
just a whisper whisper whisper whisper
down in new orleans in new york city
was it me said you were crazy?
when you are born a lover
what a tale your thoughts could tell
i love the sound of laughter
an empty shell seems so easy to crack
i am not renowned for my restraint
i have got twelve disciples and a buddha smile
i feel like an empty cast iron exhibition
we ca not dance we do not talk much we just ball and play
ooh she does too much to me
with my head stuck under the sand?
the sands of time were falling
here am i in my little bubble
so you have come back for jennifer
just you try and stop me
leave me down here on my own
they do not have to say a thing
your face your race the way that you talk
catch the mystery catch the drift
why do not you come on back to the war before it hurts us
gone gone the water is all gone
i am still confusing love with need
it is my turn to drive
of the mouth of the valley of the whadow of death
i am so sick with pain
why did you have to make me feel that?
oh little spider climbing out of a broken jug
to our love a valentine of blood
i love you too in all your forms
sharks puffed for fish and whales
you are like that big big star he is tore the town apart
in a world of curiosity beyond the imagination
the wind circles among the trees
there is more of what she told
were written on the studio wall
approach her you ape with your tail on
someone must have said that slow him down
call them the diamond dogs call them call them
just look through your window look who sits outside
take your best stab at the beast
but by then it would be winter
the night falls at your feet
the act of love was slowly pounding
i do not need to be forgiven for loving you so much
you have got to find yourself alone
tap my pretty little feet tap my pretty little feet
the whole third floor of the hotel gutted by the blast
do not it take you down home?
lift up their eyes while they pray
and all your shirts and jeans and things
we are planets to each other
all of the doubts and the certainties
oh so long marianne it is time that we began
you will beg at the end
i heard telephones opera house favorite melodies
how much difference does it make how much difference
got no money no place to stay
for they knew not the words of the free states' refrain
yet we will go no more a-roving
there is really no way of knowing
just tell me what it is that you want
well those were the last words that the barkeep said
but time is on your side
in the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
and when the heat came down it was left on the ground
to build the best big stick
i know what she is thinking
i have no time for the chitter-chatter ladies
are the crumbs i have left behind
here the ladies always ring twice
inside your head i am singing
that is how you think of love
is the view i have always taken
i think it is time for us to realize
oh god you needed the leading role
the bad seeds performed cindy regularly in their live sets in  and
i have always been a coward
do not put your blues where your shoes should be
steer your life by these stars
to watch her groaning in the dirt
oh i am in love with egypt
a real possibility that i may meet you in my dreams
saying when will she summon me
are all you seem to get from me
yeah so friday is gonna pay
you are hung up on the line
it is all you lived for
or is that someone at your door
though we may be the last in the world
and i thought well as well him as another
birds came flying from the underground
with the roar of their jokes
and our homeless dreams go back to the street
for the latest tipfor the latest dream
do not know the reason why i
johnny is in america uh-uh-uh uh uh uh-uh uh-uh-uh
ai not indicative of my place left the porch
while i come running i do not know why
late night big town police shake down
for the sword outwears its sheath
we can walk our road together
why then we would see the forest for the trees
i am not trying to make a difference
like they do it in the factory
they say that they can tell
we are part of a bigger plan
watch your truck you might get stuck
'cause it is so deep you do not think that you can speak about it
and wonder what you are doing tonight
your lies are written down now
i should be crying but i just ca not let it show
you live and you die in the blink of an eye
when i knew was easy the darkness was the price
now as i am coming for you
one year from now the entire world is about to detonate
every chance every chance that i take
did you see him did you see him?
i come down from the crooked mansion
yes you know that the hardest part
and our seven years go by like one
was loving her such a crime
she will turn softly in her sleep and call my name out low
please forgive wo not you dear?
heaven can you see what i see?
there are those who think that life
old man sitting in the white sand
there is a poor little lambie
so i will just lie alone and wait for the dream where i am not ugly and you are
only i could bring you downwhy do i
ai not got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines to hang me up
why do not you come on back to the war ca not you hear me speaking?
lord i think you would overdose if you knew what is going down
the games are still the same i see
when i was a river dried up
where the air is not clean
can a heart-beat can a heart-beat
you know i hate to see you cry
do you think that they care if they are real woman?
that you should do it the same
my heart will lie beside you
no one else that is free
i will be your bearer soon love on some cotton doom
your face just ghostly in the smoke
they say i make you suffer for my sins
to tell me that i lie
we do not need to escalate
it is okay oh would i ever let you down? no way
ah they are shutting down the factory now
we raise our hats to the hand a-moulding us
between the newsreel and your tiny pain
i need love love love love love yeah
we can be us just for one day
now suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
that is my kind of highroad gone wrong
you are getting up in the morning and put on your suit [ca ']
and says 'i have thought of you too'
from bitter searching of the heart
i heard the sound i turned my head around
some bloo-bottles glowin in his gruel
leonard cohen - hey that is no way to say goodbye
daddy is getting wood with the barnyard cat
like a little soldier catching butterflies
was my darling the dog chair
i am in a glass house
feeling no fear of leaving their bodies here
i am living in the doghouse
and threw them on the ground
the price of love the price of love
he do not drive no cadillac
by tight lipped condescending mommy is little chauvinists
once he had a name now he plays our game
the keys to make them sound differently as i struck the
and if you have got to sleep
oh the women tear their blouses off
ada got a gold mine x
you know you can hear me
been walking home a crooked mile
ooh there is thunder in our hearts
au courant fugitif to the fleeing current
well i was only a kid cruising around in a trance
i will listen to the darkness sing
they will be dancing dancing in the street
two birds is what they will see
stealing in and out back alleys
tie my hands above my head
jigging along with the fiddle oh johnny
that is what jazz is to me
it must be an open door for you
my heart is thrown to the pebbles
let is go out and feel the night
cause the value would be shot
she lives in my blood and skin
to the ends of the earth
just like a photograph i pick you up
work all of my days for this kind of praise
of the touch of your hand
been trawling too long i have been losing out strong
i am writing you now just to see if you are better
get me off the streets get some protection
and tomorrow means the same to me
i guess i am just somebody who
love how could they know love
now we just ca not move?
you do not have to be on your own
i am not looking for a clearer conscience
you know it gets to us all
i am lost i am no guide but i am by your side
all the precious moments cannot stay
they say the storm will be coming back
when these days have passed long ago
in a world where everybody fucks everybody else over
i am so high i hold just one breath here within my chest
what are you trying do not even tempt me
on thursday she hock all a my clothes
in all the places where i have seen you shine boy
there is many that you will see
she will be there to wave to you
all of a sudden she was on my mind
and as they usher me off to my end
and i am on my way back down again
we can rise and fall like empires
i i can see the danger signs
and just when i am about to get my hands on her
that the truth is not the truth?
supplement queen your colours may fade
and your body is a fire
tell me where is your husband?
i ca not see the bridge
yes i will speak from my heart
sends a nervous shiver down my spine
of this old heart beating for you
people stared at the makeup on his face
you can run you can run tell my friend willie brown
see me at the next thing text ring
ever since you have been gone
you know she takes a little care
fugitive fathers sickly infants decent mothers
if i did not have your love to make it real
you take me to and lead me through babylon
then she closed those baby blue eyes
un canadien errant a wandering canadian
i have opened up my eyes
bored and disgusted to do us down
lucy ca not dance but she knows what the noise can do
sharp pain every single night- every day i fight a hopeless fight
moon tell me make it alright
i could not even take you home
a-bombs h-bombs even very small ones
oh and i am just waiting 'till the firing starts
at night the sea lashes the rust red ramparts
hey but that is alright i do not care
so i will dance my life away
i know i am asleep but i know this is real
and humiliate that american captain kennedy
she is been gone such a long time longer than i can bear
but i feel the things you say
stand here until i fill all your heart is desires
in which my thoughts would drown
you have got it made with the rest of the toys
there is a star in the sky
the day i learned to swim
if what she said was heaven sent
and i wanna be your man
she is nobody is baby now
he is been takin' too much on
truth is false and logic lost
it is the best mistake he could make
'the oaks are just too greedy
seek reward in the ever after
i get the feeling i am not driving
it only goes up to your knees
i loved her then and i guess i love her still
but they long for the light of your touch
it is no cause for concern
she could be the one who is going to save you
there is nothing in our eyes
oh now boy what you been and done
you said do not worry do not worry darling
i know i could be good for you
the year of the diamond dogs
there is one born every minute
and open your mouths that is all
time flies when you are having fun
when a unit was a figure not a she
the senoritas crying at the well
steer your heart precious heart past the women whom you bought
try to get past it but not too far past it
we are linked to one another
and you are the best girl i have ever had
i may just slip right by you
'cause i do not care if you are going nowhere
when you hear the band playin'
i will never see such arms again in wrestling or in love
and there is a rumor that you are on ice
i did not have the cash
as you are taking me home
where i am bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
crossed lines i should not have crossed
how i suffer the sweetest condition
this square foot of sky will be mine til i die
all i know is that sometimes you have to be wary because sometimes the target
i saw a young girl who did not die
do da do do da do
it is coming through a crack in the wall
and ai not it fine ai not it wild
a london boy a london boy
there is a town in north ontario
use the key unlock the door
that is the way that lady luck dances
i think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
concrete underground cast out everyday the dregs of society
hey i am gonna take it all--
but i ca not deny the way i feel
you can buy a home of your own
she whispers 'is not it odd
you were in it for your beauty too
think it up and start again 'gain 'gain
though i campaigned all my life
what if i got it wrong
or as 'sydney' i think the bad seeds often sang 'come on home sydney cindy'
somehow it is the biggest things
i take a deep swallow in my frustration
gotta get a word to elizabeth is father
ca not take away the sorrow now
where you promised to stand guard
cast away upon the open sea
that when all is lost there will be you
you caught me kneeling at your sister is door
back on the street i saw a great big smiling sun
all of us are done for
a chance to strike me down
and my tears are falling rain
i guess the carny ai not gonna show
well i did not know who were
all i want to do is see you
and this cross is your heart
that is not so easy to be
i do not believe in i can go on
'hey you which way is down'
when we talk we talk to you
and i loved you for your body
beggar out of the joy of your marriage feast
harm is in us but power to arm
your beauty lost to you yourself
conform to uniforms of some corporate entity
wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?
you win a while and then it is done
there is no time to cry
i would rather run but i ca not walk
said farmer emmerich to the ape
and i have been running on fire
can you wipe your nose my child
help me baby! help me baby! talk to me! listen to me
so set up the ten pins
let me grab your soul away
joe is awful strong bet your life he is putting us on
back to back back better back off
and when the gate goes up
you looked so beautiful in the rising heat
i make a right after the arches stinking grease and bone
and the storm i walk toward
and what costume shall the poor girl wear
once she lay open like a road
i tried to explain i hope this works somehow
yes i am taking to the rain
will she be there? is my piccolo on straight?
just when things seem so paperparrent like my toothface? like my out-do?
oh it is gonna be the way you always thought it would be
and she loves me to this day
you let me in behind the lies
that i am nothing on my own
boo hoo hoo boo hoo hoo
untie for me your hired blue gown
there will be blood among the corn
if the moon has a sister
vans parked in the open field
do not cry do not raise your eye
the grunt of unity when he came in
says life is what you make it
getting in mood for a mombassa night flight
will tell you i am wise to
well i did my best to bring her back
when i get home i am gunna pack 'em up again
oh my did not i say come in?
the saints are drunk howling at the moon
love and life i will divide
will be chasing cars in doggie heaven
they will see my work in a different light
i tried to satisfy her worried mind that is what i did
and your holy ghost and priest
everyone the human company draws close
lord i am gonna die blues
i can almost lay my hands upon
and i do what i am told
and it is me they are lookin' for
save for a voice on the traveling wind
i ca not see the look in its eyes
in a world of nuclear devastation doom and deteonation
no short haired yellow bellied son of george porgy is
what you gonna say this time
and i will get that message home
life has really only just begun
the fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs
or love as a mystical state
so kiss close all your wounds and call living life a day
lost in a world of my own
we will take a taxi to the show
i was there when you wanted me least
shake it up shake it up
people are basically the same basically the same
there is radar in my heart
i just ca not get it through my head
i could not bear to return
they will be tearing us apart
of which i am nearly wholly innocent you know
i should not have let you go
and i could write a song
i feel a silent scream begin inside
and one of them is mine
dream the fisherman in his boat
and you climbed the twilight mountains
we have all got problems of our own
we will find the solution is
a man must build a fortress to defend
i am crazy for trying and crazy for crying
so all you critics sit alone
or throw them into the street below
keep all your fantasies that is all we are
as you mean to go on as you mean to go on
i could not find a light
eyes tell me turn it around
the morning light do not show you near
you will be begging us please
i am relying on your common decency
the gospel according to pat hewitt
wo not be back to start all over
put my hands up to the sky feeling inside
you said it would last but i guess we enrolled
is there someway out of here?
there was meaning but she sold him to the state
these boys do not know when to push
in the orchard my english rose
shake it baby c amon shake shake it baby
i got a problem i ca not explain
well i ca not make you dance
i was staring at the face of rage
tho' you are singing somewhere still
o come with me my little one we will find that farm
and she says drink deeply pilgrim
the cities in the land all extend a welcome hand
chilly down with the fire gang wooh
and wet with tears and good-byes her hair of deepest black
the mother and the father the daughter and the son
gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
we thought it was all over
do not tell no news on me
and we do not know what to do
but both of us know you must stay
child you are a woman now your heart and soul are free
not to read the warning signs
or the devil against the fool
rolled a cigarette for which he asked for a light
on the floor of the ocean
from underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
do not think it over it always takes you over
it went woof woof woof woof woof
always try'n' to put us down
and if she stayed with me
and i am so tired of it
do you want it? [repeat: x]
but it is my turn to drive
get lost and then get found
but they will never ever find that cure for love
and the pieces will lay there a while
listen baby let me lie low lie low with you
their faces always seem so pale
fills his mind with the thought of a girl
and we can watch this damn thing turn
wish you could help me mister
a body in heaven and a mind full of dirt
though it was not hand in hand?
if you do not let me down
for they are breathless over you
spinning like a whirlwind of leaves
you ditch it all to stay alive
i am yearning i am burning
long as she wears that plain gold ring
no not with one thousand keys
why would you want to hurt me? oh
but if they do just tell them it was me
arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
than training these guns on those men in the sand
still ca not find a trace
must not give the game away
for all will come before me
and all i have said was just instead of
do you think you are ready for me?
and watch an angel bleed for me
so let me judge your love affair
i knew what i was letting myself in for
of schizophrenic egocentric paranoia prima donnas
he only gave us the good things
or did you did you did you
when you got me lost for words
and if we would get up off our knees
for me and you me and you
and your sky be baby blue
i saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand
beating so fast in search of new dreams
i got a problem that is so intense
from shooting stars to stars 'n' stripes
like blood like wine in the darkroom scene
did you did you did you
and i sleep with the light on in case she
you are faithful to the better man
these pieces are broken like i say
and she is been on the wing
please forgive and let me share with you around the bend
i am gonna kill that woman
he should bow his head in shame
from bed to sink and back again
i will just speak in slow motion
your daddy is leavin' home today
the only thing in my mind
you wo not hear me crying
all the inventors could never design
when she was just a girl she expected the world
you came along and you cut me loose
to say i got you bad
sun keeps beating down on me wall is a mile high
are left to die on the diamond
wipe that tear from your eye
or that love is like the smoke
sometimes on the way into town we would say:
she is wearing them bloo-stockens ah bet!
like a moth on love is bright light
you do not know what he is after
lie awake for half the night
though in life i used to hug her
for each is concerned with their immediate need
i was very lonely till i met you on sunday
something is gotten into my life
i travel ever onwards to your land
everybody knows it is coming apart
you will dance to my tongue
i used to be on an endless run
there is a sailor who is born
and a voice came so brightly
i was just a boy when i sat down
we stand awed inside a clearing
look back in anger see it in my eyes
did you know that i do not hide
we got so much to be happy about
all i know is that memory can be too much to carry
i am the disease and the cure
i do not know what you mean
bad hep with the fire gang a smile a day keeps the doctor away
not to be seen in the town again
they come out when the coast is clear
i told you babe you are no good
we will find somewhere the streets are paved with gold
love is what we came here for
when you are head over heals and the magic is there but impossible
tried all kinds of working out miracle goodnight
even in your arms i know
must i forget the things i knew
ca not tell the bullshit from the lies
he is old enough to know what is right
well i have been bound and gagged and i have been terrorized
there will be a new day
in fact a burden lifted from my soul
i was dying when we met
never turn your back on mother earth
oh the sisters of mercy they are not departed or gone
in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
i ca not take nothing home
cool and remote like dancing girls
i will sing a song from the film that broke your heart
and you know i wo not forget
sweet wine and soft relaxing lights
there is a big fire over on the north of the city
but they keep bringing out the dead now
the saint is turning to sin
is what i am trying to achieve
or maybe i am a ghost
gone going for it all this time gone
in a long black veil she cries on my bones
darkness gives way to light a new way
run outside in the desert heat
do not you wanna curve away
there was a solemn man who watched his twilight disappear in the sand
i could tell you of horror
and i think that i have to show you
led by blind faith and trust
now the song is nearly over
what did i do? what could i do? what did i do?
when you are out of the blue and into the black
i ca not give them away
oh a refuge for the coming night
'til all that is wrong will
he said i am gonna buy this place and burn it down
it is the dark night of my soul
now my back is on the line
it is your turn my beloved one
we used to stand around on corners
it is a motion that swings the sky
but it is so easy to do
convinced me that i had no way to win it
let me be weak let me sleep
was known to make more money than any bitch in town
what do you say? god what do you say?
do not let the vengeance of heaven be you
i get paid by a ten year old
they feel he should get some time
there is nothing more i need
and pity in the room like iodine
see i have been watching a television of um in the homelands
do you love me? i love you handsome
like the day i learned to swim
but i do not call soft enough
he was eating up a lady where the lions and christians fight
she wears a dress of red and gold
entriggering traps for a gross gang of ghost types
there is something appears in the way
indeed on a tv appearance as well i have a version of elvis presly doing this
i raise my arm against it all and i catch the bride is bouquet
the us of a the united states
one day i feel i am ahead of the wheel
it is just a matter of instinct
i used to walk on clouds
that is how it is - how it is going to be
his life was fun and his life was full of joy
on all these burning hearts in hell
and who in her lonely slip who by barbiturate
if you need something to blame
hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi
it is a plank in me eye
i know i am not your lover
there is gold in them hills
sa petite main joue dans mon coeur
there is nothing else that bugs me
at your picture and love you and love you
i am goin' i am goin'
he had no living relatives but his wife-who never showed
i want to be up on the roof
so we rode down to the river where the toiling ghosts spring
buzz said 'what a wild sensation'
i am trading stories with the leaves instead yeah
ma-ma-many an aborigine is mistaken for a tree
and a wheel on the track
thoughts fly back to the breakup
into the mercy seat i climb
i who am on a pedestal
she breathed in the future by breathing out the past
but first he was stripped and then he was stabbed
and i swear i waited and waited
the spray that is torn away
move out i do not need a reason
i have got my secrets you have only got the sleeping sun
i saw the book fall from your hands
ah they are shutting down the factory now
when he says that he loves me
give me the banshees for bvs
when you called she was always there [repeat: x]
then wash up my hands in the gully and the moon
and i hope that you die
sooner or later darling you are gonna get eaten
all systems check t minus nine
a vision vague or not raising a frightful wake-you-up
and the trees all nod their heads they are agreed
account the addups till do-nots are we balanced? we are in business!
if i put faith in medication
the stars to the west the south the north and to the east
one desire i ask of you
who run and cast their doubts
i was born to run run run
well i have been sliding down on rainbows
and i fought every man for her
dream up dream up let me fill your cup
the things we would like to be
he went down to missy mousie is door
in a parallel universe that is happening right now
but a spirit with a vision
i love her and i always will
i cannot stop to comfort them
the streets is monster the streets is tonka
and when god comes for me
this time it is your decision
everything will turn out for the best
but right now right right now right now i am a-roaming
see my one love talking to the pretty boy
what am i going to do
i smile when i am angry
oh i think i landed in a world i had not seen
i rise up her girl-child lumps and slipping knots
oh i will stand arms outstretched pretend i am free to roam
checked your hands and studied the lines?
do not die my silly little baby!
i never thought i would need so many people
and make the dream come true
all your sheep and your lillies of snow
and the trees are all kept equal
through the spooky wood looking for her
i could call and make you crawl into bed
there plunged the rays of love
you do not know what you mean to me
i heard it in my sleep
he and she are in the house
the glorious union well it could be love
still i ca not close my eyes
do not turn on the lights you can read their address by the moon
i love you now there is nothing left
the case had been tried by the jury inside
come up and be a kite
in your fire and in your flood
bake some bread he is leatherman
that music is all that he is got in his life
we could steal time just for one day
is still there in your heart
surprisingly good to be moving around
that i was meant for rambling and would easy go astray
she strikes me down with a fist of lead
and i know she is living there
i was not walking on water
one cold winter we went down south
though i eat from tins i am healthier
you get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your
i had a few cheap thrills
take things slow you can crack
he buys a gun and steals a car
we are proud of who you are
when we got to the top of the hill we saw rome burning
you are all dressed in grey
stars have their moment and then they die
your days are all through dying
here a angel lying here to stay
thin skies the man chains his hands held high
how come the night is long?
janey is gone now and she wo not be back no more
floating in a big white balloon
i am unsafe at any speed
with a sparrow of st francis that he was preaching to
it does not make me brighter
i said there is nothing wrong with what you say
the bureau supply for aging men
i am in your garden fading fast in your arms
i remember when you sang that song about today
and the rain it raineth daily
counting on their fingers with crumbs
from the golden light of coming dawn
we can do all the bad things
it is too late to change events
not asking for the ghost to call
my aim is to hit this miss
i will be waiting in line
i will ask you what you are thinking
search for the enemy within your secret human desire
turn my back on what i have left below
is it so wrong to think that
i lay awake at night terrified of school on mondays
why do not you come on back to the war let is all get even
died a long time ago in the s
your whole label break up you out of cake wake up
and now i am lost too late to pray
you are the only one i have ever loved
armed with the spray can soul
i feel like making up for lost time
but through the pain and the suffering
there is a light a special kind of light
i will walk with my face blood
the winter stripped the blossoms bare
he went and stole my heart
whips out a little black pistol
i hear she is opening up the doors to heaven
mysteries of night escape the light of day
if i could not lift the veil and see your face
i want to be with my family
that leaves the mark of cain
could be dead for all you know
bad news is come to town
here is my lap - that is where you lay your head
you draw lightning from the sky
driven to the edge of a deep dark hole
familiar places that we can run and hide
ca not tell your right side from your wrong
and the tree begin to breathe
i caught a glimpse of a god all shining and bright
and it is me i will never survive
open and closed within your eyes
we look to the left and to the right
love like a ghost in the dark
or you better do some walkin' now
or is it just for today
i have seen the future baby
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore
how else are you going to see
i will still remember that day
there will be time for laughing
i have knelt at your feet
or this shallow orb mugged by reality
oh see the world much more than oh
and a part of me is scared
i like some bitch to scare me
and let me die in the memory of her arms
can you dig our groovy feelin'?
the gods of love and reason
for i myself am the pedestal
and jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
so many people think that way
i hope he is being good to you
show your love show your sweet sweet love
reminding me just how close i came to missing
you can see the change you want to
but the little green wheels are following me
the halloween jack is a real cool cat
there are those of us not fit to tie
but it hurts me it hurts me
i have tried in my way to be free
wipe it on your dress and send it to me
so i do not browse around at all
they oughta give my heart a medal
if you are the healer it means i am broken and lame
it is all just inadvertent imitation and i do not mean mine
close the dead eyes of god
there was a girl i used to know
drowned by the props all steely sunshine
you had the grace to hold yourself
i will be waiting up there
one night on the rack and he is back saddling up saturday
so the days float through my eyes
oh i can feel my heart beating
if they find me racing white horses
or a sly touch at times
though we are strangers till now
but i am still afraid to be there
now pay witness to sonny is burning
there is such a sad love
and she will laugh when she reads the part
i will never let ya i will never let ya i will never let you down no way
if what they say around here is true
did i need to place my heart
meteor rain stars across the night
that is a rhythm sweetly tortured
i am carefully trying to steer clear of
that is all right with me
in a world that never stops
i have betta' watch my step or else i will break my leg
dogs that lick and dogs that bitewhy do i
and keep the tower from tumbling
french version of the infant kiss
all i need is your love
the best we can agree on
i feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
a grave waits for you at heaven is gate
in a telescope lens when all you want is friends
but i am afraid to be there
you are not part of it yet
he is on the water wagon
i am told that this is like the vengeance of god
how many years have come and gone
with that feeling of sticky love inside
once upon a time there was a toy soldier with a whip lash in his hand
i used to walk next to you
because i have got a love
she took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine
but they knew they could never tell me
well that is where i belong
ca not be what you want because i am
how many times must another line be drawn?
c amon and let me live girl!
with a lump in his throat and lumpy mush
some things we plan we sit and we invent and we plot and cook up
she loved him yeah she do not want to leave this way
two in one! two in one! two in one!
with their pride in their pants
well maybe the landslide will bring it down
the garden of allah viking valhalla
but my memories they eat me
there is got to be some other way
and i could write a book
by someone i do not know
and i ca not see the water
and the oceans flow in my veins
that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
becomes a sharp and burning sword
my heart ba boom ba boom boom
i am coming back to look for you
there is a price that i pay for my mission
i do not care if you do
i swear this ai not some kind of hoax
we do not like children anyhow
we will go to finchley fair
i would hate to say the farmer
well they give me some beans for my last meal
leather seats and a friend of mine
i am a dead man walking
'i know it is over' icarus says to the sun
i got me a ticket one way to moline
they put your soul on ice
never gonna let me win aw huh
stay low on the ground fire can drive you savage and afraid
trapped inside a night but i am a day and i go
yeah i did everything that i could everything i could
the walking in the dawn to greet the night
i am all on my own my own
from your fingers and your thumb
to walk down by the river is bend
to the girl with the mousy hair
do not let the party grieve
he takes a two smoke walk
and shwdow you are just a gallow that i hang my body from
perched on a beam up there
you will find it again some day
i wo not praise your name
and they all eat in a line
life is sad and so is love
you have got seven i have got one
well i have been waiting i was sure
i want to feel you realize
i see you standing on the other side
now i do not know who i am
the night is young why are we so hung up
i do not believe in praying
i was just a lad nearly twenty two
i would cook him something nice she said but he refuses to wash his hands
the whole world will be different soon
and who by brave assent who by accident
i was pretty good at taking out
what is my price to pay
for you know the time is nigh
her breath was warm against my throat
i am so glad i know what is on your mind
all the time she was silent and still
right where we used to be
now the cloak of night is falling
i am warning you frankie leave on the next train
there is room at the top for private detection
and the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks
if the stars were all unpinned
the brook runs into the river river runs into the sea
lay down your arms and surrender to me
and hold a candle to your high-life disguise
i would rather be a comma than a full stop
you know what it is like and you know you want to go
i have heard the lions hunting
fightin' in the age old battle
i have seen enough of life
i will probably burn in hell
and the stars wash down the sink
with a-n-i-t-a wrigglin free onto skull'n wouldagger
so i crawl back into your open arms
strumming as hard as he did please
girl now i take it for granted
i should wear your old red dress
the first line on the first page
if i would only paid my bill
i wish i could have met you in a place
now you are a substitute teacher
they found a little one inside
is the same as what we have lost
silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
wither million blither tongues mounting bristling guilt frames
ah when you see it then you will understand?
on the magic wings of astral flight
sway through the crowd to an empty space
i like every minute of the day
you call me nancy and i live in moline
buts a sinister blooo lilt into that sing-a-long
well they are just standing there
the nights grow longer the father i go
and he is buried in my life
and long ago she said i must be leaving
judy and he is welcome to his glory
can feel as cold as this
if i can walk an empty mile
he laid his head on a pillow of down
full of all my whispered words her black hair
memory drumming at the heart of an english winter
burned and with both feet on the ground
the lights of the city they only look good when i am speeding
you will never see a sign hung up above your door
spend all day digging my grave
now it begins day after day
then would you come for me?
leaving leaving oh leaving here now
there is already a young fellow but mom and daddy wo not let her leave
you are dealin' with the man
over to stagger lee she starts to flirt
that do not have a number
she put me in the doghouse
all i need is this song for love
oh jesus christ he was not to know
to praise their ways with pupils
we pretend things only happen to strangers
the wrong mix in the wrong genes
just let your feelings roll on by
woken up to be burned burned again
no short haired yellow bellied son of tricky dicky is
you ca not see what is true
hide your ribbons hide your bows
you will be like your dreams tonight
i should be hoping but i ca not stop thinking
run away my son to see it all oh see the world
it is just a job to me
and throw it to the fools
the call comes on the radio
indian summer i hate the heat
you ca not help but wonder
will you give it to be
and i believe in love and wonder
i feel i gotta get up on the roof
are thoughts lost on the way to this
big money got a mean streak
what it is going to be like
tortured while i occupied a man
mister you will be pleased you will see
and they a mountain city raised
oh will you come with us
smiling and waving and looking so fine do not think
fly by plane fly by plane
that man is soul is eternal?
one of these days one of these days
you know i hate to hurt you
could you see the storm rising?
but if you are gonna dine with the cannibals
how do you do da do
in the ghastly fire in soho
do you want to hear something sad?
and we sure was movin' fast
looking for love wo not hold me back
for the words of the profits
i am not trying to say
but she just did not know that i would really go
and i thought of you and i felt like i was lugging
taking off for what is an obvious fall
you fall in love and you are never gonna turn it back
you did not bet on the dodgers to beat the giants
i have got a girl out there i suppose
here the business always rings twice
i feel the wrench of hard realities
just open up your dainty little hand
'tis here where hell and heaven dance
i am cured when i am by you are side
until they get what they need
i get so angry but i keep my mouth shut
i would give it all up for you
you have watched your father plough the fields with a ram is horn
empty out your pockets toss the lot upon the floor
next the walls were closed on me
oh the light that you left me will everglow
if i ai not if i ai not got you
we do not back down from no trouble
while their heads are busy lying low
and at home we are all so guilty-sad
kind of like a wave confused
this i mean to laugh within my mind
if looks could kill they probably will
and that is how i want to end it
but i ca not forget you babe
and though he keeps on taking notes
one mornin' when i was ridin'
i have no need for anymore
o lady with your legs so fine o stranger at your wheel
washed away like footprints in the rain
lay down your arms and love me peacefully yeah
it is a fools gold thunder
'mystery man' god help the bride
celestial machinery - move through your commands
and the devil will take the rest
oh where did the blue skies go?
but no i could not touch her
but they never let you roll the dice
'mystery man' god help the bride!
the riverboat was rockin' in the rain
some were stuffing their faces with caviar
i took from the rolling stones
but when i woke up this mornin'
well her heart was filled with gladness
the winds of changei am stuck beneath the rain
i think i saw you in an ice-cream parlor drinking milk shakes cold and long
he does not have a limousine
like a gypsy forever on the run
now boy is do not start to ramblin' round
you will know what makes the world turn
they all did stand and stare
who do you think you are foolin' now?
but he ai not asked and he do not know
oh yeah yeah yes i will
oh the reason he would be smiling known to him
our little church is painted white
it took it back from me
i ate and ate and ate
but there was nothing left between
i will do anything you ask me to
well i could not see what was to be
the world has got you down
in this town of men with big mouths and no guts
common man he do not stand a chance no
of losing what i used to think was mine
ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread
i am not giving in to security under pressure
they will show us how to break the rules
we rise to play a greater part
you are dying crying i can hear you fall
took my diamond to the pawnshop
i am the king of nuthin' at all
in the depths of my sin
she was laying in a pool right there on the kitchen floor
they kiss they come and they go
and no-one saw the carny go
come loose your dogs upon me
or a write a song nobody has sung
wo not you help me help me
and i had to go and leak it!
hold your head above the ground and they wo not bring you down
i have traveled each and every byway
my whole world turns misty blue
it would not take me long
it never seemed a threat to my masculinity
born of its ever-changing never-changing murky water
i had heard the whispered tales
we are gonna get happy the occasion is right
think small with the fire gang
to tell you where we will meet
in a world lit only by fire
a winter day suddenly came your way
what will you make of my lines
to see the news when i got home
i pity the fool i pity the fool that falls in love with you
from deep behind fifty year old eyes
oh tamper if you like between the doors oh yeah huh huh
then you come and rescue me once again and again
i have lost you now you let me go
all they ever wanted the truth
but i wo not unlock the door
those who can be trusted can change their mind
and he drinks and he drinks
in every place with a name
we are lying by the orange sky
in the secret wells of emotion
lonely things like nights i find
fools and thieves are well disguised
i might sell you my time
the villagers found out that farmer emmerich
so you slide to the floor
is uncertain just like my name
'cause you are all grown-up now
i lay down by the river
and feel some presence there behind
oh the stories they will tell
what we still ca not do today
and you feel like you are going where you have been before
but they have ordered the the moon not to shine
and a dress that is tight
i did not see her fall
i never asked but i heard you cast your lot along with the poor
i will relive it without pain
and let the heavens hear it
the night was cold and vast
no photo by my bedside - check it
well i went out with jenny
or am i part of the disease singing
wrecked up and paralyzed diamond dogs are stabilized
on thursday nobody could blow my bail
you went looking for nur dear
is the lie of your father
but then again those damn clocks they probably wo not
pain is ready pain is waiting
livin' in fear of the wrong decisions
to say it clear to say it cold:
you need the feeling not the man
the red of the sacred heart
my nerves are poles that unfold
do not know where i started from
the cripple on the corner cries out nickels for your pity
but it feels like something dead and cold
the emptiness of summer must begin it
something never thought you would be part of
unaware i am tearing you asunder
love is born with solar flares
and charlie the atlas to the three said
while my heart keeps racing and my mind is consumed
you are only seventeen but you think you have grown
how could i see you and stay too long?
this i guess is to tell you you are choosing out of the rest
you came deep as the ocean
draw the blinds on yesterday and it is all so much scarier
my god just look at me
and single life really has its fine points
big money make a million dreams
and maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
but i do not have no energy
i did not know the girl but i knew her family
fame bully for you chilly for me
so i will spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
well you know that i love to live with you
they say some days up she comes up she rises as if out of nowhere
do not dress in those rags for me
and they are lining up to inspect you
i let my past go too fast
i want to see you dance again
no radio no sound no sin no sanctuary
that is so high and wild
to keep her from the howling wind
new york streets seem to make it worse
try to throw me off my course
you never imagined i could be so wrong
got some if you need it
that is why i am looking
arms wide open with the sea as his floor
without them slotting in your file a photograph?
but we need them of course
to think that things could not turn out worse
it does not belong to you
and heavy-hooded eyes inside her black hair
blood thicker than water will flow
you laughed at what i said
the sign of eth is rising in the air
to find an approach and a way to live
you know you set me free
music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose
the warm glow that lingers on
oh! do not you throw my love away
no one can exists all alone
yeah she is her own disease crying to her doll
why do not you come on back to the war do not be embarrassed
for what is left of our religion
oh that is just the way it was
i would watched the rain claw at the glass
i would bloom red and purple if you would sip out of me
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
there were chains so i loved you
there is nothing down there but me
i am dirty as a glass roof in a train station
a man must learn to rule his tender part
but weak enough to lose it
all that you feel is tranquility
a fear of rear windows and swinging doors
in fact it is cold as hell
well i do not want to be your lover
with her hands on her ears
stab you from the city spires
i was in the wrong place at the wrong time
keeping me waiting keeping me waiting
and it is you i hear so loud and clear
oh here in the moment at hand
and when you are feeling sad
for thursday is child is sunday is clown
we all go quiet as a mouse
what was rotten and what was fresh
i have to hear it from your lips
i am hold you again i will take you
i learned how to raise my voice in anger
all this space i am taking up
that keep on slipping right through our hands
how long do you think before she will go out woman?
halfway there why would you turn around?
if you despise that throwaway feeling
there was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind
i want to be with you have something to share
slap that slap that baby make him free
or i would crawl to you baby
and i will pay it off in blood let i be wed
we have been told we are not afraid of you
and all the drunks pourin' outta the dance halls
i am chained to the old masquerade
i could not feel so i tried to touch
si me das el tequila yo te doy el compas!
she thinks that i was with my friends yesterday
with me now on this island of love running away from all sivilization open
i hope you know it was never to you
it is as good as mine
and we can force you to believe
but time after time after time i tried to tell her so
i wish i would seen the place
but now i have started learning how
we can only grow the way the wind blows
the pain you know so well
can any part of life be larger than life?
even love must be limited by time
he is not afraid of your judgment
i would give you all my love
make way for the cripple creek ferry
it takes some time and trouble
as they try to change their worlds
i am just staying home tonight
i am never going back again
i know it is only for now
then you turned round and walked right out on me
i am not giving up on implausible dreams
where heaven waits those golden gates and back again
the river is swollen up with rusty cans
i saw my baby crying hard as babe could cry
and i do not mean to sound
well the cop made the showdown
drive back to your old town
after spending half his life searching he still felt as blank
and he still gives his love he just gives it away
get me to a doctor is i have been told
you see the world in black and white
and i am not asking you to remember me
but you made everyone and you have been every where
you might think that i am all right
could not leave if i tried
beyond this world strange things are known
i take the - i take the leave for another day
no no tonight i am gonna
i took my mop and bucket
we were not lovers like that and besides it would still be all right
and learn to mend the mess he makes
who on earth can i blame?
and here they take their sweet repast
it is all of these things and more
so walk on barefoot for me
someday i think i will cut him down
you just want to get it right sometimes
the geraniums on your window sill
guess this must be hallu hallucina cina cina cination hmmm
morning sun and you are gone
we have been in love forever
will i see you give more than i can take?
now she walks through her sunken dream
but i walked in light when you held me in that night
it spawns in an empty mind
love will appear and this time will stay
are now in granite laid in granite lake?
but despite all the places i have looked
but the age of miracles had'nt passed
i was no longer on earth
i think of you in motion and just how close you are getting
in a final flash of glory
maybe it is been suggested in some quarters
so i ca not wait here hoping i am something you will keep
i swear i never took it for granted just thought of it now
walk down the street pass to my man pete
did not think i would find the savior in the dark
just what is it all worth
i stayed the night in your arms
more than just the bottom line
down cry me a river dried up and dammed
may well be simple but they are true
friends if you have lost your way
c amon now you say party
and i have seen dream killers
let my love open the door x
does not matter who you are
said she was walking the road of hate
and anyway there was no proof
he sent a letter to a downstat
where do we go from here?
i know when i would not ever touch you
there is no safe seat at the feast
but the way i feel about you
maybe i would give you my world
i was thinkin' about the chamber door
one minute they arrive next you know they are gone
and they seemed to yawn awake her things
do you love me? if you do i am thankful
you have a heart and i have a key
i will say you lied i will say you are lying
this bus it is makin' way too many stops
the sun is rising from the field
wah andy war hol andy war hol he
i am flying out i am flying
where is my outline i start to fade
i need a song to help along
every time i look in his face
you see your baby loves to dance
we stumble and twirl there is heaven in here
to the movers and the shakers
on the left the girl in red so innocent
you looked soaked to the skin
and the wind keeps roaring and the sky keeps turning grey
in fact she will often disagree
those kilometers and the red lights
my london bridge in rain again
walks on his ownwith thoughts he ca not help thinking
just to step on a stair
wo not you come with me
that was floating on the breeze
our experiment in sound was nearly ready to begin
getting near much as he will take
do it myself do it myself do it myself do it myself
but i must stay and find a way
o father look to your daughter
where is mona? she is long gone
i wonder does she looks down as she flies on by
it is like our visit to the moon or to that other star
feel it rising yeah next stop falling
there will be order so give it a good mind
every time i look at it
i am in it where do i stand?
and all the nobody people and all the somebody people
to far outside the wire where my
or i might just stop wanting you
hear my name take a good look
cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
yes let me tell you once again
i will send it back to you
ooh i can tell you darling that it is sexual healing
there is nothing to learn from that vacant voice
and they will ride you down to hell
for who are we to question her
drink to me! this heavenly body
the heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
i get along anyway i care
and a truth for a truth
he said to me you must not ask for so much
now my feet wo not touch the ground
now my heart is like a blister
let the saints attend to their keeping of the cathedrals
use a flag as a bandage
i am alright yes i am alright
do not fight for the wrong side
there is no telling how the day might end
lands in a heap on the street
somewhere i find something that is kind in you
i ca not get down and i wo not get down
when i look at my china girl
do not gimme no lip i have had my fill of it
i will put roses around your door
and it is not easy for me
on the screen there is a death
okay you win enough is enough
dance me to the wedding now dance me on and on
there we were on the sunset strip
cause what i felt before is gone
you realize he is only advertising one more shelter
stay my case of which i am certain
and fools do not run away
it is only rain that i feel
jazz police are talking to my niece
me i am robin hood and i puff on my cigarette
told them that i love you they all know it is true
i love you despite your convictions
you must not do it anymore
tear me tear me tear me
with your answer to something new
between the traitor and her pain
i am coming up the ladder
i guess that is just a chance
gonna see my friend make it go away
i caught the darkness it was drinking from your cup
when i am checking you out one day to see if i am
and then they have to die trapped within
and every thing she is laughing at
i believe we are not alone
oozing without me filling over with secrets
you did not count on that
some things they turn out right
seen the home inside your head
but i have run of points of view
in a struggle to be happy and free
and i wish that i was made of stone
oh oh oh i will be
so the maples formed a union
how many times have you heard?
like i am dancing on angels
there must be some way outta here but i ca not find it yet
or my head starts to ring
to reflect in puddles in the dirt
the ones who have done you wrong
i loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm
call it magic cut me into two
i guess we lived in the meantime
of holding each and every life
i am just a station on your way
and i am breathless over you
jo the waiter drops the tray
to keep you warm and dry
you have stared at the sun
he basted you with butter babe
and whisper the words that you need
does not smile for the child at play
what a field-day for the heat
he is got a date with fate in a black sedan
so come on every guy grab a girl
do you really need his heart for your throne?
my feet are heavy and i am rooted in my wellios
excitement so thick you could cut it with a knife
i stood there with my ear against the wall
and i do not want to think what i have done
you ca not melt it down in the rain
do you know what i really need?
i ca not avoid the lightning
he could only know how you have sinned
i will sit like a bird on a fence
empty and dead like the life you are losing
i got to be with you babe
with a drink and a friend
we can wear the rose of romance
if he is truly out of sight
four days and not much longer
took a trip in a gemini spacecraft
the captain is wife she says to him
just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future
oh and i am just waiting 'till the shine wears off
now so long marianne it is time that we began
they say i am unforgiven and i have to pay
is there anybody here who feels this low?
you will be his queen for the night
cocktails in the blue red and grey
this girl is maid of bond street
and you who had the honor of her evening
and cause you light up the path
but there were chains so i hastened to the hay
things between us must be worse but it is hard to see just how
to watch the water going by
i have seen that road before
when you want her only tell me where is she where?
about the real things to say
that the heart has got to open
i never want to say goodnight miracle goodnight
i want to dip your wings in blood
my father and all his tobacco loved you
the last i heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun
where they do not care how you are
save all your tears for tomorrow
i am not sure if i want to be up here at all
i know what you are doing
it all seems so long ago
well time i called my baby
i know it will crush you my memory would linger
must not grumble at silver and gold
say hi to earl and edith
dreaming of when the morning comes
i ca not run no more
i said left out in the cold
when you need someone to blame
it is the time of your lives its the time of your lives
but i knew that would not last
but then maybe we could again
a long pain ending without a song to prove it
that all my priests have passed?
i am afraid it is time for everyone to pray
and we can force you to be free
with no lover to free her desire
you have delusions and some spaced-out fantasies
some day i am gonna make big money
and their faiths are falling down down down down
and i know what i must do
it is just a stage --
and a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
we will be living from sin then we can really begin
'bout five miles 'cross the pond
just a kid and just at school
dom do do do dom do do do
and mad john finns' wife is all
and i will see if my friends are still there
it is all about my girl
who the hell do they think they are
but i could not make it stick
i am gunna give the gates a shove
the hyacinth wild on my shoulder
slowly slowly we lose the care that holds us
but you do not want to believe in a premonition
no-one ever plays the game game game
with the feeling that you would been away?
i am the weakness that feeds
kaleidoscopes that fall into the sun
the lookout has parked the car
it is longer than all the others combined
no more keeping my feet on the ground
and before that i would work i would rather sport and play
martin luther king day june th june th wednesday
behind us you will only see our dust
if culture is the curse of the thinking class
a little boy lost in a breaking storm
i will tie a knot in rainbow is end organise the breeze
and they have put me on these
they should be put in the chair
mom and poppa wo not let her go
with love in the land of the living
i have left a lover in many towns
standing with your head held high
oh and i am coming to cover the muck up
when i get home i am gunna waash these dirty rags
those were the days of power?
let god slip? out of heaven back to hell
i ca not read shit i ca not read shit
it is been such a long time
what are you trying to do?
they are mopping up the butcher is floor
i got daggers in my eyes
the cops are hanging around the house
in the swirling of this storm
he never knew what hit him
and it ai not gonna rain anymore
i told you i told you told you i was one of those
i wish i was a sailor a thousand miles from here
and blow it all to hell
sun comes up and the man goes down
stuck on the end of this ball and chain
i get this pad just like a cave
nobody can see you now but i can see you
i was not seized by jealousy at all
sell a slim body to the man next door
that i made and i could not keep
an old schedule of trains he will say
there is too much at stake to be down
you wo not be alone we have all got beery grins
he will drive his sports car until it is too late
through the silver and the glass
you will never find a sign peeling off the bar-room wall
it is no way of knowing
look at them look at us
the small gets big it is a rig
all words that look prounouncable are not typos any that look unpronouncable
you are told which side you are on
until the moom becomes the skinning tool
would my fears now be winning?
or write a song nobody has sung
hers is the face i see when a certain mood moves in
and a girl hitchhiking with her dog
now all your songs of beauty fail
they are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever
it is all that is left of leatherman
a secret face - a touch of grace
and the slaves are all working
i am a longway from home and i miss my loved one so
oh feelin' maybe he will see a little better set of days
i ai not never been in dutch
would i tear out both my eyes
and told me i comforted him uh-huh
you could speak well of me
seem like such a simple thing
they build up my body break me emotionally
i am talking far too much about my shame
and every kind of freedom done then oh
goddesses of mystery so delicate and so grand
i wish i was a bluebird i would never fly away
such a rush to get nowhere at all
bring your love back to me
i ca not take it any other way
without you it is a waste of time
then my father built an altar
the day laughs in your face
i held you til you learned to walk on air
they jumped up and nailed it to my shadow
not gonna leave it until its much too late
could you see the guy who was driving?
a soldier of love that is hard to beat
time to take stock and make omissions
i wo not fly down i ca not fly down
i got to bring you in
well my money is gone and so are you
i do not want to hear from those who know
you keepers of truth you guardians of beauty
to pick me up when i am on the ground
where live the lame and the blind
and it does not mean a thing
to bind your time it drives you to crime
there is one thing i am certain of
you asked for the latest party
tout ca avant qu'il soit trop tard!
i i i gave you something to die for
the air is thick and still
mister frog went a-courting and he did ride
where do we go to now?
and i put myself into your hands
he likes the look of that cadillac
the writer stares with glassy eyes
if you choose not to decide
all good things come to an end
quietly turning the back door key
bang bang and you are next in line
too long i roam in the night
you can see they have finally taken cover
see the braves in cool moonlight
and the bits flew far and wide
i was hopin' that we would turn bad
that is where i found you long time ago
you took me back to your place
now my feet wo not touch the ground
now the courtroom is quiet but who will confess
oh and time is a loaded gun
then they turned at last to me
i passed through the shadow of jupiter
i have been told that it could have been blue cheese
if you still remember that cold september
and i move and i wake up smiling
let my love open the door
staring back at me from the window beside
reign o'er me oh rain on me
you know she hides her face behind a veil
it ai not easy to get to heaven when you are going down
did you ever you wish that i was still there?
i will kill you if i must
sonic reducer sonic reducer sonic reduceroh
new things and old both disappear
and i will show you how it works
like a knight from some old fashioned book
why trade this vision for desire
to pull over in the storm
we each pay a fabulous price
and i know that you do too
it is the red shoes they ca not stop dancing
back to back to back back to back back brother
i love the beauty of rare innocence
and i ai not gonna no more
no matter i just ca not get it right
when your death takes its toll
and turning to the dwarves on the enclosured gate
if you wanna know what is shakin' down the house
tips his hat to a man
i would never trade tomorrow for today
every day and night i pray let the pendulum swing
you are running away from humanity
i love to see you sitting there upon your throne
did you forget this fucking singer so soon?
why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
and the wheels are turning turning
into life i have just been spoken
and the feel underneath the foam bush
and if i lost the map
great tears leapin' from her eyes
go on leave with the morning light
the man in white -- that is you -- says he has no friends
and all the senses rise against this
i do not believe in miracles
with your dark and roving eyes
i have gotta say i am on my way down
well old man river just keeps on rollin'
lean not upon your own understanding
i love it when you come over to my house
are stacked in the woodshed for further good use
your lips close to my lips
and the phases of the moon
do not grieve at the passing of mortality
do you need his labour for your baby?
the poor they spoil it for the rich
going to lock myself in a cold black room
there is nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
we do not need to listen to strangers
we are from the factory and we have come to play
outside in the cold distance a wildcat did growl
i was never any good at coming
why there is nothin' goin' down here
say what we are gonna let in!
driving my car flame trees on fire
let me hold your hand and be your loving man all night alright!
and i swear it happened just like this:
if they like the way they are made
since the end of world war ii
you ca not hear what i am saying
do not touch and do not touch
and nothing you would take aw huh
wo not need no shoe shine
i say where is the boy?
and you know it is for real
and i feel like i am falling apart
can you feel a little love?
i kissed you once i kissed you again
but ya traded in the mighty ol' man river
its you that i am living through
said one two three four five against one
evening comes to early for a stroll
i love you in the morning sun i love you in my dreams
connecting their minds with others through telepathy
i will be on your side baby
there will be an answer let it be
that her joy would seem like pain
even when you bend to give me
in a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster
trajectory are all one line on the block
sometimes i wake up when i am falling asleep
you could say i am nothing new
they took the game right out of it
and i keep on hammering keep on hammering keep on hammering
and it is here the lonely say
one that will sip sip sip
there they got the right to make an honest buck
and do those feet in modern times
dance with me - do not dance with me no
what kind of language is this?
but it is good to be free
you stepped out of a stranger
you know we have to make a case for love
it is already been sung but it ca not be said enough
through the dark streets they go searching to see god in their own way
with a ten dollar guitar strapped to his back
and that was the hardest part
the mechanics on the phone again we break down
but nothing is too broken to find a way back
father father everybody thinks we are wrong
of lighted streets on quiet nights
dream on 'till you can dream no more
all this time we are hoping and praying we all might learn
i have been listening to the new 'dj'
and i would love to hold you know
try my patience my patience tried
that that old nag was laid
you wo not stay satisfied for long
how have they worked for you?
shadows hide the play of light
i saved you the best seat in the house
i just want to send my love
are you lonely are you lost?
those who said a new world new ways ever free
yeah the type of girl responsible for original sin
my left hides under the chairs
and you are just in reach
i point my finger of hate
when you are too in love to let it go
i have gotta tell you what a state i am in
i am not tryin' to cause a b-b-big sensationtalkin' 'bout my generation
so long woman i am gone
and now i am telling you again
one eye on what you do
well i play by their rules
and it was the dwarves that were given the task of digging the ditch
start up the smile i suppose
come a ky ky yippee yi ay
i am wishing you a wellmind at peace within yourself
she said just take off my red shoes
lay back and let your feeling show
just to watch the smile fade away
i knocked the door at lukin isopened the fridge
to think that i did not forget that child
all the love you could have given
you are making coffee for everyone concerned
oh there were times she was just a child
ca not be happy in their shade?
who have opened up to me
and i am coming back to find you
rush - it is the cars the clothes the dough
memory strumming at the heart of a moving picture
just a few simple words like i love you i need you
september she knows i can feel
i am happy when life is good
and i am sure you will
there was an i will wind blowing
at the alpha and the omega
i am on the road tonight
ooh baby for the sake of love
but now it must be wine
undermine chairman i went too far
chickens i told you you brand new
a little green worm inside my head tonight
that is when i will be there always
she sees so ready that i get enough
a hundred miles a hundred miles a hundred miles a hundred miles
where did all the money go
and every door i ever tried was locked
a garden to nurture and protect
so you take a picture of something you see
you have made a bad connection 'cause i just want your sex
drive my girl in the park
then i grew up to be a fireman
i ca not belong i was wrong
they say that my obsession is unholy
come on shout and dance give him praise
wondering why no one else is around
and see it working for them
from ibiza to the norfolk broads
i do not want to follow death and all of his friends
but he is a lot more afraid of your lying
i hear them whispering maybe it is better that way
and those winds sure can blow cold 'way out there
but he is not asked and he do not know
you have been hiding riding me to a state
and did you forget my song?
i put on my cloudiest suit
and i am not gonna stand and wait
the sky is still dark nearing dawn
and all your dreams have vanished
did you know that i do not care
all i know that sometimes the truth is contrary because sometimes the target
is to sail forever upon the stain
love can turn to a long cold burn
oh real bright light shining as you are trying to breathe in thin air
or a king on the run
back where there is nowhere to stay
rush - okay yo i ama make sense of it tell 'em
and without a sound i turn around
i have tried too long you know
it was right behind your eyes
we have never seen anything like it
you hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
late breaking story that i do not understand
some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap
she knows how to jump and shout
all the memories going round round round round
where you just play a tune
i feel so good i feel like banging my box
for the sea offers nuthin to hold or touch
i will love her till the day that i died
i would jump in the river and drown
show me do not tell me
when you search in vain to find
and i will pick up all my things
got one eye on the road and one on
amen to anything that brings a quick return
in my lonely room i would sit my mind in an ice cream cone
and i wished for so long cannot stay
cause i know it ai not me and hope it is not you
assassination of the voice of god
it is a mistake in the making
i have heard their stories heard them all
words and music by kaye - weisman - fuller
i just know that i am harder to console
and i feel my heart beating
yeah she is too much yeah yeah
he does not ask for your company
i do not remember the feelings
saying lord lead me not into temptation
we are choosing the path between the stars
i found a fox caught by dogs
i would make a deal with god
he got her drunk very quickly
you do not care what you lose
and i forged myself a golden statuette
these things are not good for me
losing her again is more than i can bear
a war between the man and the woman
well he look in the mirror and say
but the beautiful-est treasures lie in the deepest blue
call them the diamond dogs call them call them ooo
wanna feel the groove then clap your hands
if you never try you will never know
look out for everywhere under the sun
i was running he was walking
o god what have i done he said
and i have seen time run out
many times i have often prayed
do you remember a guy that is been
i ca not raise my glass without seeing her ass
our secret is safe and still well kept
that i am not the one who loves
do you have a punishment under the white lace
not so long since you complained
to be found within a song
i got a bed in the house
i am just a fool in love with you
let the words that you say to me
and do not you know that
they found what they will always want again
move from my window leave me alone
and in an instant the laughter is gone
sickened by sun with rainstorms lashing him rotten
give me peace of mind at last
there is a fork in the road ahead
he is mumbling words you ca not understand
she will show you where to shoot your gun
if you are running in a circle how can you be too careful?
my death it almost bored me
we will be glowing in the dark
something so you feel all grown up when you call my name
i want to hear you beg for 'him'
for trying to change the system from within
took six big wheels and rolled our bodies
i know progress has no patience
they are so war-torn and resigned
when he just ca not go on
and i think my blood is boiling
and so i pray every night
that left a big mark on me
oh what a nice contented world
changing the gray and changing the blue
and my brother is back at home
it is easier here just to forget fear
i got a heart full of soul!
sonny is burning pits into me
it is a wonder tall trees ai not layin' down
we are in the zombie room
up above girls walk past the roses all in bloom
all the colors in the sky
so get up get up and scream oh!
crucifix hangs and my heart is in my mouth but it is here
there s a law there is an arm there is a hand
i am looking for a future
i do not sleep without you
and softly whispered  isome day soon'
like a gun that you will not learn to aim
wo not let the darkness swallow me
and now i do not know where
i will got him on the wedding list!
you will see it is not a reprise
this ai not rock'n'roll this is genocide!
again you would see it you know right round the lips
they want to shake my hand
it wo not be long until you will do
but i was lonely i was lost
said the man with the shovel shoveling the ashes
driven up and down in circles
chopped it open with an axe
that i was bleeding in my nose
just one more who is searching for
let him put his arms around me
try as hard as you can i have tried as hard as i could
i can see you drifting away
cause i am your kind of guy
who is longing for some rest
you do not know what is goin' on
come on do not give up do not say we give in
i will see you on the other side
o-o you know that i must die
wants to be bad so i let her be bad
when you hear your spirit talk?
it is something in between i guess
and what can i tell you my brother my killer
but the room just filled up with mosquitoes they heard that my body was free
upon the shore beneath the bridge
i have saved all my ribbons for thee
oh the first time that you tried a pill
it is hard to make that change
song of love to sing for you
it is a parallax you dig?
yeah they want to feed the world
tear me up if you like
cause there is one thing that she do not need
i looked for you in everyone
now there is nothing more to say
you said hey nature boy are you looking at me
i guess i need that city life
if thine is the glory mine must be the shame
and suddenly i find myself listening
oh bop fashion it is loud and tasteless and i have heard it before
she burned the mess they clean? instead
i can see her walking to me even now
to lose those old spud blues
tho' it is not what i planned
sonny is burning holes into me
the whims that we are weeping for
i do not wanna talk about jed
drilling for fear makes the job simple
and tamed it in the rapture
turnin' down a road leads i know not where
just like his wife before she freezed on him
i never tried to hide them
you show me tell me you are not teasin'
for the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
i left my house without my coat
but he would be climbing on that bus
available on the rare on air benefit cd
i do not know where you have flown
come and buy my little toys
you promise every treasure to the foolish and the wise
will i walk the long road?
so i am thinking bit too fast like a brain hatch
with all the things i do not know
so faraway and yet so close
move it up move it up
and i do not feel the pressure
she will flow down your river
i do not know which way i am going
i know that i am forgiven
but no-one knows about your low-life
and maybe i had miles to drive
every beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all hang-ten outta santa fe
and i would like to be i would like to be i would like to be back on the ground
they have been picking up little pieces
as though photographed on the impact of a stomach punch
oh you use your heart as a weapon
know it is a feeling and it comes from above
i thought we had something precious
i have got you like a habit
you learn to ride the earth
never let me go tie me to the mast
and find a rope hanging there
but nothing is ever quite like
a poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
long to give up the same old way
wears a wedding band that is good
i am goin' back to the usa
i would sure like to see her when the sun goes down
when there is nothing to be gained
there is just one thing we can do about this
the sky is ready to burst
meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
fly up to the surface and just start again
the smell of the front line is survival
i throwed my things in the little boat
feel my eyes and the tongue of a killer
she is away and westward bound far above the cloud she will fly
it did not take long before
you have to give me everything
do you fall like dust on a ruin?
there are many in your life
for i might just stop loving you loving you loving you
to lick us with the first-born lash of dawn
i am the shadow man the jumping jack
i do not believe in a god
the birds they sang all a choir
all the great theorists and teachers eaten alive
the boys from your gang are knocking whisky back
we keep spinning round and round
if all the good times are all gone
well you were made to play games with your soul instead
as the sun and the drama start to mount
the waves are rising and rising
oh and twisted thoughts that spin
you will have to be gone before my man billy dilly comes
just like his wife when she was beautiful
nail-biting hood boys in borrowed ties and jackets
as the people here grow colder
let me introduce you to the gang
your name was the one that was always chosen
he knows changes are not permanent
this time you are flying on
now i hear the world talking
around the neck of our consumptive rose
when you have a question answers will come
she loves to come for her ride
so take her for a ride
and is this what you wanted
i make my rye whiskey but i wo not tell you how
they say there is strangeness too dangerous
and the wheels just keep on turning
hey baby there ai not no easy way out
let me go boys let me go
every thing she wants is hers
sometimes words do not say the things you mean
just a whisper a whisper a whisper
life shuffles past at a low interest rate
the holy places where the races meet
i saw my baby trying hard as babe could try
feels more like surrender than defeat
for you to call out the dogs
because of you i need to rest oh yes
i keep forgetting that you told me that you
that is how it would be
i will just give it a try wo not let good times pass me by
all the blues and the reds get to me
and earl is glad you guys showed up
oh brother i left a woman in that morning bed
will kneel and let his kingdom rise
how much can you throw over the walls?
and i know where you are
memories lost in the faded films
the day wherever it takes me
do you ever get that feeling
someone to claim us someone to follow
i am tired of this marble floor
people could not believe what i would become
do not even know you but i need you to love me too
just the mention of your name
man is an obstacle sad as the clown oh by jingo
the odds are there to beat
where the water is glowing green
how can a view become so twisted
oh i am on my own
much too far i gone this time
he tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
he backed up and fled this town
i felt the gloom of empty rooms
pledge my grievance to the flag
come see come see remember me?
without you i am just miles away
if i do not lose control
he is a man he is a guru
how i want your soul to keep of and all around the bend
that is not the electric light my friend
they have followed you right back to your gate
see my baby feel like fucking you
this is my hope in an alleyway
why that is the one right up top a mine
and scatter them across the sky behind you
hang a shining star upon the highest bough
this is a song of color
she would grown up hungry she would grown up poor
must be out of their mind
i do not take too much stock
and i hear from the nurse that he is gotten much worse and his practice is all
there rose before me a little house
big money done a power of good
pipeline bonsai to the saddle bowl
how come you bother with my heart at all?
i am begging for more again
they wished the cloud boys sang to me
for me it is not over
i will tell you something that you do not know
i ca not find him - misty
just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
so far so good no one saw you
and the odd negotiation a rarity
snowed in at wheeler street just two old flames keeping the fire going
they say your life is going very well
i ca not believe what i am doing to you
i love the sound of making love the feeling of your skin
say it was in his shoe
all my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
if it looked the other way
she just hollers what she wants from where she is
well come on well come on if you think we are gonna make it
i would sit inside a bottle and pretend that i was in a jam
my ship cannot resist her long
i was the pimp is main prophet i kept everything cool
they are all as sane as me
i have got to know what is making my heart sing
all that we can do is be reminded
guess i will lie alone just like before
it is time to make amends
zero hero says i am no-one
and you know that you can trust her
so i am gonna buy a gun and start a war
fuck it i am just gonna go home turn on the fuckin' tv
ca not you hear me cry
as we cross the bridge - the burning bridge
emma is been run out on
until one day a trigger come cocking
and lighting that torch and watching it burn
the crooked heart swells around yeah
when i tell you you are blind
between the sundial and the chain
they wanted to interview grandpa on the porch
cotting out little lines in the ice
let me in unlock the door
on the edge of the collapse
so unforgiving yet needing forgiveness first
he is found the answer that we lost
he keeps coming forward but never moving
i love the whirling of the dervishes
you have not got a hold at all
like you knew i would do
and the key is in the lock
you will see your problems multiplied
and now i know why i am scared to die
and i missed you since the place got wrecked
that i could be so cold
i would like to pretend that my father was wrong
but i just ca not help it
i saw sunrise i saw sunlight
and i watched that man to a stranger
life ai not what it is worth a breath and a scr oh reach the door
i wish i believed in your heaven
when i first came to town
and in my best shoes i started falling
past the mills past the stacks
lying on my back in the school yard
stay for a while and they wo not see you again
the respect you have for me
he kissed me on the mouth
you are just too dark to care
yeah they have bargained their virtue
waits for aladdin sane - you will make it
with the dream in her eyes no one is seen
now i seem to know it well
beneath the creeping shadow of the tower
and the moan of the wind laughs and laughs and laughs
i could not move to warn all the younger soldiers
it is a question of not letting
he was known in the islands as hundred foot iron
but i am not to blame
she is everywhere! now that she is gone! gone! gone!
we feel no need to worry
i thought of my friends who had died of exposure
i will say i am searching for the truth
so tonight we gonna party like it is
we think you are really cool
she said i have been sick
i would not be stuck here in this hole
when you have fallen on the highway
in the mist of some sweet afternoon
when i am lord at last
when i am lookin' down on you
one day sadie wound and wound
but they have summoned they have summoned up
yeah i am still hanging out in your blue tunes
but there is nothing i can say
but he always dives too soon too fast to save himself
got fuel to burn got roads to drive
and he lives on top of manhattan chase
i can spill my drink from the woman at the sink
'what if i wo not see you again'
that cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
stay in bed why waste my time
so my body leaves no scar
and never know what is good for me
and fear walk hand in hand
cold wind blows on the soles of my feet
yes i follow my father is trade
arthur is a singer with a band
like a bigger blacker third bird
when i think about the people
they say that i am all over
we ca not work it out
and i know i like you
this special morning brings another sun
i will give it due reflection
he said woman look-a here woman
oh i once was lost and now i am found
why wo not you let me die at all?
but she wo not mind me lying
doing all right but you gotta get smart
i am floating up above the world now
i was counted with the dead
i laughed and climbed the rising cast
oh yes i would oh yeah
in the dark and brooding silence
my priests they will put flowers there
and i made myself a money-man
i will just wait around 'til springtime
i said i have done things
now i have seen to sonny is burning
'cause she knows how it wears me out
i am not there to call
been burned and with both feet on the ground
when i was a hitchhiker on the road
just in time at times i guess
was i supposed to praise my lord
what you believe is what you are
wo not you set me free
but time has passed me by
to the end of the last page
but i know i have shown
with legs like scissors and butcher is knives
is there anyone else here who does not know?
whispered in my ear the things i would like
once you go there was never never an honest word
you came to rain a flood
dream the farmer in the old heartland
weather is good there in the fall
so daily i renew my idle duty
you are my best friends in between
and start acting like a fool
i do not remember our secrets
i love the way she walks i love the way she talks
so the doctors stitch and stitch
find you never had to stop
i will travel there on my own
i want to die in your arms
i can tell you what fear is
neon lights are bright on broadway
this is detention it is not fun at all
i will take your lands and all that lays beneath
but you are no use to me lifesize
there will be fires on the road
but i could not stand to touch her now
the kids are gonna get it in an all right way
yeah the one with the champagne eyes
wouldo you know this man? '
and we both know that it is gonna be alright
or a span of geological time
packaged like a rebel or a hero
i hold myself like a god
god only god knows i am trying my best
but out there who would not
every time i think i have had enough
fun fun is the one thing that money ca not buy
i will keep you warm and
if you are going to mess
believe in what we are told
take its broken waist in your hand
but he wo not ring the bell
then leave me to my enemied dreams
no one wants to take my mind
i will dance my life away
just a whisper a whisper a whisper a whisper
i have got an unfortunate feelin' i have been beaten down
well do you see ca not you see what i am feeling?
he woke up god from a deep deep sleep
give me that window to the world
the air is charged a humid motionless mass
i saw the grim and stood above
sometimes it almost breaks my heart
here in the room with you now
his little heart it beats so fast
that what happens there beyond the glass
on a rainy night in soho
my love is only for me
it must be time to leave
the stars have lost their fire
and let her sail on the sea like a stone
yeah 'n' i am doin' all right in school
i have never hurt like this
headed for the heart of cygnus
like your so explicit clothes onto the floor
striking out like a bull from a balloon
from ripping off the stars from his face
i go out of my head
if you want to go riding
ah changes are taking the pace i am going through
there is a lot of people sayin' we would be better off dead
i did not eat i did not sleep
if you hate something do not you do it too it too
she gotta dance she gotta dance
i wish i could talk to you
keep on rockin' in the free world x
i was walking in the shadow of my death
her hair the gold that gold can be
nothing left to keep us down
you can dance the dream with your body on
maybe as a game you lost
i am going out of my mind
have you seen the flags of freedom?
that all we ever seemed to do is fight
see him gesture to his neighbors
now i am older than movies
send them home on the morning train
yes i understand that every life must end aw huh
when that angel stuck in my mind
i have got to fight the need
i get my machine to let them in
dream the logger in the great northwest
but i do not know why
and throw them in the lake!
a race around the stars a journey through
be the ocean when it meets the sky
but it is either that or pay off the kidnapper
glory is death in his name
do not pray for my soul
and stay all night with me
wish that your arms were around me
and i am not asking you for nostalgia
there are too many people too much belief
guess you will buy a gun
oh man! look at those cavemen go
by hands that looked so smooth to me
and then some day you would leave me for somebody new
the food is hot and the table is ready
and he yells to the cook
all that we have fought for
i saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
it is hard to lay blame
this addiction that we are both part of
when you see the flags of freedom flyin'
i will give life to disease
'cept the look yeah the look
keep ready for you and she is ready for me
he sees no reason for the fighting
if god has a master plan
now that is what i call romance
like you would do for one you love
to my surprise and my delight
i am gonna put it six feet underground
they have hosed you down you are good as new
that wo not accept the white one
so rest in peace my nightingale
i should have trusted from the start
oh i wish that i could
'cause nobody will no you are there
i suppose the things i overheard were quite by chance
phone calls i take my machine
through the tears in my ey-y-yes
the things that we are concealing
i will love you till i die
this is something that just ca not be understood
so the image breaks down again
and the water came running down
all i know is you are not with me
she breaks down and cries to her husband
it is the time of your lives it is the time of your lives
like a worm on a hook
now that jack is black shadow is gone
i still could not close my eyes
to the city just in time
hang on a minute just a minute please
if it can guide me to you
dissolves like a star falling down
there is a sailor who dies
then you can come back and be with me
you are so lucky i am around
well that is how broken i would be
and i will cry girl but i will come a-running
i was not swinging from the hell
light your pillow lay back watch the flames
he is straight and he is true
you do not have to run and hide away
cruise me cruise me cruise me babe
but you may feel a little sick
and there will be no hesitatin'
take the time to close your
you wait a lifetime to be found
joe the lion made of iron repeat ad inf
swings through a hollow of haze
so if you do not come back again
through the quicksand and the clay
i am goin' down to georgia been up in tennessee
are not often what they seem
let is get this show on the road
oh i will dine on honey dew
or how i lost my way
but a rumour that is probably true
and this nation is about to explode
but down in his heart now
i feel like meat on the street
you talk too much you laugh too loud
the miller told your father that he would work it with the greatest will
leave all your sorrows behind you
but as i walked through the foggy streets alone
your silent mouth mouths 'yes' dear
il adressa ces mots: he addressed these words:
know your place in life is where you want to be
between the hour and the age
you see we would never met
some see life as an endless fight
let me be that muscle down the street
the stories and songs nothing is ever
play the fool act so cruel i loved it!
the hands in the stable are willing and able to pay
so should i learn how to lie?
he went racing down the halls
lost in the waves of a sickness
put on your red shoes and dance the blues
i would talk to you of all matter of things
i was riding in a truck
fly to me through this love-lit night
a man like me do not like to see
are you livin' like you talk?
the promise of a decent job
now it is tomorrow and everything has changed
as he picked up the phone
and let my body catch up
i am back on boogie street
when i get home i am gunna quit them drugs
i know you can make it good
i belong in the past and i am yours
do not let the dark into me
look up and you see birds
and i believe in some kind of path
we are at lots of fun fun fun
fame nien! it is mine! is just his line
torn by what we have done and ca not undo
and it is all there to see
you pickin' someone else is patch
and now i know about your special kisses
i am sick and tired of hearing things
i will come on to the leader
wearing a mask in white colour
whistling tunes we hid in the dunes by the seaside
dream a voice in the wilderness
if the innocent are saved then what happens to her
so i wrote to the gov'nor the whole damned bunch
do not leave me here alone
where the dark lord cannot go
that bad motherfucker called stagger lee
and the secret places of the heart
can i sail thru the changing ocean tides
yes so we are flowers all a woman is body yes
we ca not go on thinking
i fell for so long for you all
jazz police have got their final orders
well i try i do i really try
for the millions in a prison
i pity the fool that falls in love with you
we will meet by the tubeway as the screamer cries eleven
i cannot raise my glass without seeing her ass
for your love is better than any love other i have know
see they came for you they came snapping at your heels they came snapping at
all i knew to give you
when it all comes down so bad
i hope it does as i have planned
the well went down so very deep
and just like a lover i watched her fly away
test tube genes and slot machines
will now mean you and here
and rain that ever-loving stuff down on me
and i want you to know
suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
hoping that it wo not be you
is the faith that you still got
i would like to stay and see the whole thing go down
and they called her sweet alice d'head
swimming in the deep blue sea
all i want is a song of love
clearly you do not have to be on your own
but i will rip up the trees
how can i leave you in such a house?
now there is another man workin' in my place
why would you let me go?
idle tidal rush in tried all with a limb is all legs and armour
so i could hear you singing
news had just come over we had five years left to cry in
i made every effort not to abuse her
and leapin' under my wheels as i careered outta longwood on my way to you
so be careful who it is you are talking to
it is out of my hands making all hands meet
but night makes a fool of us in daylight
do not look at me you fuckhead
who had fainted to the whirling
and the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind
sometimes i hear you call my name in the dead of the night
open your eyes but only if you can
before i let you take me home
you are god and you got big hands
i watch the sea it helps to anchor me
and i ca not look down
and a bellhop hops and bops
dry your eyes and do not weep
and the poor man does without
until the ends have met through
all the things that you wanted for me
i am you and you are me
oh is this your long lost son and he is never had dear old dad
'screw up your brother or he will get you in the end'
for a little bit of home
every day and night i pray
you have got to let him go
my typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
we have split the wood and stoked the fires
and the johnny walker wisdom running high
do not let the sun go down
and you feel him cut you down
spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
i am just the slave of a burning ray
i might just stop needing you
are you running in a circle?
i just want someone to be there for
that is how broken i would be
i really hate to leave you now
i found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood
but the cold light of day
and the truth could not appear
i do not need a voix in the dark
but i just want to forget
take it in take it in right
i cannot blame it all on her
unless it is done by a policeman
back pages and days alone the could have been spent
when you lose something you cannot replace
i got this rig that runs on memories
when the water takes me home
do i need permission to stop?
the sword sinks in lightning strikes
go get her go get her
you set me free i set you free
the king is gone but he is not forgotten
and the way that gravity turns on everyone
muddy water taking back the land
everything that you care for yeah yeah
i am a seer but i am a liar
dreams that roam between truth and untruth
mindless drifter on the roadwhy do i
flying too close to the sun
i see it break on your horizon
this gene pool do not hurt me
she was no longer with me
to go into the garden go under the ivy
and the gods watched from afar
you would be crying out in pain
out of town where the people i knew
i am giving you control now
go back home under the posies
still life on a shelf when
i have a bunch of purple flowers
that you might think would disappear resolving
and you want to travel with him
when she bends to my longing
young enough not to care too much
it is too big a word
no hand of friendship for the likes of me
everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
here is the kitchen - there is your basket
well all the people have got their problems
'cause you got no more than bitter
you it is you and me
your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
fly on ride through maybe one day i can fly with you
and the carny is van still sat upon the edge
the ponies run the girls are young
hit the lick quick get the bricks quick
i would rather be with an animal
she can remember a time denied
with a voice loud and clear
i see the gods in battle rage on high
do not take what is not theirs they do not compare
brother then i will be your sister
start as you mean to go on
you seem to like it here
i know life would be different if i held on held on
but who are they to judge us
is the root of all his sorrows
there is no home there is no bread
take this waltz take this waltz
please say that if you had not have gone now
we raise our hats to the strange phenomena
i am not sure what i am looking for anymore
to sit within a fragrant breeze
and said oh when will you ever learn?
ya stay for a while then you pick up and go
that is where i learned most of what i know
as her escort asked her softly
you do not need opinions and rumours
i want you at the front
then it is the blue ones who ca not accept
they were there to wave to you
the fox chases the rabbit round
are drifting through my opened mind
i even heard the angels declare it from above
looks like that is the one
and the bridge of death was crossed
they say you never care for me
frankie lane he was singing jezebel
and if you should ever think of me
i will make your vision sing
and i can cry like you cry
all i can do now is wait for the noise
and then i will find a friend
hanging down in bunches from my roof
do not say you love me
could be the turn of a key
i was held from the rooftop then they let go
oh i am so worried about my love
as i have bathed my own
put them on and your dream will come true
they shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries
i ca not take any more
you can really learn a lot that way
the gap between actor and act
they are leaving here leavin' here
sometimes the special guest he do not like to leave
want to watch that bullet lay 'em down
too many things on my mind
head at your feet fool to your crown
i do not like young girls
and those who dance begin to dance
oh half his life a hand-me-down wasted away
did i see you down in a young girl is town
sent sparks zapping out your face
i have seen the nations rise and fall
it says turn around you fool you know you love him more and more
taste the whip and bleed for me
for the sea will swallow up the mountains
i sit here in the thunder
i think i want to change my attitude
on the streets he is walkin' wounded
we claimed the very source of joy ran through
i could walk like brando right into the sun
hail hail the lucky ones i refer to those in love yeah
down through the wreckage and the ruins
one night we are bathed in light
oh give me the night i ca not take another sight
for all will pass with time
but he would rather be home
well now she is taking you to bed
oh now i think i must be miles up
you are not gonna put those scabs on me
it is about to be writ again
i was born in a cloud
so whatever you do do not let go
you know this dress rehearsal rag
and i want to feel like that
another mile of silence while i am
as a warning as a warning
down fall by the wayside no getting out
why ca not you just tell me
with daddy is typewriter for a couple of months
and i will be two steps on the water
i have got friday on my mind
to break my fast on honey dew
thought i would get you off my mind
your vision is right my vision is wrong
the wind sir it was wicked
i will always be a dreamin' man
soon be overand i will relent
and it bangs about the new-made leaves
ooh i pull out pull out the pin
sexual healing makes me feel so fine
oh god i need a drink
the shadows moved across me inch by inch
i tear my soul to cease the pain
brought tales of old to light
in the madness that calls 'now'
come on yeah oh oh yeah sing out yeah
it is just my job five days a week
why should i whisper in the church?
so you can hurt hurt me bad
so if the skies turn dark
and took me dream by dream
ooh you just want to get it right sometimes
traffic cops are all color blind
well i feel like they are talking in a language i do not speak
you do not know what you have angered
i guess the reason i am so scared of it
tho' the rain and the sun come through
jesus taken serious by the many
with half a mind to run away
the world swings through a passing fable
i have been gone so long
what will you think i have said
then you jump back down to the rooftops
while half the world is wasting the day
i saw him in nassau in
but still i will raise the flag
be-side to december will be magic again single
the air is shattered by the awesome sound
a push me and i will resist this behavior is not unique
gone are the days of rainbows
on the cloud that you are sitting
to our love send a coffin of wood
your face has fallen sad now
to mom and dad this just does not matter
ai are e m un buon cetriolo
when i learned the golden rule
she would attract a great big crowd
except to say it is not worth a dime
though your confidence may be shattered
for all our grand plans babe
with blue-black bracelets on my wrists and my ankles
'cos it is gonna be me it is gonna be me
if you have been hiding from love
poor you oh what you gonna do
i been buried in the snow
why do you stand by the window
and the bulb that burned above him
it is tomorrow they send me
yeah how long must you wait for it?
those blackbirds they have all flown and
i am trying hard to begin
from the middle east to the middle west
when there is nothing there to tie me down
take my hand not my picture spilled my tincture
the worst thing about it all
you can cry by my window
love love can break her fall
this town fulla men with big mouths and no guts
i will feel alive as long as i am free
i am very sorry baby does not look like me at all
when i tell you i love you
but it sounds like bubble gum
i got a rocket ship that i wanna ride
she will turn once more to sunday is clown
o mr smith and mr wesson
so the pentagon sent a cable
being bored and your prophet straight and tall
double dealin' rockin' rollin' and a reelin'
i ai not had much loving yet
everybody is out there trying to get money
ooh we just want to get it right sometimes
hi he is doing the shy retuine right now
it is terribly vague what is gone before
oh and i am coming to sparkle the dark up
there is always tellers in the big room
it is almost light that is right that is it
what am i trying to do
a wave toward the clearing sky
when i am dead and hit the ground
yeah i oh i am still alive
i was standing outside your door
youll take it all and run from me
did you ever cry yourself to sleep?
you ca not hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
it used to be so civilised
and if it all comes down to
but now it is rusted from the elbows to the finger
we are fulfilling our only destiny
you are crying buckets she gives her glove a wave
i hear stories from the chamber
last night you were on my balcony
where two halves make two wholes
so much talk it makes no sense at all
you have climbed the hills with me to the mountain shelter
sold us all to the hunger
quiet in conscience calm in their right
you were the promise at dawn
when i kneel in your arms
on the banks of red roses my love and i sat down
i hear it breathe i hear it sigh
oh and the waves are going out
just put the words together for me
your body is heck a slammin'
in your tears and in your blood
and the moon has lost her voice
the saddest words you could ever say
you wo not try to start again
turn your magic on to me she would say
i do not think he died for me
your eyes are hanging out your head
are not good for my health
but not for the first time
and no one wondered or had to go
i do not know how to stop
for the one that makes me weep
can you feel it? can you?
god gave you style and gave you grace
do you fall like a fading desire?
i let my skin get too thin
i will never suck satan is dick
let is hit the road from city to city everyone is on the move
everyone the whole work holds it is breath again
blame it on your karmic curse
then it is the new man
and i guess he just never got warm but you stand there so nice in your
yes and i sin every single day
i will howl like a wolf
i will settle for nothing less
then you climb you climb into the frame
i would call it my death
even after all the blue-haired ladies
but we all know there is a law
i ai not had those arms around me
i will leave it under the stairs
go to the country take the dog
i did not think the moon would mind at all
everybody knows the good guys lost
and it was this genius hand that pushed me up the hotel stairs
to tell me it is alright
he is lying dead clutching benjamins never put the money down
she saw her clothes were changing
i know what i have to do
and old eyes do not cry for me
you just wanna get it right sometimes
i wish i had that drive
burning in the moment - trapped by the desperation
you should not mess with me
break the innocent when they are proud
and now on sundays i elude the eyes
no one sees it 'cause the sand
sometimes i cringe sometimes i live
is i stayed there once and i almost fit
this house is full of m-m-madness
just find someone who is turning
leave us helpless helpless helpless helpless
we keep you alive for now
seems i have seen you before
seed to seedling root to stem
all of this and her dark hair oh lord
where the troops that lay conquered
i see the men of learning
the very minute that i leave
oh-oh-oh even if your aims are shadows
all the stories will come out
minding yours what is mine not yours
you can add up the parts
to find the song of the oil and brush
and i wrapped him in a hello magazine
i just want to tell you
and wondered why i had to pay
are not as close as they appear
it is been a long long time
all winter we got carried away
and neither race nor creed remain
was a fearful flurry and row
how does he do it? how do they do it? uncanny and immutable
it is not the company i keep
the fire will eat the streets of old soho
the vows that break the world are spoke
she is in the pocket of a home boy
i would have to live alone
but i do not want to think i want to feel!
i have changed my face i have changed my name
i must make her i must take her
i feel you waiting for me
they are all i have got
to treat the gelignite tenderly for me
but she wo not stake her life on you
is shows like 'leave it to beaver'
and since she spoke the truth to me
or dangle devils in a bottle
talkin' bout a friend of mine
and i have got nothing left to lose
picking all of the berries that grew there
stare in the darkness and the defeat
oh yeah your skin and bones
you wo not really be alone
i reached the wrong ends by the wrong means
if i am not free now
bee girl you are gonna die
i sing with impertinence shading impermanent chords
keeping my soul and my senses apart
yeah lay down your arms and love me peacefully yeah
walk with me now under the stars
i got a problem i got a problem
angels she takes her life from realms of light
to play the scene of bringing
she is losing that inner flame
on the south side of the town
you better pray your daddy is come to take you away
turns out he is the one making waves waves waves
those people do not have any respect
i would burn you if you should die
baby do not you let go
i am glad you have come along
she tried to turn her radio down
for a vision that still grows
we will dance on the sun
i had to practice it while everybody slept
one look and you will always regret
that tricked the mass for private gain
but i know that this will never be mine
and glued it top to bottom
hollowed out to fit their rifles
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere
he was a partner of mine
as long as i am a ghost you can see
johnny plays the sitar he is an existentialist
bells are hanging  x  the holly and the nativity
i went to bed last night and my
along the loom of the land
if the sea were sand alone
from the east to the west she goes down every day
i am your disconnected number now
i am coming now i am coming to reward them
driven out --- on the thin end of the wedge
play your cards show us what you got
stink of cologne and baccy and all their yankee hash
that night that you planned to go clear
i can take the afternoon the night time comes around too soon
whenever i look out french windows
i am seeing a tunnel at the end of the lights
'twas long ago i found you
my burning desire started on sunday
he said talk of love not hate things to do - it is getting late
and i wonder does she looks down as she flies on by?
onward! and upward! and i am off to find love
but watch the one fallin' in the street
put it out of your mind
you see the thoughts in my head
my lips are shakin' my nails are bit off been a month since i heard myself
with every door that we opened
i said i wont be breaking no rocks
very numb outside but warm within
to become the sythe to cut the corn
and please do not be ashamed
please baby lay down your arms
and got swallered up by a big black snake
why do we have to hate
on a bare wind blasted shore
and my heart is like ice
i have never known fear like this before
but it rolled me right along
take the only tree that is left
i never can say goodbye no no no no no oo
because i came here with a load
it was not my surface most defiled
green sleeves there is no one home
i never did anything out of the blue woh-o-oh
with his red still wet she said--
in the meadow dusk i park my aerostar
and i stacked all my accomplishments beside her
the sun machine is coming down
i know it makes no difference
that is how my love goes
to what i have to say
sometimes i just want it to slow down
i was looking for an end to this for some kind of closure
i got  more minutes to go
and leave no word of discomfort
waiting to keep the appointment she made
what do you mean that is it?
and someday i will die and look in our [?]
someone switched her on then her beam went wrong
you pray til the break of dawn
you try the handle of the road
what about you how can i count on you to count on me?
when you were an island to discover
i would not change a single thing
are you leaving dear? are you leaving dear?
a sea was storming inside of me
it is just history repeating itself
who will say i was one of god is sorrier creatures
if i were to say to you girl we could not get much higher
the sisters fell back and said do not that man look pretty
you can see my eyes and tell that i am not lying
i will look for you if i am ever back this way
those bonfire lights in the mirrored sky
to leave while she is gone
the locals rose up some of them were mad as hell
to prove you are with us too
her engine is running and the fuel is clean
get down get down love henry she cried
they got one eye watching you
has the trees in constant motion
we could will it to the sky
some of them burned on our ceilings
sorrow is child all weak and strange
grey riders flew across my lawn
in a garden full of roses
i crawled inside 'where else to go'?
and i think my head is melting
god put a smile upon my face
when you get what you need
the holy dove be caught again
and when i switch on the light
i care for no one else but you
it is coming from the women and the men
and kiss the cheek of the moon
it is all good yo it is all hood listen
sometimes i swear i hear it laugh at me
did i see you walking with the boys
yes i called my fingerprints all night
i wanted to get right with you
hail is beatin' down on our heads
i think it is time to change my face
pure as the driven snow before it got him
as he goes whistling past his daddy past his daddy is grave
joanni joanni joanni joanni blows a kiss to god
tuesday i locked up in jail
mean street i really do not know why
if time had not stood still
i ca not remember ever feeling this bad
and i said it was me
because the endings just to hard to take
speaking to me from the depths below
i hope he never lets me down again
now you hear your conscious call
oh did not we have fun?
watch me fly above the city
that is one more time around and there is not a sound
whistling tunes we are kissing baboons in the jungle
i will give it her the money later
i think i can see you
down below i always kept it to myself
forever a hostage of your child is world
well we think you would better wake up capt'n
all this noise i am waking up
i wo not be breaking no rocks
and i am just a whisper a whisper a whisper a whisper
there is a cry that is heard in the city
i want her pure as power i want her skin slightly musty with petticoats
like the willows in the wind
i tried leave my past behind
taht i steal like a robber
there was magic in the air
every gun you ever held went off
a world so out of touch
and i would do it all again if i had to today
leave them alone or we will get sore
i could show you the pieces
once you have her she will always be there
we got to save mother earth
and the mercy seat is burning
i am so hungry all the time
who need to get out of town
there is one shining eye on a hard-hat
if you read between the lines
one dead marine through the hatch
then i am blind and no one can see me
she is rubbing half the world against her thigh
you wished to god that you never went and took a look
where are you judy where are you anne?
where would you pick that up anyway?
i had the feeling of self-pity
i do not need to tear out my heart
yet they knew not what was wrong
truth is the flame we must burn
i love her love her love her
now both fire and flowers consume me
first we take manhattan then we take berlin
the good guys and the sinners
but you called me and i folded
you should see how it feels
at night they would go walking 'till the breaking of the day
i would just finished writing jubilee street
how lonely how lonely i could feel
a crow flew across the sky
wondering what our dreams might be worth
she spoke of silver from the sky
saying no it is a crime
let is roll all night long
how could this be about me
he says there will always be heart break
i could hear the sirens sound
i said i would write a letter
so we go ahead and the meters are over in the red
the usa ai not a free free place
my friends all tried to get me out
i ca not explain no i ca not explain
hey sister i feel it too
we ran by the water on the wet summer lawn
but i am still in love with you
i will never forget the sound that night
but the darkness got that too
realised the time is close for us to go
and still you give me everything
it says look! i am over here
i swear it happened just like this:
from the notes that i have made so far
a spider web it is tangled up with me
and i have crossed the line again
with folded arms the chief stood watching
weapons of mass distraction are used by politicians and conspiracy theorists
there is no more i can say to you
i am a big rock star
more than enough for me to share
bring back the water let your ships roll in
hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful black hair
and i wish you could have let me know
now you got both sides claiming killing in god is name
but they have not put their mittens on
trying to get out of the rain
you came to lift me up
i am sorry for my crimes against
is leaving never a thought for ourselves
is simply none of your concern
and 'you are all too late'
but in the pocket of the jacket is a chamber
sorrow is child you are loathe to befriend her
and i have got he screams
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries
put an end put an end
the only thing that she enjoys
written up in marker on a factory sign
and i know what is right
gonna save you fuckernot gonna lose you
it is like giving up hope
and to your little boy and to your little girl
we see so many tribes -- overrun and undermined
do not stay in a bad place
who said anything about it hurting?
do anything you say do anything you say
i would like to try to read your palm
a debt you pay with tears and pain
lifts a happy face to thank her
i fight the machine for the passers by
and then i am gonna really go far
i love you more i love you more for it
and i would rather play here
i forget what is out there
this song was played live in champaign il
lets take a breath try to put it aside
thank you for yanking me back to the fact that there is always something to
blue jean i just met me a girl named blue jean
late winter martin luther king day
oh can you see my love shining for you?
behind my beloved waterfall in the little room that was
they get so excited nothing get is in their way
enter john finn in his shrunken suit
she took over among furniture wax
the snakes and arrows a child is heir to
is this a love in disguise
but there is a price i have to pay
the shame as a hole that has kept us frozen
forever the master and the slave of his six strings
to cast its gold your way
i will leave up to you
i am gonna take two weeks
do not you want to feel like that
some just go to sleep at night
silently i turn and play begins
i am not quite sure what i am supposed to do
for the dirty ol' man latrine!
all the clocks have stopped in memphis now
the music is better than ever before
so we can catch and thread a minstrel bleed a tower down to it is ankles
in reverse we curse ourselves yeah
i was looking out the window
or get out of my life
now that you found yourself losing your mind
at which she turned her head away
and that is just torture to me
all the crap we had to take
o love are not you tired yet?
as the room is spinning oh
i want to live where the sun comes out
you would better learn your lesson well
out on the corner the angels say
so if you are sitting all alone and hear a-knocking at you door
and realise there is nothing much that i can do
i will be sitting in your mirror
i sometimes realizei could only be as good as you will let me
for the worst it has come to claim you
tortured all i should have done
i think you need some groovin'
do not talk of dust and roses
all the islands in the ocean
and i ai not no socialist
i started looking and the bubble burst
heavy and clever and full of demands
drink the blood of their so called best friend
poor mary thought that she might die
it is hard to play it safe
and if you want a doctor
you are a ladder to the sun
it will surely serve us well
remember they always let you down when you need 'em
roll down from my eyes for you
through the thick and through the thin
she looked up at me and began to smile
there are lambs for the slaughter
to even grab at the last straw
your great steady rock of gibraltar
pretend that i will make amends the next time
for no-one is left in doubt
well i am knocking on death is door
or the cliffs along the ocean
oh like a bird on the wire
well i have had it for now
that you have nowhere to go so go
i have got idols and icons unspoken holy vows
and a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
and put me in a cell
be the rain you remember fallin'
and i know that if there is a god above
ah but some of you was light
i had a dream of a different place
and when i go back to the house i hear that woman is mouth
all your tears were wept and done
the rush the overload overdose fuck it
well it makes me long for the good times
yeah with my feet on the trap and my head in the noose
i am a dreamin' man yes that is my problem
all that matters in the world
send me up to that wonderful world
that could count right up to eleven
but tell me can you hear my silent scream
yes i lost my little darlin'
long ago the mould was cast
there is no need to hide
ai not got no clothes to worry about no clothes to worry about
tryin' to find some piece of mind
i am not trying to tell you anything
will i take my rest in my sunday best?
down neon streets the streaker streaks
technology high on the leading edge of life
you can never be my bride
she lived on the curve of the road
that is 'xactly like that star he tore the town apart
if you ca not tell your sister
the cat is curled asleep in his chair
take my hand as we go down and down
west side of on the west coast
the things you dream you might do
i could not stop so i swerved to the right
how much you mean to me
everybody here is got somebody to lean on
ah was not it a strange way down?
my uncle has a country place
c amon and blow it a kiss now
just an hour or so to be safe from fear
when lovers chose each other now the perks are due
spin you round my little room miracle goodnight
i tried to leave you i do not deny
dances on the edge of his dream
yes he is very good looking
once had raised a sea that raged no more
later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
and the world will turn without you
they said that god was dead
of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone
her bloody prize sing o choirs of cacophony the king has
i ca not stop thinking big
i will just take it and go
and there are there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore
well i wonder if my children are thinking of me
'cause i wrote it ten times or more
and i keep on firing keep on firing keep on firing
we pull you from the water
i shall always watch you until my love runs dry
now you are punching and you are kicking
to what she used to be
are enough to leave a thousand cuts
he asked me to say goodbye
but from now i will be more faithful
of course the herd looks perfect!
i know i crumble when you are around
even though you are not here now
and the night over london lay
i do not think i want it at all
that explode at the moment i kissed you
and then die nothing is ever
in this one of many possible worlds all for the best or some bizarre test?
i was fighting in the sky
til the flesh rots off your bones
o o cabin fever! o o o cabin fever!
cause all i got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife
i am goin' down to geneva baby gonna teach it to you
karma man tattooed on your side the wheel of life
and you can never know me
and the rivers shall open for the righteous
but we have been through that a hundred times or more
she would never in a thousand years
jesus met the woman at the well
send your storm and your lightning to strike
he was looking at her from down on the floor
i have heard the creaking of the pearly gates above
if she picks on a dick
if you are lost and feel alone
can i stay here for a while?
sometimes i wonder if god laughs at me
do you think i am gonna crawl then think again
greek freighters are dumping crap somewhere right now
sweat running cold you ca not face growing old
break on through to the other side yeah
how i wondered where i would go
i will buy her furs and pretty things
and all the ones who go
i remember my friends always been found and i ca not
wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
just so i could pray again
and brother i ca not even remember the reason why
everybody is creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes
coming at my lap with rum and bitters
there is your long white neck
and the train ai not even left the station
hope is what remains to be seen
we clung to each other so very close
while half the world is stealing away
and someone to sweep the floors
and an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
there is a thin grey line
a love that wo not wait
sometimes it will take you right up and sometimes down again
with their red and golden paints
come back come back to me
fame fame fame fame fame fame fame
last night they loved you opening doors and pulling some strings angel
have to go and throw it all in my flame
small my table it sits just two
it is you and me babe against the world
i got a gun i got a gun
and her love is better than any other love i have known
and i watched her slipping away
putting on the black tie cranking out the white noise
rise life is in motion i am stuck in line
i will make you a believer
it ai not that in their hearts they are bad
there is just one thing we can do about it
that you are part of this scheme?
could you see the aisles of women?
they have been sentenced to death by the blues
and it was cold and it rained so i felt like an actor
so what can it possibly be?
dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
rise above all of the beautiful things
it went woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof
you lied to brother and me
all it takes is a little love
moving liquid yes you are just as water
plowing down man woman listening to its command
joanni joanni wears a golden cross
the measure of a life is a measure of love and respect
with your fist in my face
i ca not imagine what that means
driven off --- by things i have never seen
is that i love you so much
she knew he had to go
'cause lennon is on sale again
fulfill their needs just by being there
come up and be a kite
the god of balance you shall be
i see her face in the window
and you know he hates to lose
get me on my feet get some direction wo-ooh!
i was lost i was lost
oh there was not no reason no
a line i drew in sand
young girl they call them the diamond dogs
for he is defenceless without you
all i know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of all the things in life
when i take her to the dance
an angular mass of new yorkers
i seem to recognize your face
you know me so come closer
well i am gonna ask you babe
you were jesus christ my lord
and i wo not even touch you
for so long you have been strong
fame fame puts you there where things are hollow
put my hands up to the sky i am gonna fly
like she walked straight outa the book of leveticus
i have come up with riddles
and we will never know until we see
your love - could feel you put them on the ground
and show you hopes last sanctuary
all dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit
to tell if my choice is leaning up or down
ca not ride my broom no more
even though you are going through hell
and i hid him underneath the mattress
we pressed our faces to the glass
if i had not met ramona
and they head for the plain
just another guy on the lost highway
brought tales of old to light
she is got me with that feline 'guise
oh no do not say it is true
and a bad-blind nigger at the piano
you want me to burn away
telling me i got to beware
i should have know there was someone else
and i still hold some ashes to me
if you want to be with me
like the video films we saw
oh my love oh my love oh my love
sorrow is child invites you under
when this world is trying it is hardest
sir i did not see nothing i was just getting home late
the way you roll them eyes
some of them fell into heaven
will want will want will want
but i can see that your eyes are glass
do not it make them question their faith?
as if you have been run through
in my heart it will never be spring
assis au bord des flots sitting by the flowing waters
oh did not i say i am not one of you
to put it all down and start again
that old river poet that never ever ends
tell me now oh beautiful and spacious
if i asked you one more time
rock and roll is here to stay
that i could never go on without you
she was a beauty in a cage
go right to the white rose
hunt you to the ground they will mannequins with kill appeal
i have got more friends than i had out for dinners
play v let the song protest
just watch the face your sure to see
and tonight rivers will run dry
not a shirt on my back not a penny to my name
to a place where no one can betray you
he loosened it so if it slipped between my breasts
that you swore through your teeth
and beyond the reach of my hands
there is no time for laughing
well what do you expect from
i would not sign my autograph
would be the boss of me
sometimes i swear i can still hear her howl
the north is to south what the clock is to time
i do not need to touch
to make bright and clear your path
like spirits living so far away
but you are sure it is not right
i got a heart full of soul i got a heart full of soul
be sure to close the barn door
why does our pride make us weak?
got to get that message home
it is nearly killing me but what a lovely feeling!
the boy pulls down his baseball cap
tried to say in my own way
come and throw your weight around
and i knew something was wrong
a look on the other side
river running like an open sore
why do not you come on back to the war pick up your tiny burden
tears his eyes from the screen
of men who claim to know all
it is a question of lust
it is all through without exemption
ooh yes babe i said i am coming
i can see the green grass growin' on the hill
up here so high i start to escape
the sands run red in lands of the pharaohs
ai not never felt so all alone
there is much more than this ooh whoa much more than this
i will send your love to zeus
a figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he is clogged and clothed in saffron
they are setting fire to the cornfields
when you have got to go on waiting
a storm on a raging course
oh would i ever let you down
well homegrown is all right with me
we have been running around in circles all year
and you know i am strong and holy
cut the crying and the see-through tear
on the wall yeah oh that is all
me knowing the truth i cannot concur na-na
some say that heaven is hell
i woke up this morning and got myself a beer x
this is the song of solomon
the school boy told the woman in the street
that i cling to with my fingers
if you miss the train i am on
standing like a saint upon its deck
there is no bread let them eat cake
if thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
you put me on a line
a little folding of the hands to sleep
any new realizations would have to wait
rain it down on the house where we live
the televisions on and i am walking throught the yard
behind the curtain of sleeping eyes
swoop down from the sky and catch me like the bird to prey
they will never understand our culture
now that god is in the house
i keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
but the lord himself would blush
i heard an old song playing on a radio
let is talk let is talk let is talk
i wo not let my dreams slip away from me
'tis done in brighter corners now
a billion other voices are spreading other news
for you -- the blind who once could see
every lift of my hand coffee cup up and back
i pick up the phone and go execute
we only know in theory what we are doing
like an angel i live alone
who cares who cares what the future brings?
you may not feel me bawling out
i am not the same without you here
hush up hush up my parrot she cried
i have got a livin' that is rough a future that is tough
i will be well in touch
just think in five years he will be shaving
i am the black crow king
i will take the vermin is path oh and i must refuse your test
i would stay where my last step left me
this just ca not be understood
they think the lord of me
you walked into the ball of fame
the choice between darkness and light
i am gonna shoot my baby i caught her messin round with another man
and the miracle that was promised
good things are coming our way
i will pull you out of there
and all of those birds would have sung to your beautiful heart
such a wind was blowing that day
for it is breathless without you
when i hold you in my arms
hello you no more this talk of
oh oh i have i have seen your face before
the podium rocks in the crowded waves
oh he left it alone drilled the pain with money to buy
when the sun goes down when the sun goes down
begging me to play my games
and the wind did howl and the wind did blow
it is a big illusion but at least you are in
i see they surround me i see
good night good night my fallen star
i long to be by the sea where a blossom falls from a cherry tree
well i had to tell you then
i know he loves another lady
gonna take me an astral plane
visits the home of the brave
with the ones that missed their chances
you say you are kind of restless now and it is on account of him
though it is just a memory
and you would retreat from the front of your eyes
here i hide in the heart of the city
it is medicine for the soul
i turn around but you are gone
from the fires of the homeless
i am so high the sky i scrape yeah
angels and demons dancing in my head
i am questioning my own equation
i never knew a man could tell so many lies
i got so lost on the shore
i am on a roll now
as the flames of eternity rise
last night i heard you making love to him
well pretty soon i met a friend
i know you know what you are doing to me
and they wonder why the maples
i am the fiend hid in her skirts
the present is not that pleasant
some old man said 'just do your best'
let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore
take a look at unselected cases
the gambler tips his hat and walks towards the door
we had not driven very far
people just ai not no good
i am thankful for my country home
i would be back on my feet
because i do not deserve any
and in some kind of dream
can you feel me inside? i do
i got ready for the struggle
but there is gonna be a meter on your bed
and what shall she do with thursday is rags
i feel i do not believe and now the truth is coming out
if you never try then you will never know
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
i just got my ticket today
would you tell her for me
it is coming like the tidal flood
this is her dress that i loved best
i need your love to get through
she hates her life and what she is done with it
my heart is really on its knees
kiss them all but you wo not recover
all i feel makes me unforgiven
i have been everything i can be
i meant them like the rest
i guess i should i feel i should get real get real
the sun would stream on the sheets
to determine who will serve and who will eat
but i am ready to make a deal
i would rather rather be oh
so set your restless heart at ease
life as short as the falling snow
i turn away from the light
but what the fail to see is that your games are the key
when i get home i am gunna give up the booze
he is a fat little insect
and then it leaves my dreams again
and no one is ever wrong
it moves towards a higher plane
ooh what a waste of all that
doing this and that and getting nowhere
they said that timing was everything
i feel love is wheels turning
some say that knowledge is something that you never have
get well get well said she
i know your trembling hand your guilty prize
i have lost a few more hairs
un jour triste et pensif one day sad and pensive
you can live in grace and comfort
does it get you where you wanna go
if you ca not solve the problem come and tell me to my face
and why are you so quiet now
but you pay me no attention
we can only bow to the here and now
where is your famous golden touch?
i have learned some new things
vacate is the wordvengeance has no place so near to her
well i will try not to hold you
let me start with you miss shy
i have got to use her got to use her
if i could learn to twang like a rubberband
broken our hearts call for you
like lovers and heroes and the restless part of everyone
hear the tones can you hold
everyone of us has a heaven inside
i like to look in your eyes
but there is nothing i would ever alter
come back and look for me
i got thrown out of bible school
the air grows heavy i listen to your breath
that it is either black or white
i wo not be here for long
it is it is warhol actually
ai not no use to stay and make a stand
just a man just a man
life is changing everywhere i go
god is in the houses and god is in my head
all the love all the love
there is a universe between us now
there is nothing over there but vengeance
i can feel it in my bones
i look up and the camera eye is
i am okay i have seen the lighter side of life
i am like a white man
ooh and the sun will shine
from a doorway says you got time?
i ca not turn the other cheek
dreamers learn to steer by the stars
and when we meet it still gets in my way
to paint that love upon a white balloon
while we have got that little life
you ca not touch them no 'cause they are all spies
with what you are being put through
how dark the night spent apart?
forever at the heel of your boot
be what you want to be
but then we move like tigers on vaseline
poor you i know what you gonna do
i am going away for a little while
or curled up into a ball
truth is after all a moving target
but she ca not make it with the boy she really wants to be with
he was sure he was right
you can sit and you can drink your champagne
i am singin' this borrowed tune
the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
it is evidently hard to find at night
just sittin' and talkin' to heart and ticks
be with my girl [repeat ad lib]
against the run of the mill
could be the truth it becomes you
just take good care of the world
they are gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off
he is gonna grow to be an angry young man some day
for something a little more plain
the way you told me love is blind
the pleasure seems to balance out the pain
sent me to the streets with the good time girls
not the end not the end
we had this bright idea one late summer night
i would love you to strangers
that is how it is meant to be
it starts when you are always afraid
it started out as a bit of fun
i am a dead man walking a dead man walking a dead man walking
then lay your rose on the fire
i blow you a cold kiss
with no words with no song
has not heard from his deck hands
got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and i dig everything - dig
with the photographs there and the moss
black clouds flow through gray still skies
their knee in your balls and their fist in your face
do back the things it did to you in return
while you are still on the stand
we will fire up the willing engine
too dark to find the garden of eden
for the holy one dreams of a letter
but no one is ever taken me
in new york i took your photograph
i wish i had that instinct
he will reach deep into the hole
whisper words of wisdom let it be
it is just started to snow
i could say it is all for you
you could hear them climbing the stairs
so i asked this lovely creature
what a pity you left us so soon to climb your mountain of regret
your face just ghostly in the smoke
she will run back in fright
how i am moved how you move me
and it is crowded and cold
running back to cover your neck
as we make our own few circles 'round the sun
we teach old hearts to rest
it is all ching it is the whole thing the tv is
and there is not a fire that i would not walk through
i can no longer hear you
that towers over the uncaring ground
be pleading for some teenage sex yeah
i have never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby
i am from a new land
oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo hoooo
he can put a target on the market
nothing is gonna save us from the big drop
you say you have gone away from me
we do not know but you ca not run away from it
that does not mean i am going to trust you too far
that all the rain clouds are fountains
and the swallows swooped and the starlings warned us
i believe that what i am feeling
morning star you are beautiful yellow dime on high
japan and china all lit up
hey little train! we are jumping on
you can tell me that i got no class
standing at the edge of you
if we have only got this life
we are real you can touch
that is going to save the world now
there was no premonition of the wet hog is back
in the window of the old appliance store
such a fuss to get nowhere at all
when you get off at your station alone
shined at me frome the depths of her hair of deepest black
my time has come i am undone
and was not it a long way down
i said i said i said i said i said i said
and every day he has to pay in every way
and we lived in an endless night
i feel i am in the mood
in this life that we live
said do you feel it when you touch me
where is mathew now it is getting dark?
to go and paint big cities
oh hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
she prepares to go to bed
that one day we will be living in the stars
and i would howl at your beauty
silently i feel you breathe on me
of the girl that i once knew
there will be the breaking of the ancient
looks like i ca not just the thought of you
his mother had told him a trip was a fall
now look what we have put you through
it is a picture of hitler
time to take heed and change directions
chilly down with the fire gang hey shake your pretty little head
and i danced to the western world
i could only observe where the trouble starts
with no conscience repentance oh no
oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
my hands below the belt or my hands above
it is true that all the men you knew were dealers
sometimes it feels like i am alone
stepping out off the page into the sensual world
do i have to dance all night?
you do not even try to prove that the noisy neighbor is making love [?]
gonna write a song and see how a woman feel
but her mummy is yelling no
i never thought i could act this way
he looked just like a girl
he will extend his hand real slowly for a shake
they are gonna lay me low lay me low
so tell me you love me
alabama you got the weight on your shoulders
but you do not know it
words can leave you broken inside
i knew that it was wrong
light a fire light a spark
i lift my voice and pray
and like a blessing come from heaven
this girl is made of lipstick
we we are weak and the fear
and the last time that i saw her she was living with some boy
let is try to keep it short
now this wretch in beggars clothing
and stared deep into the abyss and said
oh my love the dawn is breaking
now i have turned the mirrors to wall
because i am gonna buy this place and see it burn
if that sky serves as his eyes
party time one mor night everybody is affected
whom you still praise and blame
and they ask you how you are doing
and by the time i make oklahoma she will be sleeping
compassion with the sting of iodine
let is hit the road and go to town
they take me deeper and deeper
but i will be there for you
and please sir make it whiskey
but do i have to dance all night?
you make my heart ba boom ba boom boom
he worked 'til his fingers wore to the bone
yeah my friends are gone and my hair is gray
i do not know who to trust anymore
and turn that big black engine home
sometimes i fear that the whole world is queer
fontainebleau well i guess i will see
all this pain and all the sorrow
oh have i seen you before?
someday yet he will begin his life again
i hear you screaming well at least you try
but life is just a party and parties were not meant  last
ooh babe i said i am running
symbols on a field of visions
as well make our own few circles 'round the block
and i am such a heel for makin' her feel so bad
the birds are all gone where did they go?
and waited for me to reply
and saying not a moment too soon
making the rounds ten miles a day
they say hey that is really something
the ebb and flow of tidal fortune
it was like a book he read in his sleep endlessly
but the rumors of my virtue
god is been good to me never to be too late
oh maybe oh maybe lie down
'cause when all the water is gone
it would not stay with them
and to shun the company of strangers
ooh just gimme it quick gimme it gimme gimme gimme gimme!
she stood beside me once again
ah start to cry ah start to cry
look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen seventies
everybody is talking about the state of the nation
well it is a fragile tension
it is good to see you
something warm flowing through my eyes
telling me she is dead against it
a blackened tooth a scarlet fog
every time i thought i would got it made
i am gonna make you make you make you bleed'
well i am coming back to me love
that is one more time around the sun is going down
and i am wondering what i am doing in a room like this
you have just become his brand new toy
and i have heard every lie
against the voice of doom failures fall all over town
some will sell their dreams for small desires
soon are all gonna work out
it is gonna make me make me make me bleed
yeah you! it takes a little more persistence
it is all caked and cracked along the rim
the closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
any way you will never know
lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
i said that time may change me
this particular diamond was extra special
there is nothing i can say
the one you call messiah is a lie
up to the highest point of the city
i walked in light when you held me in that night
but you never even see me do you
her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor
you are so full of what is right
i hoped i would misplace it
some say that knowledge is ho ho ho
do not ask me 'how are you?'
and the glimpse of a face at morning
but do not push my limits too far
see your stars begin to shine
la-la la la la la la-la
it is how you look and how you feelwhy do i
it is no secret but that woman fills my loving cup
as the trees bend down their branches
up in the tower they are watching me hoping i am gonna die
how did we get to be this far apart?
i have not found by myself
i practiced every night now i am ready
c amon and let me live!
yeah i said roll baby roll
well he never saw the sun
full moon and a jumpin' tune
with the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah
you will find me in a berlin bar
he will always love you he said
he was born eleven years ago
prepare yourself for the fall you are gonna fall
or do you feel like you just got carried away?
feeling like there is something i never thought you would be part of
hold me darling just a little while
that time has come and gone now it is just me
i guess the heat got to it dripped and melted all over the floor
take him up to the highest high
captured all the hearts and minds
and where am i to die?
look the storm in the eye
my hands are reaching for you everywhere
tell is what is going on leading us along
or the colors shine too bright
and i put him in a matchbox
no i will never give the hunt up
but you would not believe what i have been through
i would not have lost you another way
wait for the postman and the telephone
these four walls are closing in
i would tell you about the things
'cause my rescue is gonna be here soon
yea i will be hanging upside down and here i will swing
wake up mornings where is my little china girl
that keeps the hunter the harm
see the strange boy keeping to the shadows
he made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree
i was swimming away out to sea
two rubberbands wo not keep you up
old enough now to change your name
drive away into the setting sun?
i want to run when i am up high
that i never sang to one man before
oh and the memory is always getting clearer
learning to catch the heat of the third world man
do you want to feel how it feels?
she had a mindful of tyranny and terror
then i will be ten feet tall then you will be nothing at all
and you hang on hang on hang on
i do not care what you say
when you are written in mine
i am not saying that they are wrong
rock and rollin is a scream makin' millions my dream
you know it rolled me right along
we are calling out for middle street
we killed the angels that warned us of you
looking for tomorrow is time peace of mind
oh look there is a man inside
from the skies you could almost hear them cry
when i think of what he is done
i will wear a mask for you
kept on rollin' kept on rollin'
i saw her going down underneath
should i try to make a date
but i do not know how to deal with you
and i could write it down
so can it happen for me?
when i  am away i call you up
she dressed herself in sailor is clothes
song but i think it is a traditional also known as 'i wish i was an apple'
or a lucky shot in the dark
the lord is my shepard i shall not want
and the rain that is burning
blood running down the inside of her legs
and your body is some little highway shrine
show me the place where the word became a man
so i took you twice on our first night
so now i take the opportunities
i would rather starve than eat your bread
leave me alone let me rock and roll
start to mumble a bit of a false sound
so lets be married one more night
my falsity had stung me like a hornet
how is our mother to damn these contributors
when all on my mind was love
and all of you have seen the dance
so onward! and onward! and onward i go!
and a gilled jesus shivering on a
but there were so many people you just had to meet
i am a dj i am what i say
she does not like the view [repeats]
oh yes and cried some bad tears
i walked the line when you held my hand that night
there is an anger in my heart
then i must have asked the wrong question
blue blue windows behind the stars
i punch the air and fight but
leave a light a light on
dark all my dark for light
you must have a heart of steelwhy do i
now see the shark how red his fins are
it is every day it is not [?] baby
has got me walkin' on these
face it in you or me
i got some news for you do not even need you too
i heard that love was out of my control
why do i keep fuckin' up?
my mirrored room my secret life
sounds more like a voice in my head
you see her face in every crowd
and our love become a funeral parlor
and i will make them disappear
we have a random on the westside
you see there is nothing here i have found
show me the right way to go
here am i i really do not feel quite sane
hidden beneath the cave i found it i brushed away the
a miracle once in a while
talk to me! talk to me! please baby talk to me!
could it be my babe could it babe?
i would stop and talk but i am already in love
a spider web and i am caught in the middle
let me bring in the memories!
we gather up our hearts and go
when it all comes down to dust
but it can be so bright
just bury me out on the prairie
turned to my nemesis a fool no fucking god
wide eyes would clean and dust
if any of you officers would like to say a word
and love followed just behind me
city lights at a country fair
i set the clouds in motion
that wo not accept the red one
are you a puddle full of detriment? oh
i am sat here lickin' my ruins
baby do not you ask yourself why?
recalling all the children dancing at our feet
and things are looking much better
then i would taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth
the ones you fear are wind and air
it will swell up burst it is banks
its stink it fouls the highways
cause i am what i am and what will be will be
put out the fire and do not look past my shoulder
let me steal this moment from you now
and i say to myself you are a fool fool fool
we have taken care of everything
soon i was seeing visions and cracks along the walls
what is the meaning of this?
and stabbed the backs of fathers
but then i overheard your prayer
lovers on corners clean my sheets
stare in the darkness stare in the doom
ice cold drinks get sold tonight
at the turn of the century i did many things to protect myself
so you will never see scribbled on the bathroom wall
i hated you i loved you too
cause you did not work a lick
except a man dear lord who looked like you
with a shoal of herring amongst the sails
the spies hide out in every corner
comes a time when you are driftin'
well all that glitters is not gold
i said i do not need them to make life work
the toughest role you ever played
these must be the flags of freedom flyin'
there is a war between the left and right
well i feel so good i feel like i wanna play with you
and me if you can believe this at the wheel of the car
i got superstitious about you but i ca not take change
wish the world could glow again with love
yeah there will be an answer let it be
oh girl my problems ca not follow me
but they are all i can find
i knew that i could break you somehow
when you thought that it was over
when i am not with you
five five five five five against one said
so completely filled with light she was
you can sleep in bus shelters
i saw a rippling in the water
look at arthur rave all the kids are paid
the more you looked into my eyes the more you lied
i only know i am wrong
but i do not love you
she wears her body like a coffin
you can almost feel the current flowing
we could leave in the morning
if you know a little bit about my past
my dim chance of skipping this thick world is thin
to what you are going through
or none of it is true
what is got the whole world fakin' it?
and colors turn to gray he is stayin'
i ca not remember everything i do
say he who rides a pony must someday fall
i see it in the new sun rising
two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl
when it is time to say goodbye
i have even seen men cry
with his vaseline and his violin and bow - mojo
but careful what you are giving
haunting familiar yet i ca not seem to place it
and i have seen my heart break
as you slowly died of boredom
do you know what i mean?
like a ship on the ocean
i must admit just when i think i am king
taking me where i want to be
she would say oh oh oh oh oh oh
if i do not git rye whiskey i think i will die
the flame at the heart of a pawnbroker is diamond
people welcome to the big room
what should have been our armor
i will never get it right
[and the ]point where shall i go
no wonder they do not understand
and he gave the wire a pluck
everybody knows the scene is dead
paint her name on a one-way street
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
there is too many of you dying
use your arms to hold me tight baby i do not wanna fight no more x
i am not a quitter baby
a little sleep a little slumber
it is coming through a hole in the air
how is our father supposed to be told?
where even richard nixon has got soul
we do not need opinions and rumours
but i ca not think of anything to do
the world is the world is
the boys are like baby-faced boys
come a ky ky yippee yi yippee yi ay
a little love a little hate babe
yeah i live for this feeling this everglow
and with fear in my guts like tangled twine
do i hope or do i fear?
a good man driven from his homeland
before you slip slip slip away
i am out of my head ca not take it
i will take that plane tonight
all the things you do to me
and i thought i saw you
wo not you come and sit with me
i would lie still you move i would send you off around the bend
my mouth on the dew of your thighs
come on and let the people know
it is hard for one to know
there is one more dead with a hole in his head
think i will get back on the highway
and it is good to be alone
let me say just once that
the situation makes me kind of nervous
you know i am still livin' in town
if i only had a potion
battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
and i say to myself i am a fool
so much i want to see
i will be there when i teach what i have been taught
and i am full of love
more things than are dreamed about
oh in the tower of song
it is true we are always there
and you are only just beginning
silent and stern in the sweltering night
she is got a trail of men that she takes
harm is in us [repeat: x]
i want to cross over i want to go home
i did not see much happiness or pain
soaked to the skin soaked to the skin
i love you badly just in time
get up and scream ah oh!
and if by chance i wake at night and i ask you who i am
and me i am up there waiting
off you dream my little childthere is a sun around the bend
he spoke of things i have yet to find
big money weave a mighty web
get the balance right get the balance right
and the waist did swell of pretty nell
ooh they just ask for more and more and more and more and more and
gettin' in an old black car
do not say you are happy
i can go anywhere i want to go
the smell of her black hair upon my pillow
chris feat bono on all star tribute
your pretty dress is oil stained
g arrives funny had a feeling he was on his way
get out of the waves! get out of the water!
you know the back of my hand
dressed like a priest you was
i am told that this is called 'the sickness of need'
o you kings of halls and ends of halls
me i retired to a back street flat
and it is not too hot
only sleep brings you back to life yeah
the chain so sick rims so thick c amon!
remember me i brought your groceries in
at a quarter past a holy no
shake up the state shake like it is earthquake
she is got a sister out in vegas
racing down a river from the past
everyday i have wished away oh please please take away my pain
if i only could be running up that hill
a guiding star beats a spirit in the sky
in the milk of human kindness
i got a love gonna fill you up
i wish you could help me up
those bonfire lights in the mirror of sky
said what i believe with my soul
well midnite came and clock did strike
puts me in heaven that is exactly how i feel
one rubberband wo not keep you up
like to know what is what
not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry?
i find it on my run in a race that ca not be won yeah
i will apply them all to thee
three days and maybe longer wo not even know i have left
full of blood loving life and all it is got to give
people out on the streets they do not know who i am
i am right by your side
it is written on the walls of this hotel
let us die to make things cheap
and everywhere the flare of iodine
blue blue windows behind the stars
i have been flyin' down the road and i have been starvin' to be alone
we marvel after those who sought
smoking grass while the summer passed
when your dreams are in the past
how much do these suppers cost?
oh baby lay down your arms x
all the doctors swallowed up by one incompetence
and i am neither left or right
oh honey i ca not believe your lyin'
i will give you eyes of blue
the colors turn to gray this day
how can anyone be so loving
well i have never felt such pleasure
and different people have different needs
dom do aaah gee it is hot let is go to bed
that you saw a guy without any shoes
a white house a white room
oh your chains are too dark
i got some friends that i could go to working for
in some hallway where love is never been
you have fallen oh my star
it is hard to get blood from a stone
till you are tied up and you are spell bound
with a blue sky overhead and nothing else
dressed up in the mask of comedy
now i am finding out that it is so confusin'
see the mice in their million hordes
i never think about the last
like we are back in the dark ages
for the gifts that she will sell
said he must have been mad to leave you
be for real wo not you baby
and looks like forever in the first place
alone you will meet the one who lies in wait
yeah well if you are so sorry come up and take my place
stealing a god from a muslim too
what is really going on below
now it is come to this
come on let is all join in
oh this country sure looks good to me
say goodbye my one true lover
and the night-time in which he is wrapped
does god bleed on the word?
oh turn up the music and smile
and her hair rolled in a curl
people they ai not no good
we stood beneath an amber moon
like an eagle you circled in perfect purple
share in a memory of gray
saint huck! saint huck! saint huck!
that i could never forget the way
it seems that i have blackened the family name
it is four in the morning the end of december
at night it was the bright of the moon with me
i wo not be breaking no rocks
and i ca not get free
nobody knows her or knows her name
my mirror is tarnished with no-help
but she can smile just the same
sometimes i fall sometimes i do not
i cannot move i cannot hide
i had a dreadful diehood diehard drunken sunken monk-heart
and they will head you off when you touch the ground
there is no light over london today
and everything could have been perfect
i guess it was the beatings made me wise
the big shots try to hold it back
and the sun is set the sun will rise another day
ooh that red white 'n blue
see them as they really are
to float upon the surface of the eaten soil
where they do not know my name
but we have been through this a hundred times or more
while the gate to the kingdom swings
with a big bouquet of cactus
the sun is high up in the sky and i am in my car
and they looked the other way
love is lost and lost is love
you have been trailing failing me with you are
and just like you i bet he can dance
to find the sacred river alph
and in my hour of darkness
said he will see me on the flipside
is it any wonder i reject you first?
it is all flash it all costs it is all green
i know my days are few
where there is trouble there is poetry
and say 'it means i can feel'
shifting the river-trade on that ol' steamer
'cause i built my life around you
there is tic toc in atomic
ah well that is where i would be
it is oceans that i want
and in the safety of the night
the more i disregard the signs the more i fly
like a dream she has taken me
i been digging in the frozen ground
but i never want to hold you down
till you feel you are safe and sound
the light came through the window
it could take me all of my life
and nothing is left to warn me
i will forget who you are
there is a voice that sounds like god to me
the moment between us the fire is made now harder to touch
only one man could be seen
and empty chair where dad sits
such a lot of pain on this earth
and do not ever hold me down
and borrow for a little more
swept away like voices in a hurricane
they are knocking now upon your door
as your bony fingers close around me
o not on sunday is slave
here to be done as we do
we will find a way we will find our place
though i saw it all around
thy kingdom is will be done
i am so afraid that i listen to you
baby baby baby please do not leave here
how tides control the sea and what becomes of me
she sees here brother marchin' by
oh lordy oh lordy you know i need some loving
i am not dreaming of the past
dressing up in costumes playing silly games
we talk of love and trust
the sun the solitude the cemetery
in any one place for very long
yes i can hear your young
is this the way to learn?
and you never let yourself go again with me
remember once upon a time when i was
gone the roof overhead but the sky was always there
a man can lose himself in a country like this
i said look around the rooms taller now
like grapes on a hedgehog that rolls in the grass
to where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burn
if they do not take that game
and she is honest to me
and i got nowhere else to go
you know i am a forgiver
she just hollers what she wants from where she is at
could those dreams of yours be true
i just ca not stand to see you dragging down
it is a battle with the bottle
got me a big wave ride me a big wave got me a big wave
will you be short with her will you make her read those little bibles
all the world is indeed a stage
i was never any good at loving you
you do not know me from the wind
are probably typos each set of two lines is one line in the lyric book ie
where i would already been around
you put a gun in my head
when i find myself in times of trouble
every muscle tense to fence the enemy within
and if the 'friends' all go home
of smoke and gold and breathing
he turns on one tap to discover
deep in the green lilac park
something rings a bell and it is all over
the troubles that you have had
it was not you it was mothers' day
wo not do what you want me to
but sorrow and a sense of overtime
you cai not hurt me anymore
in the dark before the dawn
'cause i believe there is a place
you are still alive she said
and i want to talk to you all of you
come to me with downcast eyes
to go howling through the night
i feel a wreck without my little china girl
you are gonna get it right some time
and her breasts rise and fall
o let the heavens hear it
religious extacy and a blossom falling from a cherry tree
put your hand over the side of the boat
follow our stars under a painted sky
but never has my tormenter come in such a cunning disguise
is no longer me at all
where no man before could be bothered to go
i scaled the frozen mountain tops
though we know that time has wings
and now they just want me to be quiet
i really do not want to know that
with just one hand held up high
everybody searching for a little piece of gold
i look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
if i lend it to you would you keep it safe for me
it is coming for me through the trees
he is the music of my life
get some on my finger and take in its smell
so much so much so much!
and you held her in the shadows
hey babe say you are mine all mine
let is call in an angel
my song is love is love i know
the sun and the moon meet on yon hill
'cause you are all grown-up now
before i start to fade away
a new song on the radio
yeah fall the world is her fall break her fall
i get a buzz from being cold and wet
is telling us she is having your baby
i wished i had a future anywhere
i will sell my guilt to your need
i got a lion in my pocket
i am turning tricks i am getting fixed
and turns to a river inside
do you know what the reunion pays for you?
how is the view from the fence?
maybe she should not see this
i want for to lay down i am waiting 'till sundown
all of the birds are laughing
showing things that i would never seen
just tell nancy not to come here
what you are praising him for
i do not claim to understand
i will light the match this mornin' so i wo not be alone
like a hero on a platform of friends
no more free steps to heaven
join the army you can see the world
i watch the moon get flayed anew
the beauties is old but still as good she said
i am giving it all giving it giving it
i am alright i feel good
ooh it is hard on the man
and it is stronger than drink
wish you could lift me up
i would surely like to know before it is over
i ca not wait to see you again
[to help my friend and foe]
we could be hanging around here for centuries
i am that bad motherfucker called stagger lee
and cried what have i done?
sweep the streets i used to own
and i have got to say that i just do not get it
i have been waiting so long
just starin' in each others' eyes
look around this world we made
i do not know what the time is
so look me over baby last you will see of me
one more step to the top of the city
you will never know the real story
carry further than the word is heard
the company closed down the mine
a devil in your bleeding face
did what i did said what i had to say
i send the skins of my sins out to cover and comfort you
it is love that chooses me
through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
oh i never meant to do you wrong
like you would do for one your love
our clothes are on the beach
on this road of sin are you sorrow bound
then she smiled and turned to me
a little dark-eyed girl drifted past
a sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer
so i approach with tactsuggest that he should relax
and feasting is always somewhat sad
and i am crazy for loving you
harm in us but power to arm
stop the swing of the pendulum
who looks in need of sleep
all i see is cold and hard
why must i self-indulge in memories?
and i have heard dark rumours
i will stay until you try to tie me down
they ca not take any more
ooh i will wake up to any sound of engines
where the morning rain do not fall and the sun always shines
on the wrong day of the wrong week
it was not me i am just a plain and simple singer
better people -- better food -- and better beer
try to get through but not be through
sometimes i speak of nothing at all
mom and daddy never liked to stay
down athenaeum lane to the cathedral
i dream of wires the old days
you are running out on reality
down the beckonin' streets of op-po-tunity
my senses have gone awol awol awol awol awol
coming at her like lazarus from above
and watch them turn on me
suck me dry suck this dry
'til the stench was just revolting
took a trip on a gemini spacecraft
i will always be waiting for you
with the thrust on the strand
oh well my mom and poppa told me son
i stuck a six inch gold blade inside the head of a girl
mother where are the angels? i am scared of the changes
cause love is my bet and it is the best yet
the night does not like it
come here it comes there it goes when it comes
done with life on a razor is edge
i could say it is all for you
damn thing was blind bam-e-lam x
treating her real fine thus i am home being a loner
if you drop that halo that you are wearing on the ground
how many times have you heard but you ca not believe a word
i will call out your name
i would tune into some friendly voices
trickles then picks up the pace
till you will be a man
and all that is to come runs in
i just ca not stand still i have got to use her
i will speak from my heart
paint the night with battle cries
for the one and only once
alas my love you did me wrong
i was not there dear hiding all away
with the lords and high ladies
hold me tight do not let go
and every now and then we try
one by one they enter there
i know i could be something if i held on held on
how it breaks my heart to leave you
is still important for us though we realise
i see your curves and i feel your vibrations
and the swallows have sharpened their beaks
oh darling of angels demons and saints
and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
get my feet wet in the ocean
we are a little more relaxed at this little
it goes on all day long
notch by notch winter by winter
you it is you and me
we are goin' out to the movies
like a shadow in the dark
i have got it wrong wrong wrong
'no red skins no blacks and that means you baw! '
whose code was broken crucifix uncrossed
passion flaming in my heart yeah
who is never quite sure what he is moved towards
i was walking around the flower show like a leper
slide on over here let me give you a squeeze
from the castles in the distance
every child is mother holds an ice-cream cone they circle round
and while he talks his dreams to sleep
the chains are locked and tied across the door
back in the ussr do not matter where you are
with his beatles and his stones
but you will be hearing from me baby long after i am gone
like a stranger coming out of the rain
jack said a home is not a hole
there she stands there she stands
the voice of doom was shining in my room
it is so easy to choose
they ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
now forever we will live as one
just make it go away now
you see i i do not want to be hurt by love again
so i was with you o sweet compassion
and now i am climbin up the ladder with a scaffold peg
you see no meaning to your life
lost on a road he knew by heart
and it hangs in the gallery of frost
footsteps in the hall it was you youoh
but for you i will give it a try
and they are never gonna stop
the nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass
yeah people welcome to the big room
and i will make it all worthwhile
they gain the light they formlessly entwine
heroes leaving for the great crusade
i do not like to go down to flats
everybody wants to hang your ass
for telling me that son of a bitch kept it home after dawn
suspended in your bleak and fishless sea
i hear you in my head
what can this thing be that i found?
so much it do not show
and fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head
and let is just beat it up
jo the waiter worked for me
and then you can play with me
here where time and space collide
and if she says to you that she do not love me
gonna drive back down where you once belonged
can i be here all alone?
i swear i recognize your breath
and still be cast a lie
do not like to crash climb climb
and all of my teeth are bared
tell me a secret i am sure to fall
despair and deception love is ugly little twins
but you will never be forgiven
there is no end to what they will take
hear the crocodiles ticking round the world
i am going away for a little while
and i am coming for you!
they want a piece of the action
and feel your arms surrounding me
when it feels like the end of my world
oh that is the price that you pay
she will pay the rent for the use of you
i wish that i could pay for my crime
aahdo not even think about gettin' inside
if i could have her tonight
in the back of my car
i am afraid i ca not
how you lost it what went wrong
she sat in a wicker chair her eyes they were downcast
i pulled on my coat and buttoned it up
and though you might be gone and the world may not know
come on baby do not let it
she was playing a part that i could understand
one more drink and then goodbye
that keep on slipping right through our hands
and on and on and on
it is time to relax now and then give it hell
but you need not get heavy with them
we miss you day and night
my masquerade of trust was iodine
lives opened and trashedlook ma watch me crash
and i let my missles fly
this is where i want to be
oh i dream of one caress
stop now what is that sound
put a bullet in my brain
a chip off the corner stone
spinning in the chair at abbey road
and it made me love you
give the kid the pick of pips
they get so excited nothing gets in their way
be sure the hidden enemy will escape from the kingdom
all he ever gives us is pain
with no one there to hold him
now the storm has passed over me
to a new home in the sun
i know you ca not be
so i know i will be hunting high and low
so here i am in the alleyway
the sky is blue dream that lie 'till it is true
when the gas in my tank feels like money in the bank
there is nowhere to hide in your dreams
the sky wore a veil of gold and gray
and it is once for the devil and once for christ
but that is the way all my friends are
do not miss the brightest star
let is hit the road and go to town
but that wo not stop you itching
and my love would come to blows
where the canada geese once filled the sky
the l of the lips are open
when you walked up to me and you said
and i ai not no democrat
i get home at five o'clock
office in a sidestreet is no place for you
she says 'i have seen you before
now the scaffold is high and eternity is near
they will ride you off your feet
baby we are gonna have ooh baby baby baby
he thinks he is well screened from the man at the top
oh man that is for sure
it is true that love can change us
it is such a fine line
she is going out her way
but the story is still the same
and then we will have our living made
to think a sailor lad should have
i am heading way down south where i can be free
and make you just like the rest
the walls are bad black bottom kind
yeah they came to take me away
it says it wo not leave me alive for long
as long as you are still smiling
a year is really more like seven
and all the lights were turned down low
it is you and me babe
unskilled hands that knew no trade
all those signs i knew what they meant
yesterday always too good to forget
you sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
next mornin' sun was up at dawn
how i can get back to thee
jazzers paid by j paul getty ii
they took her body in a coffin
that the moon is steeped in mild nad blood
she said i am ready for you
when i see you standing there
yeah too bad he was a psychopath and now i am the next in line
i am finally on my way
i have lost count of the years
into an oven she did crawl
i knew you would find me cause i longed you here
and i am not asking for your opinion
i have an interest in games
you have got me dying for you
up here so high the sky i scrape
i would been staring out the window most of the morning
very deep went down the well
and they turn and they dance
i am a castaway stranded in a desolate land
the moon is out but he is drunk and shouting putting people down
there is no sound no sound
sure ai not happy neither are the kids
you are invisible you have got too many secrets
i know your life is been hard
this is a re-al love story
up here so high the bars they break
you say that it is from above and i say this is modern love
the twentieth century belongs to you and me
daylight breaks and i go to bed
hiding in the dark hiding in the street
i can walk down the street
do not want your bullshit yeah
the rabbit hides beneath the ground
why does she have to defend
i am much too fast to take that test
what is going on what is going on
i got no taste for anything at all
soon we will be making it we will doin' it fine
do not cry no tears around me
finally i have found that i belong here
i would ask you out every night
you ca not know how it feels to be in here
and i ca not see this turning out right
and took them into his house
the road is gone there is just one way to leave here
she rides alone with you and me
from the thorns and the fire
well i am the one who loves
now i am living in this temple
she is losing she is losing she is losing she is losing
your pain is no credential here
on the heads of the innocent children
and as for the tears they will never show
once and for all i am far away
where the naked truth is on the screen
but the oaks ca not help their feelings
but you do not want to stay
i want to feel your purity
of a motion back and forth
catch the spirit catch the spit
we call it master and servant
as he slashes at his prey
and everybody is putting on theirs
all your cutting down to size
i will help you if i can
touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
each precious moment has its special charm
for now does ride in on the curl of the wave
sailing on my every step inching off of the earth
like a spoon that you turn and you turn and you do not unwind
and many times i have cried
i will show you a game where the winner never wins
with the heart and mind united
i am burning inside as the sun
because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
cause i never say die aim never untrue
the spider-child bit him on the ankle
and springtime starts but then it stops
why not come to my pad? it wo not cost you a dime
we could be down and gone
with her screamin' in the rain
waiting for the miracle to come
it is your mistakes i am thinkin' of
anyone can tell we are in love
and the shapes of hooded men who pass me
no there are times when nothing can be done
it moves from arm to arm
i said i would be your lover
keys left hanging in a swinging doorwhy do i
new wonders in the world wonders in the world
there is just something about you
when hatred with his package comes
and laying the nag is carcass in the ground
hard on for love hard on for love
she said all the best is come it could not last
and leave the darker places unexplored
remember my son how they lied
well can you hear me? yeah
and suck my dick because if you do not you are gonna be
i ca not help it i ca not help it
quit waving that thing about! come back!
you could hail me as the new king of it all
only he knows who you are and what you are
while the killers in high places
drop the leash we are young
he is stiffening we are all whistling a man we will soon forget
can lend us a book we can read up alone
people who judge without a measure of mercy
carried through the night into the city
the star of this unearthly show
she screams out jack the ripper
a head full of dreams oh
if you are gonna break down you can break on me
c amon and build me an ark
still ca not figure out the scene i am in
who plays a hero is role
it is a personal threat to you
thought he oughta join his daughter
in the night the stormy night she will close her eyes
she thought she just could not cope
merry christmas we thought we would give you a little insight into our band
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you
i got a feeling that keeps me on my toes oh yeah yeah oh yeah
yeah i surfaced and all of my being was enlightened
go by jacob and split all the cake up
once you start falling you keep on falling
and you might think i am crazy
carmichael was a credit to the force
i ai not been feeling that good too much no more she said i swear
i forget to pray for the angels
i am living there as well
ooh they send you out to war
and there is fifteen feet of pure white snow?
all the days of my life
everything is alright everything is alright
if you can tell me something worth fighting for
i drew a line for you
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
i never heard the world so clear before
i love far better than thee
there is a thousand watts in you
you wonder if your chance will ever come
it does not matter who you are
and be quiet as you are leaving this
but it is not easy when she turns you on
floating high up in the sky
once upon a time there was a toy soldier and he lived in the play room
a bad time nothing could save him
and the love that they swore
on paths where she is leading me
for the beast he cannot bind
the girls are something else on broadway
do you wanna talk about it?
for we are all breathless without you
do anything you say do anything
big guy big eye watching me
never thought you would habit x
call it magic call it true
fall in place along the line
i do not need anyone do not need no mom and dad
spooked by the new shadows that she cast
hooking the steering-wheel closer to his heart
but there ai not no cure
she only uses it 'cause she is a machine
this ai not no book you can close
it is time i was king now -- not just one more pawn
like a rose on its ladder of thorns
one day i feel i am on top of the world
we do not believe in you
you know love is better than a song
maybe as his skies are wide
welcome to the loneliest city in the world
wave to all my friends yeah
leave these ancient places to the angels
then with the fuse in my hand
they tell me you have five husbands
this is no trick of his
exercising her will to lose control
if you will listen to me
with a complete absence of pain
we are all so run down
o lucy can you hear me
please understand i never had a secret chart
put out the light then put out the light
people shufflin' their feet people sleepin' in their shoes
now you have fallen oh my star
is there so much hate for the ones we love?
am i lying to you when i say
and his holiness is proof they said
i am the ghost in your house
the act of love was slowly pounding slowly pounding slowly pounding
forgive me if it goes astray
you are forced you are thrown
what you do is what you are
to rest the devil is legion
what if there was no time
i know you have a little life in you yet
walking tightrope high over moral ground
ya fingers hot and itchin ya cracking ya knuckles
i drove the other ones away
you thought he would be on the level
it is not absurd to all get heard
who made who made up made up the myth
when i walked with sweet sally
the more i understand the ride the more i slide
that nobody else had to die
and hung me out to dry
they gonna inform the police chief lay me low
or should we powder our noses?
all that you been doin' wrong
to know i can trust this
and he curses his virtue like an unclean thing
see the shark with teeth like razors
it is awful hard to find a job
you said hey wish that was me up there
do you love me? do you love me?
who took everything from where it once was
pictures on my chest it was you youoh
it is their ways to detain their ways to disgrace
i see you staring in the fire
but i have met your kind before
and be happy in my company
i am cured and my heart
i see a girl in the night with a baby in her hands
though these wars that you did not stop
for the seas you must swim
i like the clothes that you wear
you treat me like a dog
that we can walk down me and you
and i passed a cow and the cow was brown
is retreating to her favourite place
is another little hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto
friends who fall foul of my files trip and breakneck
future full and empty knocking on my door
my eyes caught the color as it led me down the road
i feel you the joy it brings
it is been a long long long long long long time
oh diddle day oh diddle lie o day
that we pledged in the passionate night
when you walk in a room
now the room is lit red danger
they will never understand the jazz police
setting them to breathe in the sun
wash the salt into the earth
an ageless heart that can never mend
well i can do what you do
that is my message of love
they just take it as part of the deal
but it is too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
i ca not fight for long
babe now you know i would try
that is when i had a chance
he will say i was a malanderer a badlander and a thief
and i hold you in my arms
why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me?
but i think that god is
and he do not like change
of the citizens along for the ride
break on through to the other side
yack yack yack yack yack goes junk-face
i need to know what you have to say to me
do not walk away again do not leave me lost again
and springtime starts but then it stops
how much difference does it make
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
now i got no one to hold
they may die but in us they live on
but we sure get outta hand
they will get me for sure
sweet memories i never thought it would be like this
and dressed me up in a deep sea diver is suit
the only faith you are keepin'
to the end of the last day
shave the harvest from the earth
if i could reach to the sky and touch it for my country
never can say goodbye no no no no no oo
someday you will find what you are looking for
from bitter searching of the heart
all this time we are shuffling and laying out all our cards
all those gangsters with their crimes
i stumble to the graveyard and i
so i want to live in a wooden house
just a lot of things to do
still waiting for the snow to fall
way down yonda' down in the medder
and he who forgetswill be destined to rememberohohoh
if only you would love me say it and tell me so
and i wonder if you want to stay
if you want me to burn away
press my lips against her name
and i love him for that
but he has seen me watching you
unless you are ready 'less you are ready to stand behind it
yes you better knock knock knock on wood hangin' above me
desires and most of all your dreams
i try hard to keep my feelings in
what hidden secrets will you say are in my head
we hold beliefs as a consolation
you know the day destroys the night
this is why the righteous never learn
some will laugh and some just sit and cry
the theatre ceiling is silver star spangled
yeah i thought i would leave this morning
remember that i moved too soon
and i do not have a dime to spare
tonight maybe we are gonna run
i am just an extra piece of dead meat to keep running
when i am with you baby
she said you are strange but do not change and i let her
and one eye on what you do
i radiate more heat than light
did you see them did you see them?
oh yeah i got a feeling yeah oh
sunny days where have you gone?
the way you live the gifts that you give
and so now i break the word
but i am not sure if i want to
you gotta tell your story boy you know the reason why
as we go spinning wildly through the stars
oh i am so tortured 'cause i see all
and if that was not evil enough
juste la ou ca fait mal
he knows where he is taking me
torn by what we have done and ca not undo
between how it is and how it ought to be
but oh when it is flowing
on this trip he is taken for a ride
he took missy mouse upon his knee
it is alright i know where i am going
i have played games with pieces and rules
and call it true call it true love
astronauts in the weightlessness of pixelated space
i have tried so many many many many many many ways
if it were measured in petitions and prayer
the boss says ''bury this lump of crow bait''
ramona put me on these interest drugs
and so inside my little room
the kitten she did gently pass
they made me look at myself
run my winds under her sighs
oh if i knew where it was i would take you there
why such different fortunes and fates?
crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn
i i am i swallow my breath i went deep
if you was a hornet way up in a tree
and you ca not stop me anymore
i could talk to me for years
keep filling that fuel line keep filling that old fuel line
he is standing outside my door
like a soft machine on ice
the love you give to me will free me
and reached for the love i found
and watch her forever through the cracks in the beams
i bend to join our lips but it is too cold
suddenly the view was more intense
is not the right thing to do
before they lay their hands on you
girl it should not be too hard
just be careful when you are walking in the view
bring it on cause i am no victim
turns my whole world a misty blue
where the showman shifts the gears
i have been harboring fleets in this reservoir
and i am feeling like a waltz
they are going to find us
i feel more than i see
to say to me what they have done to you
i try to put it all in do it for you
and you have lost your faith
and i do not really know who sent me
should have been a rock star
we smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
you are everything oh yeah that i have imagined
will you stay in our lovers' story
but too soon the morning has resumed
i need you by my side
and in a way i am spoiling
well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide
open their minds to the idea that you do not own someone
'magine they are busy think i am doing okay
i wondered if he would find me
bring a sea-change to the factory floor
a man lies in his bed in a room with no door
painted room ca not deny there is something wrong
here he comes he is a man of the land
i do not believe in destiny
and told him never ever come back no more
fame fame fame fame fame fame fame fame fame
it is dark now and it is snowing
[to laugh and drag my name on the ground]
if i ever were to lose you
all the words that were said
and let her blossom veils fly
i do not mind if it is raining
if it was a game i could play it
who are carving them up for dinner
they are not the first ones to try
turns the young boy is blood to ice
you may not hear me calling
in fact they have exploded all over the room
he feared her and slapped out sideways into her face
not even the choice of having to choose
but how she was before the tears
trying to it is me get out of the cold water
there is music on clinton street all through the evening
as if searching for the stars
scares me silly but it gets me going
only mad men ever stay 'got no time'
i will be the least of your burdens
but i promise now my judge and jurors
caught a bolt 'a lightnin'cursed the day he let it go
why do you smile the smile you do
wondering what on earth i am doing here
i hide it in my pocket
you do not know it but you are
and we watched the world as it fell past
and the bowery and the slum
to make this man of me
you look for somewhere to start to look
look up i hear the scream of sirens on the wall
a picture of you 'cross the front page
i am the replacement for your part
a word of warning to the weary and wise
uuh baby i am hot just like an oven
i climbed a mountain and i turned around
since you are a shining light
i can see the mountains i see the sky
and she never wears a ring on her finger
that kind of love can only destroy
you will find that doll in a hole out in the alley
there is no one left to blame
on the wrong side of the tracks
the connection was a fragile thing
one day the symptoms fade think i will throw these pills away
but i had to do it drunk
i am nothing in the dark
but you know that i would
baby i am askin' of you
got to pick up the phone
and it might be too late now
i live above the grocers store
the bar is full of holy-joes
it is here the family is broken
i have loved all i have needed to love
my knees are starting getting weak
in the days that used to be
the spell ca not be broken
here is a token of my openness
or skin as thick as thieves'
his blue eyes they were shining
and every spurned heart makes its plan
he is the music of the sacrifice
and it almost kept me warm
i am safe when i am with you
now you are falling to pieces
come with me i will find some rope and i will tie us together
or do something that is never been done
so keep on a-moving in keep on a-tuning in
sounds that build high like a mountain
but we let it run down in our hands
have you heard of diplomatic resolve? yeah
with a teddy-bear clamped between her knees
so how come things move on?
so twisted these vows and so crushed
looking at them just gives me the blues
dance dance dance through' the fire
when i was a boy i thought about the times i would be a man
take heart from earth and weather
shine on until tomorrow let it be
sweet talk is all it is made of
should have hidden it should not you
when i cry and cry and cry
drive back to your old town
but you mean more mean more to me
tell me why is it so
it is a part of you they are so sensitive
all the little animals out of my room
while bing crosby sings white christmas he makes you feel nice
yes i did not hear you then
you get so used to surrender
how could you be so wrong?
today she took a train to the west
so i have seen my weakness
and if no leaves were on the tree
i hope i will see you soon
you go out it turns up again and again
and crack and coke and alcohol
i have got a face not just my race bang bang i have got you babe
i wo not let you go through with it!
i lived alone but i was only
come back and take you home
i had brass knuckles and a bolo knife
hack hack hack hack this heavenly body
the kids always know that gremmie is talk is cheap ride the hula-han over the
it is the mood that i am in
swish swish swish around her legs of lace
sometimes in a dream you appear
calls her neighbor on the phone
through the years we all will be together
so i find out your reasons
day by day the seasons pass
it burns my wall with time
they all try to help me but i ca not see the light
sorrow is child sits by the water
and all those sorries you never said
i will find you food and shelter
now we do not go there anymore
do not it make them wonder?
what you get is another hole to feed
and what if god is dead?
do not even think about stoppin' by do not think of me at all
go firmly to the window drink it in
all i want is to drink maybe with just one other person
to live between a rock and a hard place
anything to get his heart off of the coals
i know you have a lot of strength left
forever i am out here forever
if the dice are hot take a shot
his little hand is on my heart
on a balcony in new york
i need you oh so bad
then i would not have to play the suspect
you are a sky full of stars
do not mention that name and books on love
and i am gone through a crack in the past
but i know what is wrong
ca not relate to the slower things
it is you and me baby against the world
with a head full a head full of dreams
when all your minds were free
old black joe is still pickin' cotton
i hold your head deep in my armsmy fingertips they close your
but then i take such good care of it
i will show you things you have done
i will find my way from wrong what is real?
i am deranged down down down
next i asked several friends of mine
the first time in my life
i loved you when our love was blessed
i am crazy crazy for feeling so blue
when you cut me loose forever
i am left to drift on a dead calm sea
and they slept beneath the stars
you can choose a ready guide
first you have got to last
ooh please do not go through with this
and i always have to say no
i will rip the skin from god is face
like a dream in the night and i am yours
not for just a weekend and a shake down in the shower
yes you better knock knock knock on wood it is no secret
i have a friend in you oh mr clarinet
and my love will never falter
well if i had me one more shot i believe i would blow my natural top
there is no swimming in the heavy water
that must all just sing and say goodbye
urging fidel castro to abandon fields and castles
lord i do not know which way i am going
i am on a roll this time
and i still have these questions
wow! wow! wow! wow! wow! wow! unbelievable!
we will sing without voice without heart and leave no address
skies of gray are not today
i ca not remember it being light
i had to get out of there babe hiding all away
everything is spent and i dig everything
she saw the queen of heaven once
turn around and turn around and turn around
just how quickly things can end
like a steely blade in a silken sheath
but i wish that i had
that like you i should find a way
too late for robert e lee
and i do not think i want to stay
that people from good homes are talking this year
there was a face in the window
it is just seems that upstream i keep rolling
put a peephole in my brain
do not ignore do not ignore me
and you have been coming to me
you are all just pissin' in the wind
i got a right in this crazy world
such as fundamental goodness and the wisdom of the way
do not tell them to grow up and out of it
got me in the rays so guess i better stay
dream a walk in the wilderness
i have tried to find the key
here we are as in olden days
who is holding my childhood to ransom
and your yard dogs are running all over the street
smelling of love through the moist winds
while a billion other dealers are slipping past our guards
blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
that would have blocked their way
do not look do not look down
i do not sit and wait
pilots up and away they fly
it is what i do and what i can
some of us we hide away
you know that i would be a liar
imagination could make a man of you
on the lip late take off
a plea of petition a kind of prayer
keep on riding north and west
who is come to slay the dragon
and you will wake and walk and draw the blind
all my life i had empty pockets
the morning found me miles away
call my name hide my shame
do not be tempted by her favours
and the brown ape in a cage
it is been a strange strange day
there is bread and cheese upon the shelf
send me a card and write 'i think of you'
like the chinese call the country of their birth
had me low and had me down
i flew to cairo find my regiment
i am ready but not willing
no one believed what she heard
time to call in the stage
i do not love you anymore
and as the night begins to fade
help me now i am sinking fast
but my son and my daughter
oh stripped and sold momauctioned forearm
it produced sounds of wailing crying
no words no image no hope and fame
this thing that is happening to me
so i pick out a tune
ooh they point the cannon at you lord
it is the constellation of the heart
du ciel comme un ange la-la-la
got to get a rain check on pain pain
buy the bar out and ride out with the best thing
rain it down until you got nothing left to give
then she flew away into the night
that takes hold of my tongue
says he will spill the whole story
so let nobody put a loophole a loophole in their way
i wonder what it is all about
the watchmaker has time up his sleeve
of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
so i am riding away away
i had a dream of a winter garden
grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
send him on a pleasant cruise hm hm hm
not to touch a hair on your head
can you see ice in my eyes
ah baby i got you bad
when you wo not take it from me
i want to sleep before the end
and she lies in the arms
your ancient wound your scarlet moon
i wo not pray to you
ooh the house looks like a rummage sale yeah
because of you i need to rest
cause you do not give blood then take it back again
i believe in nothing but the pain
all the money you made will never buy back your soul
i was pretty good at taking out the garbage
all is well all is well
whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside
just reach up and touch it
with a flash of silver leaves
this is santa is big scene
the walls in the ceiling are painted in blood
erase that lapsing smile tub lose the slip of the small soap-fellows
this situation which side are you on?
blossoms falling from the cherry trees
the candle burned out long before
[thousand years you will be mine]
wait until we are blessed and all the same
of a woman of the street
the wind it blows the door closed
let is do it one more time
say i am the only one
look at the sky without the smog
set off on a night-sea journey
as the whole world sheds a tear
and a look in the eyes of the hungry
oh they flicker and they float
and i have seen you everytime
like they know just where they are goin'
when i heard that he was gone
steer your way through the fables of creation and the fall
it is not all been saidbeen said and done
there is no one waiting anyway
you dance your dance you dance your chance
it is not there in the buckskin baby
i heard the story long ago
as it lead me down the road
and she run home from school each day
keep filling that fuel line keep filling that old fuel line [repeats]
will the secrets ooze out easily?
and this is where i want to be
you might think i am crazy
sometimes i am right then i can be wrong
but that dream is your enemy!!
deep in the heart of cupid
and young enough not to choose it
it is not easy to slip away
if she can find a reason to forgive
and i would have liked to have known you
give me a reason to die
send your signal 'round the world
and she comes to his hand
i am going but slowly slowly going
you do not hear me come in
was a long and dark december
i see your face in mine
they are just taller children that is all after all
the arrow files when you dream the hours tick away - the cells tick away
i felt a shadow cross my heart
i bleed for you i bleed for i bleed for
now do not try and dig what we all say
we will orbit the moon for just one time
i wish that i could live it all again
i need two charms about me baby to have the whole world
there is a chill wind blowin' in my head
you come home all pushed and pulled
so wo not you take me take me
i do not wanna get personal
and grind my soft cold bones below
i do not claim to know
i feel a little sick and hope my notes are in
in their clothes of many colors
the vows that break the world
down a long dirt road past the parson is place
to the forces of life and love
for she is touched your perfect body with her mind
that some bad baby is givin' me trouble
we went to sleep by dialing 'o'
do not need no good advice do not need no human rights
the fruit of love was in the future
if you could see it then you would understand?
and it is all so much scarier
with his filled-down teeth and a hobnail boot
in his ears the spirit talking
and a changer of the ways he talks
pretty soon now you are gonna get a little older
next month we shall find a place where prices are not so stiff
do not cry you weird little stranger
but i ca not pass this time of day
and i will never sleep alone again
i will stand before the lord of song
when my eyes have been so red
i do not which way i am gonna turn
is this the end we are deserving?
she know is there future is burning
and i want to get i want to be i want to be back to safe home
they hold the sky on the other side of borderlines
no best way to dream [?]
do not let them take control
oh no no no no no!
i kneel down scared and helpless
we scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and
with their addictions and their fast lanes
and buy the whole world clothes
i will wait for an angel but i wo not hold my breath
they are bringing out the dead now
the barkeeper said no and i do not give a good
have you heard how sonny is burning
for sassin' back at the preacher
another flower child goes to seed
hot cash days that you trailed around
it is so hard to stay together
give me strength to move along
well would you turn all this down
just as it was lost to them
let the sun shine burn away my mask
i am afraid that i will leave
and i go to work at nine
take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws
searching the measures in this extra key ah
she walks these hills in a long black veil
eurydice was still asleep in bed
i will grab my back with the rag and mittens
it is okay it is okay x
the wrong word when you cry
do not cry my sweet love
but now my soul eats me alive
well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
and there is nothing to follow
another little baby child is born in the ghetto
i will buy a feather hat
i said i think this rock is grand
and i know if i could have her back again i would never make her sad
and anyway i told the truth
well i dreamed i saw a dust bowl
but i caught the darkness baby
she got perfumed breasts and raven hair
but soon she was down soon he was low
there is something mystical in our genes
i see his snowy white face but i am not afraid
went out riding with the boys
and all the lousy little poets
like my tears just keep on flowin'
getting lost in the folds of your skirt
why do not ya' all fade away
get it down if i am gonna be her baby 'cos baby
but do you love me? yes i love you you are handsome
i met a woman long ago
bind my dreams up in your tangled hair
and the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped
the blood imparted in little sips
you left the sweetest taste in my mouth
everybody is looking for someone to follow
can you hear her little cry?
and radiant beyond your widest measure
when she is on her best behaiviour
now you have met the london boys
there is more than meets the eye
my father was a dresser of hair
thought that we would be last to go
cried 'the stink of human sin
to slay with pen or sword
with your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams
i didoh what i had to do if there was a reason it was you
for he is touched your perfect body with his mind
tides that i tried to swim against
i love the way she walks i love the way she talks
well you can stick  am where the sun do not shine!
i watch the ripples change their size
and the drip and the drip and the drip of the mississippi cryin' and saint
you are a forte of nature dear
we got no time for that stuff here
well she is come been and gone
do not leave me do not leave me
home we struggled hard all our lives to get by
there is a bar hall queen down in charlotte town
and dreams are all we need
you are always saying you are too weak to be strong
like stars we crush and burn
maybe you will be coming back
let me say this to you
nights are warm and the days are young
you do not have to be a big wheel you do not have to be the end
there is a very strange vibration
a thousand people is running feet
we have had blokes like you in the station before
fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
i would rather die than forget you
striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
where is mary? she is taken her along
driven to a fool is paradise
he let me take him in my hands
she could use a little money
come into my sleep oh yeah
you will never know that you had all of me
har in us but power to arm
in my place in my place
lionhearts who have lived their lives like arthur
no one gets to their heaven without a fight
when you feel so tired but you ca not sleep
i feel you your sun it shines
was not it a strange way down?
what did you have to do that for?
lord i ca not go-a-home this-a-way
we are of water in the holy land of water
i have heard all the wild reports they ca not be right
the sky is above our heads
but sound to the ground by creeping ivy coils
well the sun comes along and she lights up the day
and i have got to be me
playing the game but not the way the big boys played
meeting a man from the motor trade
or fuse it in the sun?
he said i am gonna buy this place and see it go
on the day we met oh i went astray
the sportscar slumped snout into a beech
there is no more time for us
to be a threat to the men in power
you are far too busy having babies
have faith in both of us
i see she is seen the long days and night
did i say that i need you?
here again and when you speak
and found you waiting at the door
but my little boat is empty
tell you that you have been a good boy
we are in the backyard some transcendental moment?
comatose but walking stillwhy do i
and his wife was a thief
he gets right on to the friction of the day
we are here waiting for you
ah here she comes blocking the sun
ooh i will come in a hurricane for you
black wind falling to the ocean floor
gonna go fishin' in the afternoon
one more sin make me unforgiven
believed in miracles 'cause i am one
everything you want is a dream away
he is mumbling word behind his red right hand
but stil the days seem the same
i do not know about you i do not know about you
and a brown ape clanking a heavy chain
it is coming from the sorrow in the street
shone the flashlight in her eyes
what does it matter the things you say
now i really have a ball
i wo not be far away
i wish that we were enchanted
i am driving my car down to geneva
that people they just ai not no good
saw some skid marks and followed them around
it is unstoppable in v i p top shelf
did the bop with miss ann
it belonged to someone but not me
so buy me one more drink my brother
but i could not find the words
are not we all the same? in and out of doubt
where my weary feet would be
it is just that i ca not speak
as long as we are together
i sassed back to my mom
oh! do not you pour down rain today
what is the color when black is burned?
all we ever look for another womb
give me one wish and i would be wassailing
i had it all and i risked it
there is no time for hesitating
now it is my time to die
fuck me if i care but i am not leaving here
gun wears his best blue suit now let is take to the sky
hint at more than we can see
let the angels ring the bells
you take the pills too much
but she knows she really loves him
i do not know how you feel
i knew it all without a doubt
so now that you have decided
i got them sit-down ca not fly
the stories of the street are mine the spanish voices laugh
moments of magic will glow in the night
dropped from my black spitfire to my funeral barge
there is nothing up there but rumours
next came the cops all out on the town
tries to forget but he ca not he ca not he ca not he ca not
there is only one god through and through
in his halls he often wondered
you where the whore and the beast of babylon
and rest because he had finally come?
though our troubles seem like mountains
everything has chains absolutely nothing is changed
more than just a finish line
too dark to see the pictures of heaven
i get up at seven yeah
game pie and for him two pints of colder beer
dance with me before their frozen eyes
once inside i am out of my mind out
without my uncle rat is consent
the night had been a giant dribbling and pacing the boards
all experiences lead to a young girl
my friends all tell me i have been a fool
where will the wedding supper be?
the aristocrat choir sings what is the ruckus?
i was in a car crash
and never more think of me
trying to turn against the flow
it was a joyful man she led
been waiting for the night to fall
between the snowman and the rain
soldiers you have got to soldier on
did you see him in the river?
i have been one more hero
something is going on in society
in my bed she cast the blizzard out
toxic waste dumpin' from corporate farms
what i have become they are all mocking me
gonna ride along and fly gonna let it on
no no no no no i will be good for you
then at home on a branch
turn their backs when there is no more
there ai not no cure for love
it is a safe and easy pleasure
ah time we best begin here at the end end
to tell you how to find it
maybe they will let me down
you do not even want to let them start
i ca not play no part
just when i think everything is going great
i will be your one confession
posed to respond in the end
down in the backstreet the skinny get cries
you are happy now but that wo not last
she is dressed in black again
until the turning mind a radar signal
singin' songs for pimps with tailors
it fits in this little bag
stuck his fist up your dress
shipwreck from a love that he calls home
and i have got to get that message home
i never knew soap made you taller
lord this muddy water is taking back my home
or only want to walk with me a while
if you ca not tell a priest
my once so bright my fallen star
and suddenly they drill my heart
reach over race and hold each other is hands
and when our worlds they fall apart
will you hold hands with me under the moonlight?
all of us do time in the gutter
i believe our man is in love
to find out what they had lost
i am riding on the subway
i ca not see what is good
o my friend my only brother
my sweet love my sweet love
i treasure the way we used to laugh and play
dance floor is like the sea
i ca not believe the noise
the wind blows hard from the east
you can lay your burden on me
now we are stopping the world stopping it is spin
like he was giving up the holy game of poker
yeah something has invaded my nights
da da da dumb [repeat: x]
a how i love you till the day i dieah and beyond
and never fails to say get a job
you are part of the human race
i have used hammers made out of wood
in the same game now why would you have to go
between the tunnel and the train
and we would sleep oh so close
is this not the way it seems?
got an itchin' to rock a hate for small talk
than be living in these dog years
or she will make a break
heathcliff it is me your cathy
lying sideways atop crumpled sheets and no covers he decides to
i will never bring you harm
his snowy white arms surround me
take my head and change my mind
we have got mars on the horizon
clearly you do not have to be alone
it is for she that the cherry bleeds
it is coming from the feel
like a flower in the desert
you stumble into this movie house
so much pleasure that it must be sin
and all the while the doctors
and i ca not get over ca not get over you
you wake up lost in an empty town
and the company would passed from the valley into higher ground
while color lights up your face
or nobody will know you are there
wish i could see him this weekend
a hot and windy august afternoon
we are the dead of night
that smile you see upon his face
what can this strange device be?
since you are a shining light
i can see you on a hillwhy do i
hey i oh i am still alive
they crawled out of the woodwork
put their fingers in a dyke
save my soul save my soul
i am ready for it all love
the gutters will run with blood
tryin' to stay up but he knew that he could not
there is a ghost in our home
when an old friend i happened to see
i will be like dwight stone
but i love it when you come over to the house
he took earl is shotgun down from the closet
with you on top and me underneath
but she do not listen to what they say
to the pools that you lift on your wrist
i got my eyes in the [?]  that here in moline
they are quite aware of what they are going through
you better run to the city of refuge
lots of coal in the mines
rest your weary world in their hands
are you getting out are you a big dropped bomb?
he sure to think of me and you
and a girl with chestnut hair
kiss me where i can not speak
is just a matter of degrees
do you want to know know that it does not hurt me?
wo not you try to do us justice
his nemesis is waiting at the gate
i will weep into your eyes
well you think that you are right
the ark of his testament is stowed
i waited half my life for you you know
why i would want to sing like a milli vanilli?
saying ''the nag was dead meat''
for you i was raised up
is slipping out of wet clothes?
all my rivals will see what i have in store
swim to me through the deep blue sea
under an old street light oh near a garbage can
what is this thing i have never seen before?
that could stop this i would stop this
roger that dan i have got a solid tacan
i will be the thing that you feed
that you should see me through
the part of me i shared
they protect you from the voices
but who is to know the power
mother says that she ca not stand the neighbours talking
there is darkness and death in your eyes
my same old same old friend
bent on a windfall rent a sony
is available on a cd called soho
lay your broken laugh at their feet
peering at me trough the gate
oh that which was oncewas once up to me
chasing something new to believe in
does it make you feel afraid?
i think everything is a little off-center babe
or the flesh is too weak
i am coming out to get you
i built my house beside the wood
while my baby walks the streets of baltimore
giving love for the financial gain
i think it is time to board another
i am feeling down everyone i know has been and gone
even when it is not too hot - dig everything
and i am afraid enough for both of us
crazy love must surely have this pain
i learned to fight i learned to love i learned to feel
truth is after all so poorly lit
i have got values but i do not know how or why
it is like russian roulette to you
and any choice i had is gone
and you sit back and watch
and to you i am just
when i turned my back on the devil
ah but you could not take the pace
i like your face in the crowd
some are blessed and some are cursed
armed as they were with machetes
and a voice that stinks of death and vanilla
ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
get you on your feet again
i am just about this far from drowning in my very own tears
put that magic jump on me
and yet they will undermine it all
why was he friends with the children
knowing you wo not get reaction
i just made a simple gesture
and now you want to marry me
wishing they would done a better job at burrying sorrow
i am waitin' for the pardon gonna set me free
and her voice rings in his ears
oh my sacrilege would do you good
it was one that i knew very well
i thought i was an aztec
holding on to live within our embrace
i took the law in my hands
sitting here wishing on a cement floor
grey riders on the morning sky
she leaned herself against a fence
ca not wear my mask your first my last
but the winter fell upon them
you ca not know what it is like to be inside
so that i can i hardly bear it
crow jane crow jane crow jane
so rest your head and read a treasured dream
coulda sworn it was judgment day
the cards were stacked against them
you know that i would be untrue
yes you know that i must die
will you come into my life
ca not do with you or without
there is no one here to leave you behind but me
and i know i cannot leave
suck blood touch please tunnel vision tuck time see
and all the cemeteries in london
so i turned myself to face me
to brown and to yellow they fade
but you and i have been through that and it is not our fate
it is how you see the world
as we would bow as they rode by
oh i am coming to cover the lovers
she beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
and the oaks just shake their heads
a hooked bone rising from my food
do not let them journey all alone
but only 'til you are coming home for christmas
i can understand what you are thinking of
you touch me and my mind goes astray
in the hope that the carny would return to his own kind
do not wanna change my mind
watching you making a fool out of me
and the beat of your own song
i need a compass draw me a map
the path is winding your way?
cough up the bucks cough up the bucks [repeats]
well i know you are a lonely woman
and she ca not stop 'till them shoes come off
o brother be good to me
growing old - old old old old
and there is an odor in the room
i oh i oh i i am feeling drunk and high
it is very touching i am so close to me
nothing is changed but the surrounding bullshit that has grown
have i left my life behind?
maybe they will bring her back to me
talk to me so you can see
when i was a younger man
and this is what fuels me
this love was big enough for the both of us
when you and sleep escape me
i know a place where we can go
when the war began to end
when i get home he is gunna jump for joy
i will not let you in
it is the engine that drives itself
the wreckage of a universe floats past
if all the judges missed the case
and i just switch off and hide
and they are gone like this song
oh a dissident a dissident is here
and dancing in the street oh
so i have been writing just for you
before i know what that means
and your standin' on my foot
see all of us that have come behind
and it seems to me you lived your life
he wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat
you can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets oh
when the sun do not shine it do not shine at all
you and i we must dive below the surface
we do not have that stuff here
slop my drink without that woman at the sink
you never gave good 'phone at all
the selfish they are all standing in line
says i am a fool mess with you
i did not know i had permission to murder and to maim
just floatin' so free and easy in the sky
well i can see what you mean
all of us get lost in the darkness
ohbaby i know i said i said i said i said i said i said
up there in your leather babe
playing on my radio and saying that you had to go
i love her but i ca not [wait]
let me give you loving like nobody can all night alright!
blowing smoke rings in some dive
and to grasp this i do not know
like a shroud like a shroud
life is a diamond you turn into dust
your vampire tooth your little truth
he would show it with pride
it breaks the cage and fear escapes and takes possession
it is the fool on television
i went to the crossroad babe i looked east and west
back in the days living in the summer of love
eyes wide open for the next move
it is written in the scriptures
you raise me up in grace
to the one i will never please
i could not save your soul
but now i need to know why she is with him
by the winds of change and the weeds of sex
why do not you be my girl?
you do not need to run and hide away
singing now my feet wo not touch the ground
you know its never been easy
how i missed her! how i missed her
we do not make a sound
so we struggle and we stagger
come to sparkle the dark up
but i do not think we should suffer this
and i did it my way
now you know i would die
rush - it is the street it is gangsta so heat
if they could spare a few minutes of their time
some of them were losers but the rest of them are winners
there is no point in going on tonight
do we wonder if it is even worth it?
gets me fumbling gets me laughing
love is the key we must turn
live your rebirth and do what you will oh by jingo
and i got down on my knees
and it is hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
underneath the moon in the woods at night
it is a kind of clandestine conspiracy
sailors fighting in the dance hall
and everyone of us is scarred
oh what a thing to have done
for to buy no more whiskey
up against the pink and purple wisteria
you will be there when you know what i know
when you are standing on the crossroads
ask the girl at the bottom of my glass
if you think all is lost
well all things come to pass
yes i am workin' all the time
when all is said and done
you are always out it gets on my nerves
and though i have tried to lay her ghost down
life will surely be the one to tell
wo not you let me flee
i was hiding in a room in my mind
let me be somebody i admire
must be the ones to start
hey joe i heard you shot your baby down
i am in this cold glass cage
you did not raise me there
please do not speak you will only lie
blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
i did not choose i did not pull the trigger
showin' me a hand i knew even the cops could not beat
she took his tavern parliament his cap his cocky dance
and just when i was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in
fontainebleau 'til the break of day
need not be stuck in your mind
then i have seen it before
if it rolls and flows all down her breasts
i was the best i worked them all
it said i am the prophecy
it is getting closer to up-ends
now we can talk in confidence
now he is left with clementine
like a river on your skin
and at first with the charm around him mmh yes
the coldness of the closeness of the moonbeam
so when you fly wo not you - wo not you take me too?
and i am still not really sure
having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web
oklahoma city looks oh so pretty
where are the words to answer you
give a sucker an even break
her bloody prize hear the echoes of the centuries power is not
we stumble and fall uncertain we fall
it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
the sheets are soaked by your tiny fish
i am gonna crawl my way to you
you know this little girl is nearly half of me little liza
things start jumping up from the ground
and the land is banked in frozen snow
or it could be just lust but it will be fun
but i think that you will find
i will never be the same again
nothing more than you can touch now
is it me is it you
something is fallen from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me
i closed the book on us at least a hundred times
closed his eyes and moved his lips
but there is nothing you want to give her
wish i could walk in his shoes
did i have to lose control
look at all the people going after money
when the sweetest voice i ever heard whispered to my soul
drive you crazy really lazy eye rollin' funky strollin' ball playin'
the lord took her away from me
makes no difference what group i am in
you smile and i am lost for a lifetime
it is not a place it is a yearning
'cause my big brother do not want to just let me be
and after she shot the guy
i have used them all before
cold mountain water do not ever swim there
and i screamed 'you and you'
like a teardrop in the ocean
there is just something about you have not we met before?
reaching out for the star that explodes
love like a ghost in my heart
and she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
the room is full of smoke and dialogue i know by heart
do we have to say goodbye to the past?
it is time for us to leave
and should not be gone for very long
oh but wait it is still snowing
or these costly beads around my neck
heard you repeat a what ya heard
how in the world can we live without you
yeah how is about one conversation with nothing else left to be had
run run we have been moving all night rivers to the left
two thousand zero zero party over oops
i have seen these bairns wave their fists at god
and the saints all stand and applaud you
you have got me praying to you
farmer john i am in love with your daughter
show me the place where my head is bend and low
point the figure-head at the glass
hey by thinking we are infallible
i hear her heart beating loud as thunder
youre not gonna leave me alone
they think they live in the age of darkness
the other one resting on your hip
fame fame what you need you have to borrow
god is alive magic is afoot
we made for it break laws rush for it
let it be let it be
under blossom we made pour vows
i hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast
o my love o my love
watch the nightly news and drink a beer
i just ca not get enough
do not say the moment was imagined
passing new friends i wo not know at all
high on the mountain top above the clouds
one by one the officers spoke
till touch down brings me round again to find
who would love to sell her soul
and then our arrows of desire rewrite the speech mmh yes
angels now we will be sharing
that hang heavy with the stuff
and i just do not care what happens next
does seem crazy no good for my health
there is no other way to cut it
at the bottom of the ray
you found me at some party
they will interview my teachers lay me low
we could be like two strings beating
and freedy is got spots zits
she stood in the crowd but she would not a tear
you cannot get out you wanna stay
and he gives off such an evil heat
i do not know why and i do not know how
once there was an inca queen
i never never turned aside he said
when i hear that crazy sound
recognized it by the wedding band
i do not have the stomach to
konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii
but you do not have to play 'cause
and when the broken hearted people
long train of flares under piercing stars
i do not know why i give in but i do every time
if i do not git rye whiskey i will live till i die
i put it into my arm
o jailer you wear a ball-n-chain you cannot see
i will choose a path that is clear
all the signs that i find have been underlined
i am not making a claim
things are going to slide slide in all directions
i am a dirty old man
they leered at you with their baby blues
i will change if i begin to feel
'cause then i wo not be far from home
i found an island in your arms
we were out on a date in my daddy is car
there is my baby lost that is all
and since i fell for that spell
save me from the final day
our policy is firm but fair
we could navigate out position by the stars
get her out get her out
his key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
we do not want to be victims
it was you that stripped my soul
with just my heart and my mind
some things so tragic we have to care
with my bag a-challenging her knickers
a night bird is following you all the time
but that do not make it junk
she was calling her pet snowflake! snowflake!
and there is no sign of rain
and if you stay a while
you grip me with your eyes
how high can i hold my breath and stay underwater
so in the night i stand beneath the backstreet light
and i wish i had their dreams
this house is full of m-m-mistakes
and oooooooohhhh! here we go again
blame it all on chemical intercourse
you are living in the present tense
midnight was the time for the raid
show them the way that you feel x
he would say things like 'i love you'
it is the motor of the western world
you can sleep in the park
yes i was with you o sweet compassion
monday i have friday on my mind
come the hero would be me
and you learn when your heart gets burned
i am thinkin' 'bout my family and what it was for
the television it takes you away
from the desert to the mountain
no we wo not let 'em take control
crossin' the river in a big old boat
light green to green dark green brown
some begged some borrowed some stolen
than any color i can see
a kiss on the wind and we will make the land
you take me there you take me where the kingdom comes
i will leave my love between the stars
and in your head it is worse
then dance just like a casanova
did you ever wonder about the end?
back in the old folky days
give me your heart and i will love you till tuesday
six stars of the northern cross
blowin' some poor bastard right out of the water
now she is giving you a kiss
i am just a pop star jumping away
even the ones with a devil inside
maybe the sun will come out
it is hard to recognize the real thing
when the winter comes to your new home
and you know that she is half crazy but that is why you wanna be there
blessed is death in his name
and she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from china
and you will dance with me in the sunlit pools
the way it is got to be
it is just a question of time
a child can follow the light
do not forget the motor city
babe now you know i would try
hello i am the aircrash bureau
look at me go with my tail on fire
i found god and all his devils inside her
that is too big for her pride
i even go from town to town
dance me through the panic 'til i am gathered safely in
who will spill the story on some long-gone lover
and i ca not stop smiling
do you ever dream of me?
how i survived god only knows
tell you that you look so fine?
it is a this day is sure to relapse
in your head is the answer
i am finding my way back home
i have got to cut the sex connection and slide
ah but why so bitterly turn from the one
a constant buzz of low-level static
no one knows this more than me
on a note full of hope not despair
i understand that i am helping you
you should not fall for all at all
brown skinned indian on the banks
no one no one is here
and the sense of what is right
oh me oh my oh would not you
when the talking turns to noise
you will find love has been wrecked
talk of better days that have yet to come
oh baby your arms and your legs are shattered
jung the foreman prayed at work dom do aaah
i ca not stop these teardrops of mine oh no
is it living or just existence?
i am scared to wake up in case i scream
there is a shadow running through my days
send your heartbeat round the world
i will be marching through the morning
they need your pain to show me
am i just waiting in vain?
but i still see him in the hallway
yes i did i shot her i went and put her in the ground
and try to keep our thoughts away from home
grinning at me from hip to hip
you feel the devil is riding crop
i know what it is like to be
and men to do my bidding
warm breath and all it steals
one day i am gonna write a poem in a letter
threw up at the sight of that
i have tried to avoid it
to get you babe i said i am coming
is driving me to the brink
i never got top dollar but she gave us all a star
i will be your rock of gibraltar
that is a razor in his mit
yeah the cats on the rampart sing merrily
because dreams will break your heart
or i am not even here
i can go anyway way i choose
the pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
there is just something 'bout you
and the cross of holy fire
and i am ashamed of running away
and i am standing over by the bandstand
look at me i am shaking
like a shadow in my diguise
fontainebleau to catch a wave at the fontainebleau
he gave them toffees and played their games
blackout weaves its way through the city
i ca not pretend i am not
party time one more lie everybody is affected
when i heard the band start playing
you know my shadow is made of timber
i am made from the dust of the stars
she once believedin every story he had to tell
well the trees they got much smaller
making arrows out of pointed words
if you do not believe it do not believe
i will have to keep on running
to a place where your heart will not shame you
until my day my day is done
we have a pretty little square
think about the places perhaps where a young man could be
it is a very modern world
run some wire through that rose and wind the swan
been around the world looking for someone like you
and who will write love songs for you
we we are pulled from our path
three old men dancing under the lamplight
for he is helpless before you
i could never go with no one else
so heaven is in my head
past the stocks and over stiles
the nights we spend apart alone
wide eyed and deeper in your gaze
stop all beef snatch off the new piece
night after night in the quiet house
nailed across the doorways of the bedrooms of my dreams
as we sit alone i know someday we must go aw huh
always in search of that land where life seems best
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
i ca not buy it anymore
never thought that i could be affected
this i mean my mind to serve
i searched trough the pictures in a
ca se voit ca se voit ca se voit
your monkey claw your monkey paw
off you go off you go
we could all die any day
once i get out of this town
this was something their stories always omitted
a silhouette in the black light full moon
a splendid mirage in this desolation
i am gonna see my friend make it go away
and if you call me brother now
a weapon that would settle the score
the town is foundations were crumbling
but how could you be taken away
as he does and make his funny little laugh and dance upon your floor
now i am warning you of falling
after all the sin we had
we were not lovers like that and besides it would still be all right
fortune is random fate shoots from the hip
of no one is friend it could be mine
re-arrange thoughts to 'what will be will be'
i feel like i died and went to heaven
and i have notice in your eyes
i catch the scent of ambergris
i do not remember your stories
and i know you have good intentions
for the girl i have in that merry green land
oooh and if you see the woman with the key
asked the lord above have mercy now save poor bob if you please
and a tear broke from my eye
my generationit is my generation baby
i can fly i will scream i will break my arm
we have got five years that is all we have got
but it seemed to me the saddest thing i would ever seen
all the time i find i am living in that evening
and i think that she knew her lines
out of sorrow entire worlds have been built
it is been a while since you did something
we all pray for the end
and the bells the bells are ringing
vilified crucified in the human frame
and she looks so beautiful in her armour
i am so light i hold just one breath and go back to my nest
see the old folks tied in white ropes
you do not hear what i am saying
if you want any more you can sing it yourself
and i have got the need
she is gone like the summer
and it wo not be forgotten
of the sweetness in our lives
let me cry help beside you teacher
my intentions could not have been purer
and hang your sheets to see
and offered you redemption from sin
yeah i am kinda fonda wanda
and while we were running around
it is egg rollin' thick and heavyall the past we carry
they do not seem to notice me no
it could not be done with dogs
and i will leave with you one broken man
so many things i think about
i will walk with my shadow flag
it looks like hell down there
my friend do not listen to the crowd
i will never be laid to rest
that is how you see the world
they gathered from across the land
start again i hear them say
they reflect just what i am learning
going out aloneto the radar zone
the cripple on the corner cried out nickels for your pity
to where there is no hallowed ground
it is like she lost her invitation to the party on earth
let is see if we are that strong
i am on my knees and i am begging
to be written on your wrist
you fall for all the men
this shit is too good to be true my dear
do not oppress an equals given rights
and all my sorrows made their bed beside me
just to see if you can
with an obsessive nature and deep fascination
what are they trying to prove?
a starry highway traced on the map of the sky
jimi is playin' in the back room
and then she will cry just to think that i would really leave her i left her
o you know that i must say goodbye
i bring laughter i bring music
and i say to myself that she should not love anybody else in the world but me
terror in a best laid plan
does not really feel like christmas at all
we could dance the night away
what is missing? he is living a day he will soon forget
i heated up and i grabbed my gun
i have been moved like a pawn
and i think it is gonna be a long long time
it is good to hear you are doing so well
big money got a mighty voice
in most cases sometimes he or she confess why they regret
but now with keener hand and brain
and drink the milk of paradise
it do not make my load much lighter
as the light hits you as you shift along the floor
ah the rose of high romance it opened wide
or will you leave me lying here
to be one in your garden
then direct you into my arms
while you are climbing up slippery hills
in the heart of your son
my brain hurt like a warehouse it had no room to spare
i got a woman at home
we are as blind as each other
so now i am old news
do not fall for a magic wand
no more crowbars to my head yeah
there is a struggle going on
with an army of tanks bursting from your chest
you just count on your old friends
you think you are in control
i would rather hurt than forget you
i read the words that you sent to me
once a big ship had passed
if you do not feel at all
see the guys that used to talk and drink with you
do not say you need me
they say nothing is wrong forever
and i know i like this beat
blue jean look out world you know i have got mine
from those nights in tiananmen square
oh and here comes the man with the stick
i like the beat of your drum
what have you got to say to me?
on the dock of the bay
it is easy if we just walk away
a man could lose his life in a country like this ? sunblind and friendless ?
for now i need your hidden love
if i do the right dance
why do not you take it?
for the turn of your mouth
i am not sure if i heard it
i can learn to get along
i got a bulletin of news
it is long and lean with poison tooth
he said try to go on
and you said yourself a prayer
leaping over the gully where i would one day take lucy
you told me you would stick by me
for the tree of life is growing
i have got to rip it up
sorrow is child wades in deeper
and these children that you spit on
i had a nightmare only yesterday
ca not you see the light
the crooked heart swells all around yeahi miss you all day
the judges said you missed it by a fraction
we stumble and fall we stumble and fall
put my hands up to the sky feeling life
and it cuts me like a knife
he asked will i see heaven in mine?
over all we have done good
i have got an eye in the sky
and some of them fell into hell
joe ai not never going home
that is not what i meant at all
wednesday baby my trial is tested
two new pence to have a go
that we have seen the back
and they are quite convinced they are right
you have got one more game to lose
all the willow winding paths leading up and outward
he is growing up just like me yeah
oh oh oh oh whoa whoa oh
we better stop hey what is that sound
till they get out of hand
for you and me - we hold these truths to be self-evident
but i have got a pin-up
enter number two a movie queen
i thought i would known the fear
they heard just one voice calling
do you know what it means
it is you and me wo not be unhappy
fashions may change heaven knows but you still leave a stain on me
i passed on the solid line
uh-h-h-uh-h-uh - you will make it
big money got a heavy hand
are just ripples in the pool
i would have fallen from the sky til you
still i could not say with precision
turn around and walk the razor is edge
ever since you have been gone
there is something very special indeed
it is more of a duty
blind man running through the light of the night
rolling rolling the ball rolling rolling the ball rolling rolling the
you wo not have to shed a tear for me
oh hideous year we angels have lead
and i thank you for those items that you sent me
did not it hurt you cassiel?
we can scream out our doors
his left hand is under my head
dead man lying by the side of the road
the gospel according to tony day
the years i spend just thinking
that is right is this what you wanted
sometimes we shout but that is no problem
there is a lullaby for suffering
although i must admitstill visits my place
that my life is not mine
she dreams in colour she dreams in red ca not find a better man
va dire a mes amis go tell my friends
significance between the linesthere is no need to hide
this shop is shut for business
but just you wait and see--someone will come to help you
time is a spiral space is a curve
i ai not no fortunate son
you are hung up on time
and up rears the head of fear in me
every night with the lights out where you gone?
i guess that is what i am
there is a bailout coming but it is not for you
jeanny is my babe and that is alright yeah
will cut down the unlucky ones
'cause we keep hurtin' someone who cares
yes it makes you clench your fist
with a love that is true always
you wo not see a sign staring at you from the wall
it is hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation
and i stepped into your arms
so i am hiding away away
i looked for you in everyone
i am gonna get down on my knees
i see your lights going on and off
'cause i just ca not get it right ca not get it right
i forget to sense i am dying
you little wonder little wonder you
nothing is as down or as up
any girl in the world could have easily known me better
and they are going to hear from me
just give me a reason some kind of sign
never seems to be a place for me
it is all that is left of my leg
and a woman is lies makes a life like mine
i ca not believe that god would do this to me
you were my mad little lover
and my time was running wild
i found treasure not where i thought
i found that out once long ago
say after me i am a fool- i am a fool
until i pass this way again
do not ever leave me baby
my father said do not look away
drop him cold now spread the lies
are here for you and me
there must be some kind of way out of here
who did not even know his name
did you know that i do not sleep
praise him till you have forgotten
i am home lost my job and incurably ill
on the bonnet of the van
we will have to find some other place to go and score
bringing to you anything you ask me to
my stockings fall onto the floor desperate for more
do you love me? like i love you?
what is the point of feeling love for you
i have got to get to you first
everybody knows that it is me or you
guys like me are mad for turtle meat
out of my mind every single time
and now it holds our memories
but it just ai not right to take away the light
the ones who pretended to be so strong
'he will find out in a roundabout way'
her bloody prize free the dungeons of the innocent the king
and it is so good to me my baby
ooh i do not stand a chance
by nine he had deciphered the illusion trading magic for fact
if you wake up in the morning light
mostly say hooray for our side
you ca not change the world
and you ca not relate it
i wondered when this would be over
in a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty
if you are my only oneso good you only one
gonna hold up half the sky and say
but when i put the hose down
just then in came a broad called nellie brown
and wished that i could watch her die
they come with their weather hanging 'round them
you shall own a cambric shirt
love seems something like wanting a scar
surgery wo not improve your pain
where time itself was mad and far too strong
show me the place i ca not move this thing alone
i never felt this love from anyone
golden drops of dawn of changes
mars happy nation sit on my karma
on the day they were to die
he said i was a flower of the mountain yes
someone is back in town the chips are down
i know you are going to make make it on your own
and the judges watched us from the other side
will myself to find a home a home within myself
i am coming back to his side to put it right
we will go through this together
like moths on a still yellow light
your only chance is break the state
it is too bad i am not losing sleep
with my guitar in my hand
alice it was plain to see was
seeing my face wherever you go
the age of lust is giving birth and both the parents ask
cause in a sky full of stars
my nurse had been my one salvation
my gaze is caught and held and i
we have got to get it right
they tore you down and plowed you under
in walked luck and you looked in time
but i can tell you this is no lie
or because macky is in town?
and start to dream of somewhere
the boys on a charge but his mother does not know
i hope you wish for me
by the ghost of you and me?
i ca not believe how it hurts
more than just a dotted line
now i greet you from the other side of sorrow and despair with a love so vast
'cause if you stay with us you are gonna be pretty kookie too
fit for one who sits and cries
this is the constellation of the heart
and you you are my only child
dancing to the music so low
oh yeah i have been hoping that
am i the cat that takes the bird
these quiet nights will slowly kill me
as long as you are not dumb enough to actually try it
i said it wo not be long
fading away like an hourglass grain by grain
i am inside and i am trying to get out
slowly it is good and holy
just give me a pain that i am used to
i do not smoke no cigarette i do not drink no alcohol
she went running crying god help me
for love is all we own
now you might think it wise to risk it all
through which the troops have passed
a rush of blood to the head
well if it is so deep you do not think you can speak about it
or was it you you left behind
there is a shadow on the road behind
well do not look do not look down
here is some moonlight to cloak us
every time i try to give that girl a kiss
and they run they run they run him
oh please please think of me 'cause i am i am by your side
from the top of the first page
you could say i am pretentious
all that we need at the start is
hear a man preaching in a language that is completely new yea
and it is part of an all-out worldwide chain reaction
staring in and out storm windows
i walk along beside the garbagemen and i dig everything - dig everything
oh they say two thousand zero zero party over
not of the best of men but ours
i have got my own spirit level for balance
we just looked at the artwork for the christman single and it is preatty damm
on those occasions when everything broke down
he rocks me like a baby
some are born to move the world
will you let the morning come soon
it is written there in blood
token gestures some semblance of intelligence
ooh here is the constellation of the heart
the green ones for living with
you know 'the old friends' line
have i got a little story for you
that he is shaken from his head
i am the king i am the kind
i know that god do not live here in my world
straight down the middle until next thursday
where life leapt up laughing and hit you hear on and hurt you
devils thrive on the drive that is fueled
i will be there once more
a love that will last within your heart
and if you make it death well then rest
what good is a color print
no fight left or so it seems
but for me it is getting hard
run up and around it and jump up real tall
got one eye on the road and one on you
everybody knows you have been discreet
i will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
you just do not get it
and she was taking her time
geez half the money is gone
cleanliness only comes in small doses
listen to me! talk to me! help
let me give you loving like nobody can all night
and see the pain she would feel
maybe you will get what you wanted
i can raise my eyes to
hey baby do not blow away
a con they could not conceal
that even i ca not face
you will receive the signal too
did you ever have a dream or two
and i do not like these drugs that keep you thin
you are feeling a heavy side of your ecstacy
i would just as soon forget
i am an orphan now and i am only passing through
i know it is hard to breathe
we used to say ah hell we are young
a comfort or a promised reward
we might never meet again you and me
imagination could make me love you too
gurgling gratitude for the strange taste
it is all about my girl cough up the bucks cough up the bucks
i was out with a friend of mine
hormones firing like a fifty foot roman yeah
she could spit in the eyes of fools
as long as i remember who is wearing the trousers
that froze me in my blue jeans
we are so much larger than life
fame it is not your brain it is just the flame
i am going crazy with boredom
this boy is made of envy
when i get that feeling i need sexual healing
he let me take him in my hands
i am coming home to wuthering wuthering
i got  more minutes to go
he is less than within us
i ca not pretend a stranger
i kiss the cold white envelope
things to say you just ca not take em with ya
i lose myself in the night
when am i gonna see that pretty face again
and we kissed as though nothing could fall nothing could fall
fly down fly down pretty parrot she cried
deep in the valley of hearts
things they do will all go c-c-coldtalkin' 'bout my generation
mummy come back 'cause it is dark now
i have learned that it is painful comin' down
i know you have heard it is over now and war must surely come
to look at each and every single thing
do not gimme no lip stuck on your cigarette
an air of joie de vivre
i thought i saw the sky bleeding thought i saw the sky bleeding
speaks of good and speaks of evil
whether you will is anybody is guess
wish i was an apple dangling from a tree
and if things are lookin' good
though i think i still love you
i loved you for your beauty
for every reason not to be here i can think of two
you want to throw confetti fingerprints
do sand and shells and stones
even though they know they are only passing through
do you know what she means
but you ca not eat hope
ad lib yeah yeah yeah is
roll baby roll let it roll baby roll
with a penny knife that she held in her hand
listen ah kno it must sound absurd
when i first tried out some hash
all the strengths you might think would
to watch our love shot down
oh lord i get down on my knees
the angels sing to me these words
i am standing by the window where the light is strong
but i am finding it hard
but you have used up all your coupons
for the heart with no companion for the soul without a king for the prima
your legs is hard to resist
like a man listening to life
when i wiped away the jam
oh i will make my way through one more day in hell
i am not talking of the fist time
nowhere shampoo tv combat satellite boyzone
oh i will be sleeping by myself tonight
facing down the future coming fast
for death and you did recklessly collide
and a complete infatuation with the calculation
'cause i would rather stay here
and i do not like the scenery
no i wo not be bored i wo not be there
and i hear mercy sigh and leave the room
i have seen you running from the ladies
with the weather and the wind direction
mean street i would love to see you cry
how can i place you above me?
god give me style and give me grace
we have laid the cables and the wires
i rid myself of worries and my worries were gone
the world was not cruel but kind
that you do not want me there in your life
we are all alone on the stage tonight
yes it is come to this
this is not for you x
bailout coming but it is not for you
do not let me know when you are opening the door
now i come from a family
i ca not reach out and touch you
with the wrong theory for the wrong man
drowning in the deep blue sea
a hand-me-down dress from who knows where
they are willing yeah they are willing to obey
left the porch oh oh oh
looks like you got no friends
who grew to nothing at all'
and i remembered other ones who
but i am kinda fonda wanda
so here is what i am gonna do
and they called me on that too
i got no place to lay on the hay
i can think but i cannot tell
and a murder of crows did circle 'round
let the sun climb oh burn away my mask
it is your face that i will see
nor the captain on the hill
and then they smiled at me
the gospel according to brendan o'lear
i stopped at a church and jostled trough the crowd
i would swim all the oceans blue
that you will be coming home
let me be weak let me sleep and dream of sheep
in a world of cut and thrust
so we keep it under lock and key
my best friend wake up to see you could have it all
i am young enough to remember the future
in the hope that you will forgive her
it is medicine for the mind
she keeps ten men in her garage
another day as drab as today
where you can kick off your boots of clay
for a moment i could see
do not know what to do
a mariachi band begins to play
everybody knows that it is moving fast
at the first taste of trouble went running back to mother
and the young they can lose hope cause they ca not see beyond today
i ache in the places where i used to play
i said if love has these conditions
to this pain in my head
from the east or from the west
so i press 'c' for comfort
i am no better and neither are you
took the dog with him 'cause it ai not too far
and then i realized that 'the rush' brought it in
the best i could and that is enough to say
at the ice-cream in the hand of
he is a signal turning green
betrayin' your mother is need for a shelter
what is the point of trying to raise your voice
she drew the curtain on her face
i followed all the way to the top of the hill
and the lions that they led you to
best left unheard i suppose do not you?
it is a prison of sound
they are taking me down my friend
globes of light float in mid-air
i turn the music up i got my records on
security had a hold on me
yeah they are just standing there
they can fight about their little girl later
it is hard to say the meaning of this song
rush - jump all hot jump off the whole top
johnny is an american uh-uh-uh uh uh uh-uh uh-uh-uh
today is the time for courage babe
we must have done something wrong
appeared to be an animal yet so polite
i am not gonna pick up the phone
the sun machine is coming down and we are gonna have a party
wish you could help megive me a pill
you ca not tell the boys from the girls anymore
bouncing drivin' stylin' creeping pouncing shoutin' screamin'
all around that dull gray world
how did this ever get serious?
and i stood there invisible in the panicking crowds
come on baby let is go downtown
all the drama queens have gone
philadelphia pa baltimore in dc now
i have never been in love before
come back maybe i was wrong
and the stars shower down around you
three hundred and sixty five degrees
to the seat with the clearest view
but they can stone me with stones i do not care
even when the sun is shining
do not pretend you miss me
bringing light to a lifeless screen
i was hiding dear i was hiding all away
they do not do the things i do
the mob moves like demons possessed
i will find i will be a good girl
as it turns into one more
sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a corvette
a dope she roped this salty lie
i am sure it is not impossible to
but i am looking back over my shoulder
find one or more anti-terrorism activist fighting for freedom
like a forest bows to winter
but all the past still yet to come
expect they will either laugh or cry
i will love you miss you all of my life
no time this time to feign reluctance
through it all she heard his call
now the deal has been dirty
i hear you but i do not understand
in my dreams she still upon me
yes oh yes my darling that your bridal bed shall be
well well the landslide will bring it down
baby i dream between the blade and the tongue
a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
do you begin to see that i do not know
oh joe nooooo! it is christmas time joe
and there is nowhere to scream
i may not suit your taste tonight
are you ready for a brand new beat
maybe time is bird in flight
does not mean i did not get what i deserve
white dress torture in discuise pointing flashlight right into my eyes
i take a room with a view
purple words on a gray background
you can scream if you want to
i tried to teach you good rock'n'roll
they are just living in my head oh
with your feet on the ground
wish you told me by and by
days may not be fair always
but you ca not buy me off in this serial world
love seemed to go along with you
where would you learn what you know?
tied me up and put me away
do not look down your nose at me
while i laughed i wondered whether
plain gold ring is got but one thing to say
the greatness of my hate for you
my army of one is gonna call it through
when i leave i do not know
but i am not afraid to tell a lie
and they leave no child behind
dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
and i am standing on my knees
as my life spills into yours changing with the hours
oh a streak o'treacly [not a typo] ink-inks tied my knees all up in elbows
hands off pretty baby tough blood then so soft to slip
where did all the revenue stay
it is not too late it is not too late oh
oh and i believed him just like a fool
i want to be your animal
for many a night i lay awake
i know that you already take as read
where the paint dries like your face
their hands steaming from quick moisture
but fortune has to make that frame
or baton rouge down in louisiana
at the sight and the sound
cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned
all my plans are flushed down the drain
the angry crowd moves toward him with bad intent
in the house where love lies dying
and i am home before the morning
and where do all these highways go now that we are free?
but let is not talk of love or chains and things we ca not untie
until nothing was left nothing left at all
pushing tall weeds right outta his way
i will let the boys come in
oh when i was a kid oh how magic it seemed
and with a little pen-knife held in her hand
no one seemed to hear him
under this pressure under this weight
they will be swinging swaying records playing
o baby i feel the heal of time
i am just a fool a dreamer who forgot to dream of the me and you
and i called for me a handkerchief
the way it feels just feeling you
and i wo not let my heart run away with me
i would rather be flying i would rather be high
good old boys are coming from miles around
i am going to miss you forever
daddy went a walkin' just to feel the earth
oh and when my blue jean is blue
use your arms for squeezing and pleasing 'cause that is the way it has to be
it was not dark enough to shut my eyes
between the birthmark and the stain
and he stares out the kitchen door
people they ai not no good at all
in the day and the night
well i feel so good i do not know what to do
until their eyes come in ??
do you feel what i feel dear?
that do not count for nothing much at all
where is john? they are all out back
i know how you like to kiss
we feel the coming of a new day
i will keep a friend serene
when i feel the powerful visions
there is nothing much to save
they are just living in my head
each comes with its own cost
happiness i know will always find you
can i have some water up?
it is a pleasure for us to wish you together
now the woman by your side is she awake?
reminding me giving me a reason why
i was hidden babe hiding all away
please trip them gently they do not like to fall oh by jingo
he will lose it all every time
such a lot of pain on the earth
we need someone to talk to
it is you my love you who are the stranger
from the demon that was coming from the east
plain gold ring on her finger she wore
i will tell you fellas yea it wo not be long oh yeah
every time you are feelin' fine
with the london boys with the london boys
as the families stand and wave
if the sky is gonna fall down let it fall on me
the land sun trees the sky
i have been in my mind
what would i achieve by that
may it rise up pure and free
from deep within despite the rain
all the woman really wants you can give her something
if he only knew now what he knew then
madmen fed on fear and lies
it was then that i broke down
i do not want you to be someone else for me
cold cold nights under chrome and glass
the sky is blue and so is the sea
and keep room in your heart for two
and when the night is cloudy
the spider web you see me through
i know you can feel it
and then to me she said she will stay
nothing more than you can feel now
but her friend is nowhere to be seen
when i woke up the rain was falling down
where i knew she lay waiting
there is no room for anger we are all very small oh by jingo
i am sick of the secrets
the artist looked at the producer
saying me i have lost my memory
how my lover let me down
but nobody gets a free ride
i sometimes wonder if they know that i am gone
jazz police i feel so blue
then i would be where i am not
'cause i am not much cop at punching other people is dads
then i would have done some things
from dreams to a bowl of dust
i am easy to see through
he is a dodo no no did not hear it from me
i guess i ca not understand
god may look the other way today
and they made you change your name
now i once knew a man
go down go down you knoxville girl
they think he is lost on some horizon
oh do not you see my own heart is blood
he thought he was gonna die
i am gonna go with my ship
ai not got the right to choose barely got the right to vote
money man it is a bitch
holding my hand to my heart
ii to sleep perchance to dream
so you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
high buildings with crippled backs circle around my dreams
and a feeling unknown shook my heart
not taken in i break the circle
and i fight back in my mind
it is no good for you baby
i got to hold on now
look at life it is no piece of cake
the thing that took his place already died
you have got your answers we have only got a sleeping sun
i want to feel you pull away
and was some black face in a lonely place
fly by me on the corner
oh but we will stay friendly like sister and brother
oh dropping down in my parachute
hero - saves a drowning child
talking like you are still insecure
do the bop on the lawn
you ca not believe a word
sounds like they are playing my song
if i ca not have you
oh me i am going home
of glory untold dream where all is god and god is just a word
sweet is the night bright light destroys me
and there is no reason that she would pass
so let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late
to be done with all this twisted of the truth
and red mutant eyes gaze down on hunger city
we do not wanna be man trapped we do not wanna be shrink wrapped
i turn to find you waiting there for me
and move a hand in front of my eyes
i did many things to protect myself
and i ai not no imperialist
we can hit and miss like pride
her aching limbs and downcast face
you better run you better run
in a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed
when i lay upon a mountain
and just when you thought as though
it is christmas time now for you and all the little
but do i have to dance all night?
you dance with pride and you dance with pride
where the girls are like baby-faced boys
heaven we hope is just up the road
everybody knows that you love me baby
i never thought you never never thought you
brand new marc live let is go!
i will love her for all time
i did not have a doubt
ha ha ha ha ha ha
look what i have made cried orpheus
until the other cows go home
i changed by not changing at all
to them and them and others too
remember me to one who lives there
turn it around babe turn it
you and i should get along so awfully
i wanna shake this day before i retire
let is play master and servant
with your bugle and your drum
but we will not count the cost
our separate paths might have turned
if i am bright enough to see you
oh to live and die let it be done
lovers are foolish in the dark
said you will see dragons after three or four
i know i can leave this world behind
until you cry now you must try my greed
he said mr motherfucker you know who i am
the only thing that is real
hope i die before i get oldtalkin' bout my generation
you can see it everywhere you look
crashed and my ears ca not hear a sound
may your sun be happy yellow babe
darling since you have been gone
put your message in a modem
and when i get back on my feet again
when the walls come tumbling in
she stroked a kitten in her lap
the bell from st edmunds informs me of the hour
you chew your fingers and stare at the floor
big money pull a million strings
like i turned off you all
you ca not say no to the beauty and the beast
i would rather be dead or out of my head
i will stay here till billy comes in till time comes
i would be a rubberband girl
brick of grief and stricken morter
and though they speak with eloquence
you will die within these walls
and i have lost the mind that i used to have
all i know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true
you have kept us in the dark for long enough
if you are the only one well i will never be enough yeah
but you needed me to ease the load
all we are ever looking for
i wo not be breaking no rocks oh-oh-oh
all that he needs is home
i can wait until the tide
they said start as you mean to go on
i must admit i have acquired the taste ?
it is never gonna give itself up
we are strangers to each other
pop culture prophets playing in my ears
the sun sets in your eyes
all those people with their faces
on a concrete canvas i will make you a mark
just what a difference you have made in me
a little nervous laughter locking the door
i feel wanted i feel desired
like a drunk in a midnight choir
for my heart it was not open
said the cop on the beat
my angels and my demons at war
there she stands this lovely creature
riding through the range of light to the wounded city
for you and me - we might agree
feel it is a love draw nearer
can they say that you are at peace?
so right now all i can do is give you praise
into the mess that scalpels make
must have been touching close to
we would sing the new leader is song
i have never been so scared of letting you down
and may our conversation never end!
and the farmers all were gone
a cage or the heaviest cross ever made
i refuse i refuse to believe
for all of the things you have done
those who dance begin to dance
but i have gotta let it go
to play with the biggest toys
break his heart break her heart
going do do do going do do do
oh you are really such a pretty one
closin my eyes and actually prayin'
you read me shakespeare on the rolling thames
like a cruel wind clutching my heart
trying to make sense of this my dear
o that is the rhythm of the orchard
well you say you can laugh
enter galactic see me to be you
morning star you are beautiful yellow diamond high
capacity to give him all he needs
but my mind wants to cry out loud
but now we see that life is sad and so is love
it begins with your family but soon it comes around to your soul
d-do not believe a word it is us against the world
take the highway that is the best
but when i hear that crazy sound i do not look down
tonight i have got to get tonight
that way she will never find out
'cause i wo not ask your sympathy
as they move among the crowd
they called me the roving jewel
even though she sleeps upon your satin
ah the beating tickin' like a bomb
i trace the ghosts of your bones
the phone it rang incessantly but nobody was calling
it is a far cry from the world we thought we would inherit
a truant finds homeand i wish to hold on too
talk of walking out on me
now you could say i have got a gift of sorts
i will cop out to the change but a stranger is putting the tease on
it is alright it is alright
do you need his beast for the bone?
all we ever look for our own tomb
when i heard that she was gone
life is such a short thing
as i draw my last breath
i have told myself so many times before
hotel waiters leave the bedrooms of stars
but i have got to get there
and i have been castrated and i have been lobotomized
fused and saw a face before
do not let another day go by
and my big brother come put the blame on me
and the planets gravitate around you
i am heading down to phoenix
the bed is kind of narrow but my arms are open wide
and you know how to dance
once you start hiding you keep on hiding
if you want a driver climb inside
this time i am cleaning up my mind
they dragged jack and his shadow
than choose heaven or hell or me?
to gossip with me and drink tea
i turn my face to the sun
out on the wiley windy moors
i may be late in comin' though
i am a satellite of hate
when they smashed my heart into smithereens
the soldiers soften the war is over
trying to change the mode -- crack the code
and the service drew to a close
it is a disease and they are all green
thought i could run through the night alone
and you have not got a friend
all the visions of the sea
but it wo not change a thing
she keeps saying hate is just some kind of failure of the imagination
this lyre lark is for the birds said orpheus
and as tall as a tree
a shadowy jesus flitted from tree to tree
in the science of the day
send your impulse 'round the world
your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
i feel you your heart it sings
thank you girl thank you girl
i only run when i want to and i sleep like a dog
ah the last time we saw you you looked so much older
cause you and me we were always meant to always meant to be
one thing i can tell you
caught in the spider is web you have spun
i am i am right in front of you i am by your side
do not ever say you are on your way downwhen
when all it ever does is
when i talk in the night
and the sea will rage and the sky will storm
two hundred bucks in an envelope labeled lenore
because that is what they do up there
and on and on from the moment i wake
but he still takes the money anyway
see you lost your trust and you never should have you never should have
i know i said i would meet you
i am a young man at odds with the bible
and he was old and so serene
i am sick to death of seeing things
and i know who is there
oh oh when i if i was a kid oh how magic it seemed
he picks up scraps of information
here comes one and one makes one
this is my food though foul
i have got a desperate plan
do not you ever look in the mirror
oh hand out faces that he sees time again ai not that familiar
when i need a drug in me
we have been running from love
that it shone gold in winter
i will kill all the angels
no i did not miss a plate well
ca not find a better man
where he traces points of view
we went to take an evening walk
and it is another happy day
do not gimme no lip i have lost my taste for it
doo dah doo doo dah dah doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
goddesses of mystery spirits in disguise
here i am on the on the open road
do not ask i am an agent
onto the street below oh tarzie go man go
but she is nobody is baby now
when rainy nights are soft with tears
between the peanuts and the cage
and i check my gunpowder pack
at doing what a woman really wants
change comes slow in the country
to lead the faithful and the blind
when i got home my lovely creature
i am gonna blow it all this time take me one last ride
i have never seen that blue before
but all i want to do is forget
the names can be changed but the place is still the same
but do not forget there is still a woman
for the miracle for the miracle to come
think that it is alright for some
that is the risk that you take
i caught the darkness drinking from your cup
and honey all the movements you are starting to make
when hearts were entertained in june
their corpses giving the vehicle arms
rolling over like a great big cloud
you have got me reaching for you
to live a weak man is day
and do not mention babies at all
ya wake up one morning and you find you are a thug
on a field that is turning brown
oh what good is it to live
words that fly against the wind and waves
so meet me by the bridge meet me by the lane
they live for the things they are afraid of
i can hardly tell the difference
and i discovered that my castles stand
it is something hard to find
and war is not the answer
flesh on flesh but there is heaven in
so much spent today in sorrow
when she saw those city lights
i am searching the haystacks water is sunshine wait for the moment
i am ready for the pain
to the rhythms of the night
yeah i am afraid of americans
but she do not like god
o shadow your a shackle from wich my time is never done
you would not like it here
till the twilight where the sun is gone
are haunting me like my big lies
god knows her movements are killing me
he said i locked you in this body
but they do not seem to care
raise your hands up to the sky
for too erratic to be ok so?
walk through the night thinking we are the world
lord i just need one day
oh take this love take it down
from a shipwreck i heard a call
dance before me like a million eyes
did i need to sell my soul
there is an attic where children are playing
put your eye right up to the glass now
there are no good words for this
you are feeling the boredom too
let is hit the road let is make some miles and spend a little time
i saw you kneeling 'neath a garden
the stars that climb from her bowels
oh what a thing to do
now the damned have no time to make amends
the monkey has a gift that he is sending back to you
oh you fellas better change your ways oh yeah
i was just a tourist in your bed looking
and i am sure i would like your dreams
and i was tumbled up with them
and i bought those one way tickets
i just ca not read shit anymore
we have been blowing up the planet
i am calling you out right now
and all the things that you do
say if i only could oh
will find us and keep us
and i do not care now i do not care what the people say
see them bow their heads to die
they are bringing out the dead now
and the bats are back to bed and the bats are back
he will be down at the end of the car
they are gonna jump and shout lay me low
pure possession of my heart and soul
towards the lights the beacons above the hill
not even a tear for me
as we saw oh this light i swear you emerge blinking into
she needed nothing and no one so
and why is it raining so?
hero - not the champion player
it is pitch black in bed every night:
and i ca not think too much of her
i know saint peter wo not call my name
i have been looking i have been looking
je veux frapper je me retiens
once upon a time i could lose myself
like a drum my heart was beating
or the will is too weak
news tell me make it alright
lifetime give me back my lifetime
or ego telling him which place to park
once you were in my rearviewmirror
she goes downstairs to the kitchen
turns out the world thought me
the bird-girl flapping and squawkening around
with a full moon in my eyes
i will shape your world for you
there he goes with his perfectly holy unkept clothes
i suppose it was the shame
and said missy mouse will you marry me?
it was autumn time and thickly fell the leaves
i am losing track of what is real - i know
the lights go down the red curtains come apart
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
you see it could be even be yours
up in flames up in flames
the captain is fore-arm like buncht-up rope
put out every fire in town
all i have got is someone is face
but there were sorrows to be healed
come and join the brotherhood of man
daddy is grave just went below the line
? not someone pulls me deeper as in cd booklet
now i leave them all in the never never land
now the night is gone a new day is dawning
i started rolling down that lost highway
take no chances on paradise delayed
now in vienna there are ten pretty women
i have seen the doctor he is come to look at me
you got me spinning baby spinning in a trance
i braved their cause to guide
the kids are alright but they do not smell much
oh take this longing from my tongue
she is huge and she is shy
in the peaceful haze of harvest time
just dance me to the dark side of the gym
millions weep a fountain just in case of sunrise
waiting for me in your dress of blue
but if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
maybe he does not love me
but everything was either fished-out or spat out
the arrow on a moving target
who gets burned in a three way script
i will give you one last sin or cure
so he stands up and laughs
well now she ai not more than five foot three little liza
now kiss my ass and leave
he had a different story for every set of eyes
i will be steadfast and true
i am stiff on my legend
freak and brute creation all packed up and on their way
marks are still on my wall
i passed it on and i stood tall
in a subway i called 'you'
he is been takenwhere i do not know?
to the words of a liar
you can stand me up at the gates of hell but i wo not back down
and when i reached my destination
and then i looked up at the sky
and his holiness is proof it is sad
you come back crazier you will feel better
did you confuse the messiah in a mirror
plant some crops and pray for rain maybe raise a little cane
if there is some immortal power
i know even less of you
you are losing her to some crazy kind of motion
she needed nothing and no one here tonight
what you want is so separation
those holy hills that deep ravine
with a whisper everything you know
memories beating at the heart of an african village
damn thing was crazy bam-e-lam x
we are leaving with the big sky
i will always look out for you
aiming at me and aiming at his wife
with just a touch of make-up
bound up and wound up so tight
but when i am cold cold
and it was leap year like now yes
for a time when we can touch
oh i erased it a life wasted
we are only at home when we are on the wing
and i miss you so much
so who is left to play
i will make it all up to thee
down the corner of my street
turn it up set it off
delivered him wings hey look at me now
turn around and say goodbye [x]
and i love you please come home
it was high and fine and free
and continually he is great he is on time
the waiting years were not hard to see
all that time i knew i would
my secret garden is not so secret anymore!
fist on my plate swallowed it down
ideas that you will never find
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
they came to god in secret
and i will yield to the flood of your beauty
that is where i do my prayin'
and i hardly dare to touch
how many times must it be said
looking for a sign of true love
see the boy see the girl
it is you i am talking to
wake to find the scorching light of neighbor jim?
someone is tryin' to find the peoples fuel
i know why i will never be free
cause i am feeling so sad
you might say i am here for you
steer you way through the pain that is far more real than you
even joined in bonds of love
it could sing you to sleep
then you can swim to me
i would love to pull the wires from the wall
who said i would save anyone?
there is a bailout coming but it is not for me
now is the time to fight
but you are not the one
and i swerve out of control
way down yonder in a holler tree
then all i know is i wake up
curtains fall between us in a twisted way
all i want you to know
i do the best that i can
his best friend was the robber
and in the night i have been waiting for
i am hanging onto my pride
i shut the world outside until the lights come on
and all the kids they dance all the kids all night
i bet my life on you
that is right everybody say party
it is enough to send you bats
the owl did hoot the birds they sang
but i see the tip of the iceberg
but i did not have the cash
look how your eyes have changed
he is lost in the forest so wild
you were standing in the middle of an open road
shakes his head he is leatherman
i will keep my head to the floor
no more this talk of they are out to get me
there were hundreds of people living here
and i put the box where love is blind
say it till the cows come home until it gets to you
he is got a road map of jupiter
you were the father of modern medicine
one of the band told me last night
maybe you would better face it
and i wo not look down
and i do not mind if you stay
like you are walking into my arms
well you look just like heaven
then i will be your sister
and he zips up his fly
''we ca not afford to carry dead weight''
they will be da da da da
i am goin' i am goin' i am goin'
you have got a very heavy reputation
'cause i know it ai not me and i hope it is not you
through the back streets of youth
i can show you all the songs
it is over it ai not going
rush - it is the girls the diamonds the blow
and heaven knows that i tried
guide the future by the past
i could be happy the rest of my life
you thought you might be a ghost
baby oh what a long long time
sometimes the need is just too great
i wish i felt secure again
she puts her hand over mine
and he is coming to my house
let is try to make this last
the writing is on the wall
youd like to have my company
now let me be the lover
oh goodnight goodnight my night after night
i am heading mexico way no hangman is about to put a leash around me
and i can hear my mother saying
you get all squeezed up inside
come on now do not you want to know?
there is many that you will see
john lee hooker - vocal acoustic guitar orpheum music
o k so friday is gonna pay
some words when spokenca not be taken back
oh this room is far too small
took a chance but how could they know love?
he is alive but feels absolutely nothing
because you have to make this life livable
there  will be the saving grace
with the book in my hand
under the bridge and into your dreams he soars
but they think that we are holding a secretive ball
do not you bring back the reveries
well let me put it to you nice
every girl know about the punctual blues
i am not asking for a miracle
i do not know why i am unsure
with the secrets of the worlds
and drive around a faster car
two million miles across the land
needs all the comfort he can find
and i would make you feel so good
and he is always practicing his cowabunga call cowabunga
he heard you could see your future
just be for real wo not you baby
so up they picked me by the big toe
a highway out of yesterday that tomorrow will bring
i do not want to be born again
and the mercy seat is smoking
you do not need a lawyer
wake to aching cold and a deep sahara of snow ?
if you want a father for your child
towns are hurled from a to b
each minute spent with you is the right time
yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control
bad judge saturday another life line
all i know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
but you do not want to lie not to the young
i got  more minutes to go
i will be waiting oh no matter what you say
i shit and i stink i am real join the club
i will paint you mornings of gold
we ca not sooth pain with sympathy
but i i will get up and i will run
that you were meant to keep
so long as you are with the london boys
i turned to the woman and the woman was young
a scheme is not a vision
oh well that is too bad
moved to worship we bow and close our eyes
for the days of fater were strong for you
she comes dancing through the darkness
now i am fighting to breathe
the same thing that makes you live
tripping on the water like a laughing girl
and not much to make sense of
it is the only return that you expect
do you still need the moon?
ca not see the wave you are riding on
it is a breath of fresh air
you look at me and you reach for the free blue sky
but i am there for you
never felt this love from anyone
and i dragged her 'round and 'round
it is a very special knowledge that you have got my friend
sat here with ourselves in between us
they say start as you mean to go on
and he is doing what is
i do not need to listen to strangers
well the morning light shows water in the valley
all that noise and all that sound
our mem'ries remind us maybe road life is not so bad
you know we will find you
bare strip takeoff skimming over rhino
that gleam in the distance could be heaven is gate
you are smiling at the seaweed
you can go out you can take a ride
i come down from the misty mountain
i have begun to ask for you
the mind is grey like the city packing in and overgrown
you know that you are ly'n'
holding my fist to my racing heart
he is got a star map of hollywood
if you think that all is lost
i will leave with your permission - check it
from the lowest low to the highest high
but i am gonna shake this day
giving all the positive virtues that i possess
you could say it is already been done before
but still neither force would yield
yes it echoes through the crowds
the dancer slows her frantic pace
i get the feeling i am no-one
i saw you come out of a scene
and now he is home and we are laughing like we always did
i will be back for more
for a second i was in control
your shining prize your tiny cries
i do not care which shadow gets me
i got  more minutes to go
and it is hell to pay when the fiddler stops
yes i crawl back into your open arms
tried to walk found a severed hand
just to see if she was real
o tell me why? why? why?
so i run into the hall
the holy books are open wide
now john finn is wife was something of a mystery
the more you put me back in line the more i tried
you knew you were in this song
and do not love me quite so fiercely now
and for something like a second
and my girl never fails to see if there is any work for me
they could give us a war
they are moving us to mars
there is a sailor who drinks
and the home of the hip
things i know -- things i wonder
shacking up is all you wanna do
i talk a lot a sign of fear
i do not know what it is
now catch a greyhound bus for home
i knelt there like one who believes
deeper here lies hidden answers and treasures for him
let my love open your door x
you better run you better run
so afraid that he might show
wrapping up dope in a paper bag
so no-one noticed that i have come undone
he was pounding on my windows
i ai not no cia son no
there is gas in your barrel and i am flooded with doom
my back is broken my feet are hurtin'
you would better not mess with major tom
findin' it in the mornin' light
all nations will self-destruct according to research scientists
the whole world will be relieving
she leaped out of her seat and screamed someone is not concentrating here
as deep as ink and black black as the deepest sea
you say it is nothing personal
and that is what made me see
hey look! there is a fiver
till you hit the cold cold ground
tell me this whole thing is madness
my do not was saying do
i got my right side fighting while
he knows of horrors worse than your hell
to the heart of cygnus fearsome force
from the brave the bold the battered
i was talkin' to the preacher said god was on my side
mack the knife wears fancy gloves
hey little train! wait for me!
i am saying i need it now
love her love her love her love her
a bad moon is a comin'
lies jumped the queue to be first in line
and she is stinking of drink
and her tongue burst through her throat
the night is black without a moon
but she wo not say anything
and we are standing side by side
for in my life she plays the starring part
he is only flesh and blood
men will come and rope the sail
i oh i oh i lalala lalalala
o lucy can you hear me?
but they heard my story further
he gasped and said o my god
et ma patrie helas! and my native land alas!
i put my hand over hers
he played it through the night
the thinker sits alone growing older
a looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
dropping in on you my friend
standin' at the crossroads risin' sun goin' down
any way that i can help?
and i am the happiest slave alive round here
waiting for the winds of change
the old boats go gliding by
to feel how the fire will feel
yes one hand on my suicide one hand on the rose
you near him on the motorway
yeah this little girl turn me upside down little liza
not one man is voice can sound
saying i gotta go i gotta go the bomb and the bread basket
that i ca not get unwound
the aromatic finger drawn up to his nostril
and he calls to his mother
just like its climbed right out
sometimes the damage is too great
the love that you once knew
see the hackles on the cat
is as black as his soul
wild as any freedom loving racist
i will go with the wind
do not want to see another generation drop
listen to what she is trying to tell you
and her shoes were number nine
all the things i could say
who kneels there as deeply as thee
no wonder he gets thinner what with his cold'n iskinny dinners!
well you can stake that claim
holy low on money their intentions are tall
full of pain its sharp just like a knife
do your dances alone in your room
in a willingness to risk defeat
roads stretch out like healthy veins
you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
three rubberbands wo not keep you up
and he could not hide a grin
i have got a pantheon of animals in a pagan soul
i would sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day
just when you think you have caught her
he is using code that only you and i know
someone to fool us someone like you
sometimes i call out for you and sometimes i am afraid
with a garland of freshly cut tears?
approach her you wretch if you dare
it is true we have been chosen
when you glinted in every eye the held-high
and i do not know right from wrong
it will change you in the middle of the day
i will tell you when you are going down
then i will pop him one he wo not see
love ai not lookin' for perfection
there is some truth in it
they are gonna throw away the key
thousand years and i will return
and i sing this for the captain whose ship has not been built for the mother
i like to feel the wheel
and it ran away with me
she told me of the famous sons
they ca not touch you no
next morning on the way into town
but that is just a tease
they tell me heaven just has to be somewhere
so do not let me sleep
you can hear it in the valley
and a cold and bitter wind
telling you loud but selling it small
a low tune whistles across his grave
minutes of a game we won so long ago
i intrude on all such things
i will track him 'til he drops
when it started we had high hopes
i feel you within my mind
you will be followed another day
cause i have been waiting for days days days
i put on my pointed hat
'til the stars go spinning - spinning 'round the night
the way you love me is frightening
my will is crashing synapses flashing slow
and all your armour has turned to lace
i will pay you back one cold day
crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
that burns in desire is name
and your heart that is banging and beating
i ca not read shit anymore
while half gets on with it anyway
it could not be done without dogs
we are dreams in cold storage
i have seen the coat for me
she dearly needs to to say
the one they will say that shook
it is getting stronger and stronger
i did what i had to do if there was a reason it was you
i feel the heat it is time for us to start
i can take this or leave it
who will put their arms around me
plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto
i got the vision of a big white dove
you are gonna make me feel so cold
oh ca not expect to go out to go out
her legs wrapped round your head
'cause i ca not stop crying
love is blind if you are gentle
to what i felt back then
steer your way o my heart though i have no right to ask
ca not you see where memories are kept bright?
you said where have you been for a hundred years?
allow me my love to allay your fear
that we may know the truth
are you gonna scream 'oh no'?
there was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
do you fall like tears on an ocean?
you can move up a little closer
i see my times and who i have been i only live now and i do not know why
they have got the stars for the gallant hearts
when you love someone but it goes to waste
must rise and save us from ourselves
i will help you pack your things
i just need one day somewhere far away
gone his worries his hopeless maze
o sure i would like to marry you
it is just everything i do
now you see them now you do not
i do not understand those songs you love
jed took it up and read it
in wave lets me stay calm
and the smoke began to clear
if you are gonna go go now
but you lost them in your freedom
who knows how it could be
all of the surface and the underneath
see it happen and the message it sends
