but they have greased the road
i was always one for loving and leaving
i say trust him at once which is something these days
he was a friend of mine
from the sirens night and day
or if you are stuck in square one
getting lost in that hopeless little screen
this will be our last goodbye
put your pain in a box
i will cry for a while
the cars full of spectators pass
i could feel what he was feeling
of all the things i should have said
and when i kiss his ice-cream lips
there is something beating here inside my body
i love the way she wiggles she wiggles she walks
and then he whispered would i mmh yes
we bed in a bucket of butcher is knives
but we could be safer just for one day
i take a walk so i can curse my ass for being dumb
you see i i do not want to be hurt by love again
is this love big enough to watch over me
i figure i will be damned all alone like i began
there is trouble in the forest
when i said that we were through
altered by a fallen eagle a warning sign
and a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
what am i supposed to do about it?
take it in right to your love life baby
oh it makes a long time man feel bad
i tell you baby do not want no home
it is the second half of the cruise
have you lived a lifetime today
i love i love i love i love jazz
and i am looking to the day
i do not know if you love me or not
you can take me for a little while
i have been running through these promises to you
how near you sleep to me
and here comes sunday is slave
i do not understand these boundaries
fame fame what you get is no tomorrow
from now on our troubles will be out of sight
pour on a symphony now i just ca not get enough
i have always heard that crazy sound
we have seen a million stones lying by the water
takes the train from paddington to oxford circus
i told you babe once before
do not you see this is
tomorrow see the things that never come
they are both just the same
i rolled and thrashed the whole night through
here on the floor with these very loose young girls
in the blue you whisper into the music
thought i saw the virgin look at me and cry
we feel the push and pull
why do not they call a truce
i wish that things were better
rye whiskey rye whiskey i never could fly
keep on looking forward no use in looking 'round
look just like mountains through the snow
his crooked mouth is full of dead leaves
make those cuffs and collars gleam
they do not tear your sleep apart
my counterpart - my foolish heart
you must learn to serve me well
got so crowded i ca not make room
what am i supposed to do?
i ai not no millionaires son no
ow did i come to be here anyway?
to show you how it all began
and out expanding in a faith but not in love
on this side of heaven again
i took a trip on a gemini spacecraft
i need to hear that you love me
that i have spent a lot of time in education
it is a world of superstition
if you love someone tell 'em
and there will be hell to pay
when you are here can i do no wrong?
i wo not say it again
i really do not understand the situation
stop at the supermarket people stare like i am a dog
sometimes i feel the chance is surprising
do not argue now you will be late
an old grey barn still stands
i forget all about what hurts
if your mindless please take mine
hero - the pride of purpose
to be to be with you
i know you get dizzy but try not to lose your nerve
i have nothing to lose nothing to gain
when you left the door was
all of my stolen missing parts
yes i will walk with you a while
and he might lift me up to the stars
and she will take off time just to give me a call
i would given my nurse the weekend off
i said look you do not know me now but very soon you will
i fell for so long for you
now i know it is gone
i am not looking for an easy ride
i am out on the interstate
when i leave this world behind
bite your fingers to the bone
oh i oh i oh i i am feeling drunk and high
there are no corners to hide in my room
but now it is much too late
be with you baby oh alright
the good son walks into the field
but you sent me down below
down to brother can you spare
i know you have a lot of strength left
i have made myself at home -dig everything
because they say it is sacred ground?
ah baby let is get married
i am a prisoner here yeah but i am also free
but god is nowhere to be found conveniently
let your fingers walk and talk
last night your shadow scampered up the wall it flied
this picture i am so nervous
and i know you sent me some
all that i would say to you
for the worst it has come true
and i thought you were crazy wishing such a thing
i thought i saw angels falling
if it is just inadvertent imitation a pattern in all mankind
but he could not help me either
i will burn all your books and the problems they make
and we would see the new sun rising
with the blue quilted violets across the breast
these are things that i do not understand
never lose heart all things will pass
how did the clowns ever get control?
another dodo no no did not hear it from me
stop here for a while until the world
and i am not asking for your opinion
preserve my room but do not shed a tear
to be done with all this looks of disbelief
a hundred thieves cast a spell
look this cup of mine is empty!
my head is shaved my head is wired
she said the prettiest place on earth was
as you go down to your goal
skeletons entwined fucking and braying? fields
and of all the guardian angels
an eskimo showed me a movie he would recently taken of you
through the woods and frosted moors
i want to feel your pink clean skin
while i run away with you
heyi did what i had to dooh and if there was a reason
vibes in the sky invite you to dine
it is so hard to just walk away
did you guess that we have been done wrong?
for though they may be parted there is
she is out on her own and line high
just when all the bills are due
but the soldiers look so brave
my heart ca not thrive on misery
way across some cold neurotic sea
you will be right here by my side
trying to save the day for the old world man
jazz police are paid by j paul getty
and the summer night is fragrant
when you feel the ribbons eye
it is a very happy day
talk to me my long lost friend
it is all we have got is not that enough?
man of peace or man of war
love do not care if you are wrong or right
to a tiny church in liege
scrutinizin every lil piece of dirt
everybody knows that the dice are loaded
all you ever wanted to be
he will drink to the health
shut down the block pay off corrupt cop
and that law it is love
a throne from which i am told
there is a war between the ones who say there is a war
and do not you want to see it come soon
but i have not been to oxford town
we are all the same whatever we do
i have got something for you
they shout about love but when push comes to shove
oh but it is been such a long long time
and with thei will become one
well i have been afraid of changing
you do not want to hurt me
the six strings that drew blood
some would said they never fear a thing
my priests they will put flowers there
tell the people that you saw me passing through
the way the big wheel spins
when the cities are on fire
she was the only one that we all could dip and dong
hush my baby do not you cry
here is a page from the emptiest stage
will now mean you and here
i always said my girl is a good luck charm
i long to turn my path homeward
but why let the sad song play?
but his heart do not seem to know
oh love do not let me go
so my mouth waters to be a fate
so much mind on the matter
deep in the night it is all so clear
but i am so busy with this fix of mine
the wisdom that the old ca not give away
i met a man from new york city
or is it in my head
sounds familiar it may be worth a second look
with my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
when he reached the shore of his clip-on world
you know the legends never wanted to be me
counting on one another to survive
sometimes things do not work out the way you planned
pain and misery always hit the spot
the birds they sang at break of day
when i bit off more than i could chew
i know in my heart that i will have to change
just take a look at your body now
then i want the real thing not tokens
every night there the headlights are glowing
like that sailor leaves come back again
for you i would wait 'til kingdom come
the uh tracking data map data and pre-planned
that you are gone and we are alone
i will got him and i will not miss
if living is my cross so let me die or crucify me now
it knocked me to the ground
i would like to get to know
made me want you to stay
that you are finished with me
i knew i was getting hotter
had the same dream in the very same scene
i learned to fight i learned to love i learned to steal
feels like i am fighting the possession of my soul
i would like a quiet town
that i would have to find a way
but they did not even try
saint huck goes on a dog is-leg now
nothing in the mirror - check it
my father is in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized
do you see the way that tree bends? does it inspire?
red man is your neighbor call it behavior
and spend my evenings with it
i take your interest back ca not let you roam inside my head
lily oh lily i am so afraid
my old dad went a walkin' one day
excuse me i am sorry to bother you but do not i know you?
your name is being called by sacred things
the smell of it is heavy it is charged with life
i will have a right to shout you down
and nothing is safe that do not stand still
remember it is true loyalty is valuable
they set you on a treadmill
she turned to face the setting sun
i had to pay some bills
when i tell you i cannot love
you do not need to surrender
the trees had burned down to the ground
yea and we slit the catholic throat
a man had his own way
and on her he made his bets
do not ever think that you ca not change the past and the future
held on if i held on
but then maybe that is fatal
gotta roll roll roll gotta feel my soul
big man stands behind an open door
when i am driving my rig
maybe you will know when you see it
and there is just one word that i still believe and it is
it is not a matter of laws
so hard to make stand still
was not it a wonderful site
no short haired yellow bellied son of george-porgy is
in her home i would dwell
hide your trinkets hide your treasures
i have got to break the word
when the water takes us home
or turn away turn away turn away
a chin of stone a heart of clay
do not call me daughter not fit to be
and it is fitting he is barely living a day he will soon forget
and so shattered it will reach you everywhere
while the cleaning ladies sob into their mops
can kill you in the end
judy he is the stone that broke my heart
i find the key but i return to find an open door
all these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us?
and then leaning on your window sill
ca not escape from the common rule
no concentration means 'fail' these days
sayin 'smoking and drinking will be thy downfall'
but if i think like you think
and i will wave my flag for you
i still ca not remember when
i have pulled down my lace and the chintz
oh he fills it up with the love of a girl
i pulled the covers over him shoulda' pulled the alarm
like an angel fly over your house
to the depths of the deepest sea
oh oh the next time we touch
ai not it the truth now
dust of the years and picked it up holding it reverently in
though the heart be still as loving
i have never seen your eyes so wide
i see an old man knocked to the ground
so hard to laugh as i fumbled
i have no welcome in my house
but for their lack of imagination
garbage in honey garbage in honey
she ai not coming back no more
a million candles burning for the help that never came
of rags and silks a costume
you could meet me if i send you down the fare
johnny wants to suck on a coke
what is this? an infant kiss
some fought themselves some fought each other
jed you really screwed up now!
please do not you want me do not go on me
i do not know the question
saying dear son what have you done
to live for where it is hid inside
i am going to take my time
put me up on the angel is shoulders
and i am moving in i am moving in
but i do not like this
and i will stand on your grave till i am sure that you are dead
no the words you sang were wrong
i stand still stepping on the shady streets
all man and beast will mourn
somebody ran away saying fast as i can
or be broken down blow by blow
you hear your sister calling for you
when we started on traditional roles
and wanders out into the street
so please do not kill the machine
your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
i am not going down on my knees
i can hear your soul crying
said the captain of the shore
i have seen too many tears
do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?
through the fields of early may
but pretty soon it wears me out
keeping your boots on float with the now hot to the touch
holding on live within our own ways
but how pretty the picture was back then
get well get well love henry  she cried
they are turning my head out
dance magic dance ooh ooh ooh
take all worries out of your mind
i am all by myself i do not need anybody else
so sue me if i go  fast
learning that we are only immortal
i am his rod and his staff
and i sit and i drink of my opium tea
and said drink from me drink from me
with a picture of carmichael on the front page
brother for i am your sister
like my sister used to tell
scenes of my young years were warm in my mind
all the great cars of the world in one massive collision
well i am right with you
anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
'and i am still looking for the rhythm'
but i will do it all the same
they were not born in lotus-land
let my love open the door x
bodily whole but my head is in a mess
it is long and lean it is got a poison tooth
she we never thought of ourselves
you better pray tender pray baby tender prey
i have deciphered tricks at the bar
what if she came to me
and i ca not wait till i get back
and i am not living this life without you i am selfist and clear
young girl violence center of her own attention
we takin dough right from off of your books
here is an ode ah to deodorant
you better run you better run and run and run
but it is on the table
every maid he came upon he thought it was his dear
from the young man in the nd row
did she want me to change
and i am full of wonder
sometimes i wake up in the morning
even though i am sure it is not
take away the love and the anger
the pride of the captain is eye
and i say to myself that i need her
i am guided by the beauty of our weapons
when life and love turns strange
about the world we live in
but i know you will remember that day
we go down to the river where the willows weep
my case is easy to see
blue jean she got a camouflaged face and no money
shot down in the line of duty
hey there you lady in tears
i will still be grey my way
it is one for all all for one
now i am going to miss you i know
in his young and restless heart
we are the goon squad and we are coming to town
what is it mean to us now? yeah
between the windmill and the grain
i picked a stick up off the ground
while others only see the worst
there is a fear they will soon be parting ways
you are so fresh and you are so new
there ai not no drink no drug
this is my bunk with two sheets
my mind is in a state of confusion
like a swollen neck vein branching
but your mercy and grace brought me to this place
as i swim in and out of focus
funny how i always want to give in
in the wake of the endless flood
i live but i love this life
oh--and he is ready  roar party
and your mouth was covered in foam
i would just like to hold her hair
we are spending the treasure oh no no
with a terrible wound in his side
speaking as a child of the nineties
the shouts of joy skiing fast through the woods
so entwined now that we ca not shake free
show me the place help me roll away the stone
her eyes are open but no-one is home
leave it all behind nothing will be found
when i get home i am gunna straighten it out
and i have seen my days
we loved the easy and the smart
when you are new there is a lot of distrust
and he leaves a baby sleeping
maybe we could talk about it
you do not get freedom for free
watch it grow before your eyes
once upon a time i could control myself
and the feeling it gets left behind
standing cold and old i am insane
yea i am still so afraid on my own
so i will try to save them all
off of howth head and into the flesh mmh yes
it is not your waynot your way
to beat and burn and kill
here we come out of the cradle
on the edge of sleep i awoke to a sun so bright
i wanted to be your superman but i turned out such a
walking down the street brushing arms
we are young we can break
we talked with tall venusians passing through
i will suck your mind dry
it do not row row row
then all my troubles will be gone
do not you think she sounds just like me?
shaking their sex and their bones
this must be someone else is story
prayin' now to something that has never showed him anything
i thought of time and distance
seen fellas running around with someone new oh yeah
a sea of honey a sky of honey
when you are still waiting for the snow to fall
more men fall in hullabaloo men
but at the end of it all
i lick my lips to start the first line -
it is not as if this barricade
they fall among the voices and the wine
through bitter wind and stormy skies
just embrace what you have known from the start
i would gladly go with you
we mostly fall we mostly run
but i do not care what the people say
your face comes to me from the depths dear
you are not a home for the hearts of your brothers
like an old film with sound
i do not case if you are going nowhere
i do not know if i will get up
here is an ode an ode to aerosol
think it is cool to kill
my boss says no dice son
your private life will suddenly explode
who is the man we all need?
seven forms eight forms nine forms
i buy what i am told:
oh willy dear do not kill me yet
she asked if i had seen her johnny
and lay your head upon my shoulder
so many i have not seen
or we will blow you out of here
vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes
i know that nothing can stop me
i can dance dance dance all day all night
and he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
but the street is still the very same
your words and the kindness that set me free
i took her by her golden curls
i wo not give up yeah
were as distant to you as the moon
i want to know the world
i strip away the old debris
god but you are beautiful are not you?
you ca not be too careful
god was a major player in heaven
i am too old i am too thin so?
and throw him in this deep deep well
and no doubt everything will go as planned
you took my love then died that day
i will be the lily of the valley for you
look down into the face of god
of all the things we should have said
when you are in my arms
and we both know why we have come along
do not be-e afraid of this
once fastened servile now your getting sharp
now it begins now that you are gone
do not break your back if you ever see this
your bony fingers scratching on my wall
now my name is on the line
lines of worry appeared with age
how i like you miss shy
said the man with the fire firing the furnace
free-yea' and you can know it all
i just cough and catch the chase
he took out his tuning box to play his love a tune
who who who died and made you material girl?
to drop a bomb on the wasteland here
but if you are gonna dine with them cannibals
too much for one lens to see
but do not sell me there ca not be better ways
would kill a little bird like me
those stars make towers on vowels
love reign o'er me rain on me
and i am not gonna say i do not mean that
from the north down to the south
making more friends would be easy
it is something something out there here
i will step into the ring for you
the children of the summer is end
now he is sitting in his hole
but just saying it could even make it happen
why would you have to make us so uptight?
all the hurt you thought was gone
for a plane full of boys
you will get up and sleep
and i got my children too
ooh i think she can live with me
for you and me - sex is not a job description
it is raining on my house and none of the others
now you are getting to me
seen the tears in my eyes
too much thought it is overwrought a hole
and a sickly voice calling me handsome
where do we go nobody knows?
and quiet is the thought of you
todd browning is freak you was
that people from bad homes do again and again
that you made in the barn
in these frozen and silent nights
did you know you are talking to the heart
i do not worry about it at all
and twenty deep holes to bury them in
well i see jane is awake
you smiled at me like i was young
you are death and living reconciled
but he never had a proper education
do not put your foot on the heartbrake
and i heard a voice that cries it is all in vain
on a cold and grey chicago morn
how is this life that sweet when i am crying in the car
as the bomb sailed through the air
at least that is what i feel
the moment can be so real
a judgement made can never bend
come on get it on right into the sun
old saint nicholas up the chimney
light my candle from the sun
whistling tunes we piss on the goons in the jungle
and you want to travel with her
as midnight nears and shadows creep
i do not think it meant anything to you
you will begoing out with radio
taking the word to boys and girls
they climb the hill out of it is belly
i ca not forget the things we used to do
when i am in your arms
cutting tangels out of your hair
but we will have a hot time on the town tonight
forced to endure what i could not forgive
it is time to face the consequence
i been talkin' to my alter
but only love can break her fall
i know your trail of tears your slip of hand
i do not run around with no mob
remember i was just like you
there is a thousand points of light for the colored man
i would not i would not even try
a blackened shroud a hand-me-down gown
it has three-eyed fish and it is smelling strong
they are only little tears darling let them spill
would be sure to do their worst
he is noble enough to win the world
whose symbols are the millions slain
baby you can bet that it is true
quiet rebellion leads to open war
while i borrow seeds of sadness
on anxious boys and frightened girls like you
i have been everything i need
is it all just human disguise?
i have been waiting for you
your lips move but i ca not hear what you are saying
even how you laughed at me
like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea
waving its arm as the wind blows by
and stitch and stitch and stitch
you will tear up your feelings but the memory is quite safe
it replays each of the days
who by high ordeal who by common trial
recorded music sticks in the throat of god
and he stood so tall above me
declaring declaring declaring that your body is really you
will i take my rest have i passed the test?
but now the world should wait
oh angel sent from up above
i hate to say the farmer
that is the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
but i do not know how to get down
in the night the stormy night away she would fly
a river that will not subside
that stuff is for the big cities
wet beast and rotten sodden hay
i guess i will call it sickness gone
i put one hand on your round ripe heart
some say that hell is heaven
oh oh oh yeah oh oh yeah oh oh yeah
there is a lobby with nine hundred windows
there is garbage in honey is sack again
we have never seen anything like it before
and i will do it for you
could it babe? could it babe?
we stopped to drink some wine
to all those little girls and boys
whoa i suggest you step out on your porch
it is the rocket that ignites itself
i have heard it all before
when you try to make a good thing last
the shades go down it is in her head
do not set me free i am as heavy as can be
she says 'time to make me bleed'
boy and girl fall in love
my baby is love had gone
he is lost to the third
will i take my rest among the blessed?
can you tell me why the bells are ringing?
he is in his birthday suit
on your side of the bed
oh and i am gonna buy this place that is what i said
we are glad to have you home
sometimes things are not the way they seem
i fell in love with rinfy the gypsy
here somewhere in the heart of me
or shall i wear a red yes
where it goes where it comes ca not see through the faith
clockwork angels spread their arms and sing
maybe you have seen my picture
a thousand people in the street
she keep me worried all the time
but i lost god in a new york minute
with the wrong rendition of the wrong hook
you better pray baby pray baby pray baby
who is that hiding in the apple tree clinging to a branch
i am gonna crown my days a turn
well it is a crime of the heart
oh and i am pushin' oh if i could get above
and this year it is long trousers
and i ai not gonna tell it twice
from uptight short sighted narrow minded hypocrites
the netherworld is gathered in the glare
you leapt into the abyss but find
i called for me a candle
i swear her hair is midnight black
home we gave her everything money could buy
my lonely little heart would have broke again
a spider web and it is me in the middle
wanna fall i fall so far
they can comfort you some even try
ai not a day goes by i do not burn a little bit of my soul
i am so afraid that i will lose it
there is still a part of me
i still remember why do not you do not you
well mad mathildas in his jacket
i know i was born and i know that i will die
if i could learn to give like a rubberband
do not let me know we are invisible
still got such a long way to go
it is late but it ai not never
and hung on a willow tree
like two comets heading for a bed
it is not ours to understand
everybody is out to get you
and when she came back she was nobody is wife
and that is the only feeling
and these are my many letters
old memories are slowly fading out of me
this is my life ticking away
sister will you stand by me
she hit me right between the eyes
cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
and all the morning glows anew
we shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
these walls that still surround me
and say 'it is all been done'
like petals in the wind we are puppets to the silver
with the chilliest bunch in the land in the land
but it could not be true
you might see me down in alabama
he will never make the screen
those were the good old family times
that is your vision growing dim
and i come here to talk
when the tears come streaming down your face
with the rain on my face
will i walk the long road we all walk the long road
the haves have not a clue
over the hills on the horizon
will all of his licks and his r'n'b
i shake my pretty little head i shake my pretty little head
[incomprehensible] that build high like a mountain
twist and turn 'til you have got it right
dressed up in the mask of tragedy
do not tell me hard luck stories
you must learn what makes me kind
you put me on a shelf
oh brother i ca not i ca not get through
i feel safe when i am with you
to buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own
had his woman long as he can remember
my life is changing in so many ways
to our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
leave your troubles at the door
how god could show me somethin'
bueno sera i will come in quick
and the mercy seat is glowing
i have got someone who is there for me
before it is too late for me
i am the new god of panic
some old-timers wanna stay the same
some are phantoms some are real
do you want to be the ditch around a tower?
i am in the hands of fate
come on now do not you want to see?
live for today you said live for today
big money make a mighty head
she will be flying over my home in about three hours time
no one makes me feel the way you do
she the wrong wrong girl for me
i wear my crown of shit
i will be doing my best
well you have been so long it is been so long
and i pray to the only one
forbidden fruits for me to eat
she do not use much though just to get around
used to be you here beside me
hey babe i know that all things pass
it is short it is simple it is crystal clear
i would give my soul to the devil
the sun comes up in the morning
we took our souls and we flew away
i will be like that girl who trained all her life as a distance runner and then
but then you came my way
she says 'time to make me scream'
once the road lay open like a girl
uninvited as you know he do not wait
i could build such beautiful buildings
this will be the last time
he is an utter creep and he
i love you! now me! i love you!
their symmetry gets right inside me
who is gonna wake you up
used to play in a rock 'n roll band
you know i hate to ask
i used to build these buildings
if i do i will surely i will lose a lot
and i say to the sleepy summer rain
and she is heaven and hell
thought i would got you off my mind
talk to me and you can see
and see your eyes are lifted to god
it runs both cold and deep
janey is gone oh people oh lord
runners until the race is run
or the guiding hand of fate
body parts are starting to appear and scare
you can crawl on the floor
the boys are like baby-faced girls
mountain-size on the white stone wall
oh reach the door a breath and a scr oh reach the door
well his cattle each have numbers
she wanted to test her husband
you can keep me at a distance if you do not trust my resistance
her train is moving down the platform and is drawn away
and wade down the gutter and the moon
and all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
not pain not failure not fatal tragedy?
the keeper of the key to the locks
it is been such a long week
live for yourself there is no one else
oh the minute i put them on
people say do not rock the boat
but i got news for them
and yet my day is not so full
please help me to help you help yourself
and watch the world go round
and my trousers ride down to my ankles
put your hate in a box
has found his final resting place
elegant story of what could have been
tying dying flowers around the room
it is the smell of burning
he might as well have buttons and bows
out of the corner of my eye
you will be shooting up on anything tomorrow is never there
or i thought we had a chance
with the beauty of the word
and i put her in a garden she would
i tell myself before i go to sleep
like a pain in the cold i will be yours
the flecks did float and dance
i loved it! i loved her!
just when i think i am king
i watch you disappear past club med vacations
i did not see the cracks form
let your conscience be your guide
i will start before i can stop
but they ca not see your appeal
the adjectives they are all a blurring
pretends to sleep as he looks her over
another habit says he is long overdue
here come is your bride with her veil on
i am the footsteps on your floor
it is like a film - such balance
and the moon tells a lover is story
the burdens that you carry now
in your thin and fading forms
i do not know a book from countdown
all we want is the truth
you might say we are unlearned
like the girl who acted on the tv
and you never have been tempted
i have torn everyone who reached out for me
there is no space for the regrets
a lot better than i think i am
on the back of every magazine
and i am by your side
green sleeves you are all alone
what makes me the big attraction anyway
yeah let it be let it be
then i am bound for movin' on
than training these guns on the men in the sand
we can do the old things
but there is that same unhappy feeling
i do not believe in forever
oh my darling oh my darling
i have tried it all before
had a ' ford had payments on that
life has your mind and soul
me i just sighed with relief
and the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle
and if he touches you again with his stupid hands
five five five five five against one
my love you are such an idiot
i can feel they are here
he is asking to be born
i can see angels around you
you chose your journey long before
i am not missing out on the promise of adventure
thirty years ago how the words would flow
lost and aimless like their brothers
wild bells rang in a wild sky
now it is much too late
take him up to the top where the mountains stop
the light and the darkness divide
do not wanna reel it in
and this line is your path
so i emptied out your drawer
i wake to find you sitting here
like muhammad it is the truth
filling me up with the shivers and quivers
all the towns people gather around
mummy is annoyed says go and play
i pity the fool i said i pity the fool
if it is o k with the boss
all in a day is work go get paid work
she holds the hand that holds her down
but i really does not matter
they are runnin' out of trees they got to give it a rest
another young heart to play with
there is a lot to be learned
oh oh i believe in miracles
with no power nothing to do
all the time to love all the time
and there are no grapes upon the vine
take a look at those clowns
time if nothing else will do its worst
for my head on a silver plate
and he lights up the proceedings
what can i say? i am heading for the door
i shot i shot i shot him honey!
you know you hardly stopped to pick them up
the mo-o-o-on its huge cycloptic eye
they are riding on the streets
and all men are just mortals and
and everybody knows that it is now or never
hit it! make it a dead one
playin' ai not the same without you here
he left back home with his wife
i left before i got out of it
building bridges on the ocean floor
time is still the infinite jest
by the light of the moon
send in words that i believe
i do not know what i want
and the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle
it is written in the stars above
i would make up some game
but everyone knows what has got me
come closer and talk to me
i saw some flowers growing up
o cabin fever! o cabin fever!
i am a child i last a while
how christ was born into a manger
i turned to look but it was gone
that i started looking for a warning sign
time only can lead you on
babe i want to be your man
now all i want to do is forget
still you will never hit the mark
he hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall
see me crumble and fall on my face
when you know that you have been taken
but i am just a dusty soul
you think you will never get it right
in the future where will i be?
when we let our barriers fall
i am like a dead man hiding in the dark
they tell me god forgivin' everything you do
falling from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to take me
now would be the time to be heard
the brink of war on an unseen shore
how long do i have to climb
watchin' the flags of freedom flyin'
i wanted to get right with it with you
and i will run to you
so i will just write some love to you
then we will throw it on the fire
if you were me what would you do?
ten years ago on a cold dark night
our engineer had a different idea
let me out with the spray can soul
hidden by a disk of golden light
the days may not be fair always
knocking down edith is tiki torch
whom i will teach you to repair
when love was good when love was bad
if we all hold hands and very quietly shout
about a man who left from nowhere to be someone
there was a child named bernadette
there ai not no way of telling
i do not believe in belief
nothin' i say is written in stone
the name i am letting go
now someone else has taken your place
showing me the way to god
but i am so tired of this
to walk the caves of ice
we used to sit on the steps at school
and many thoughts for you are near
so come over just be patient and do not worry
you are my angel you are my queen
frannie dressing down for the enemy
i see dead men kneel before the cross
and some say she had a broken heart
your breath curls from your lips
these rocks i am climbin' down
but by then it will be winter there ai not too much for you to do
you are dancing slow you are dancing fast
and now you are lonely every night
vishnu and gaea aztec and maya
designate my will my will my will i will
she wants to smile with your smile
the chains are locked and tied across the door
so the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed
i have never lived at all
up in flames we have slowly gone
afraid that i care too much
and all come crashing down again
so i ran away from you
it is time we should be going
look up to see a giant boy
see the man who ca not pick out his own tie
they say nothings is wrong forever
he smiles and says he is pleased to meet you
she sure got him on the wedding list
yeah it is an angry world
still dirty from the digging done
there you stood on the edge of your feather
for the christ who has not risen
oh if i did not i am a fool you see
i could laugh in the snow and rain
i ca not breathe the air
all the time it is a changing like now
we can be heroes forever and ever
[dedicated to a m klein -]
i will give it a try
understand she is a force of nature
it is not a matter of conscience
i turn my back to the wind
'though shalt not blaspheme cuss holler or bawl'
do not pick fights with the bullies
it is the devil is door
and the world is full of life
our ship is come in and it is sinking
love can fade with the stars at dawn
it is a bike! what a surprise
you would not believe what i have been through
ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes
but looking back over my shoulder
will you take off your dress and send it to me?
he sleeps with a chain saw
i ca not see what we fear
where the sun will rise no more
with the first rain filling the bone-dry river bed
when we walk we walk to you
for the boy that she once knew
and like a dog he comes
so i am flying away away
but what am i to do?
and the night is all wrong
if you mean it say loud
the hospital and the nurses gone
she is a widow all in red
living in lies by the railway line
there moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
i do not need a pardon no no no no no
maids of bond street should not have love affairs
but the way the story goes
i will just pilot the motor
not steering by the venal chart
she wanted to see the deep blue sea
dream up a new self for himself
the case of george the wipe
she is at the door she wants to score
but things ai not that bad
some kind of pictures on the sense o'clock news
but you are not a swallow!
touch me hold me how my open arms ache
and you ah? you do ah?
someone is calling me but vaguely
i was drifting for half the night
knock knock who is there in this baby?
not at the centre the centre of the world
and leave no observer to mourn
ah they do not let a woman kill you
forgive us now for what we have done
and if you want another kind of love
and look out look out look out
i miss you since the place got wrecked
playing tricks with hearts quite as young as yours
i sing it loud and clear
the nights they are so long now
maids of bond street should not have worldly cares
we are the ones who have to try
jesus taken joyous by a few
three forms four forms five forms six forms
things will be different then the sun will rise from here
did not know that heaven died and went to hell
he sawed at the wood with half a heart
and he is made her to lie down on red roses
no time like the present to get ripped apart
would survive someone on their own
i plugged my wife in just for show
i climbed the hill lay in the grass
who have left their pride on the other side of
judy i will raise a tent of shelter
people were drownin' in their own
it is light enough light enough
if you are squeezed for information
i said i need some love!
i am living in a walled-up place in the bounds of fifth symphony
he heard a sound so beautiful
between the ocean and your open vein
i feel the sense of possibilities
the poor stay poor the rich get rich
now look there just [below] the water
it is so cold it is so cold
in love with this elegant bitch
a smoke ring hovers above his head
little white shadows blink and i missed em
how i prayed just to get away
i ca not talk of anything but you
all the dark horse fields befriendin' me
the sun just slipped out of the sky this is a black letter day
in my head you are the only one i have ever loved
she will be your living end
all of my nights and all of my days
one man standing near the edge of a quiet breakdown
he is a little bit afraid of dying
oh do you know you have the face of a genius?
not for just the summer and the winter going sour
give the world a chance to say
angels we work on his sinews
looked like black and white movies
to shoot some of those missiles
left a hole in the wall
but your smile is too grim
just a face in the wall
how long how long has that evenin' train been gone?
