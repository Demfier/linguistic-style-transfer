We meed to start treating our mental wounds as we would our physical wounds. My advice is not to judge anyone unless you have walked in their shoes. Help them instead, lend them a shoulder to cry on or an ear that will listen. Show compassion and kindness. Don't tell anyone who is suffering just to get over it because that is a sure fire way to make things worse. Help them get through it because at the end of it, you will both be stronger and better people for it. #help #advice #compassion #kindness #shouldertocryon #quoteoftheday #instaquote #inspire #helpinghand #love #depression #mentalillness #wounds #suffering #sufferinsilence #stronger #ily #janoskians @beaub",
