You guys have helped me through so much. Not only you though but most of the time you guys? your songs and vines helped me laugh when times were tough so I wanted to thank you. Although I haven't met you guys yet I know I will soon. (Can You Guys Come To Digifest Creative Colab Tour?) I just wanted to let you know I love you and thank you for what you do. (Can you tell Madison I adore her\u263a\ufe0f) <Thx.      #contest",
