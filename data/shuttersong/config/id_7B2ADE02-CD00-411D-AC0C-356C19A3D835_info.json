This is just something I wrote  \u2764\ufe0f People don\u2019t understand, well people don\u2019t understand a lot,but people will never understand what it's like to love someone that\u2019s so out of reach it\u2019s not funny until they\u2019re in the situation. You\u2019re stuck in this unrealistic world, where you think you think you have a shot, a shot at something, whether that be a friendship with you boys or a relationship or just to be noticed. You think you have something special, you like to think you\u2019re the one. You like to think that you will be the one he kisses goodnight or the one he text to tell you how much he loves you. You like to think he\u2019s the one and one day you\u2019ll meet him and he\u2019ll instantly fall in love with you. You like to think that all these fanfictions will one day come true. But it\u2019s all lies, you\u2019ve made it all up, from him kissing you goodnight to you having a future with him. Not only are there all these other girls going for him but there are billions of other girls that walk this earth and chances are you\u2019re not the one he falls for. And yeah it hurts, it hurts so fucking much. But you love him, so you\u2019re okay with him being happy with someone else, because he\u2019s happy and when he\u2019s happy so are you. Yeah you might be heartbroken but he\u2019s not. And it sounds stupid because your happiness depends on his happiness, but that's how this works, he smiles and so do you, he laughs and so do you, he finds someone to love and you hurt buts that's okay because he's not hurting,you thought you were the one, but you\u2019re not you\u2019re just a fan. A fan, a fan among millions. And I wish it wasn\u2019t that way, but you guys aren\u2019t at fault, I am. You didn\u2019t tell me to fall in love with you, I mean no one did, I was falling before I even knew it. But even though i will never be \u201cthe one\u201d dosen\u2019t mean I will stop supporting you, because why would I stop my happiness? I wouldn\u2019t. You guys keep me going, you guys keep me smiling and laughing, you guys keep me sane. You guys keep me happy. And I wouldn\u2019t change a thing because i\u2019m happy as long as you are. #beausvalentine @beaub",
