There is a rumour that domestic violence is more common during the super bowl, and even though that rumour has nothing to back it up, it is still widely believed. It is due to this belief that I felt this was the best time to post this. If you are in an abusive relationship, please call the Domestic Violence hotline @ 1-800-799-7233 (America), 0808-2000-247 (UK), or whatever it may be for your area. If you aren't in danger but would like more information on the problem of abuse, please go to NoMore.org",
