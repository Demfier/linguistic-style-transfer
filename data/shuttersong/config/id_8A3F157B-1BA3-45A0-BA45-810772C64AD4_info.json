They mean the world to me and I don't know what I'd do without them sometimes. Their music makes me feel alive, and when I hear their voice or see their smile I get butterflies in my stomach and my heart feels like it's gonna fall out of my chest. People sometimes tell me that they'll never notice me, talk to me, or even remember me. I don't believe them and like to forget them. because in my heart I know in some way these are true. They DO know me and remember me in some way. anyways... all I'm trying to say is that not all heroes wear capes. This was for you boys. I'll love you forever and always ? --- and thank you all including jacks' for making my 2015 amazing and one of the best yet! love you and I can't thank you enough. @JackandJackOfficial",
