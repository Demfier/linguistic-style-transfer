    "caption": "I really hope that everyone still stays and supports Jack and Jack because I know even if some of us won't win the contest we would be disappointed but I noticed lots of people who pretended to like them just so they could meet someone famous which really hurt me. I hope the people that win actually support them as the people they are. Including letting them make their own decisions and supporting them the entire way. But anyways the point was I hope the people who truly love Jack and Jack stick with them. Because I know they'd stay by our sides ??? idk if I'm supposed to write contest behind this but #contest #contest #contest",
