You have lifted me out of my darkest days and put a smile on my face. I know so many people say this but you are honestly the reason I am alive today. This picture explains how I felt when we finally met. I was so so so thankful, I was so so glad I didn't end my life during my hardest times- I was FINALLY with the person who saved me, I finally was able to touch you and talk to you in real life and not behind a screen. I just really want you to know what you really have done for me.... Happy Valentines from Ireland. I love you with all my heart, thank you so much ? #BeausValentine xxxx",
