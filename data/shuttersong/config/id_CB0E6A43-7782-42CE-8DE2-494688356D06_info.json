I was in section 25 and as celebrities walked past we would see them go into that building. as we first got there I rushed over to ask who it was. A girl was like its Jack Gilinsky and Jack Johnson! I was like oh my god no way. then the girl standing in the front saw I had a gilinsky shirt on and said here stand here quick! and I did and this is what happened, I know the wave wasn't just to me but this was the first time I felt amazing in so long. I can't even thank that girl enough. (Anyways IM OFF SCHOOL AND IM SO HAPPY!!) ???",
