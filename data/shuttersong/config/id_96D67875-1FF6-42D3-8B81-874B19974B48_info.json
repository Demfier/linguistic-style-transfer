My names Angie, and although I've been in this fandom for about a year now, I'm just as loving and dedicating as everyone else. My parents are in a financial problems right now, and I'm too young to get a job. I only have birthday money, which is only $60 and all meet and greet tickets are sold out for Dallas anyways. I love your Calibraska EP, California is my favorite. I still listen to your other songs too though ?\u2764\ufe0f Especially Tides, Bucket List, RWYA, and Coldhearted. All of your music is great . I really love you guys and would love to meet you ! I only need one ticket though, so if I win I'll give away the other ticket to someone else who deserves it so much. #contest \u2764\ufe0f??",
