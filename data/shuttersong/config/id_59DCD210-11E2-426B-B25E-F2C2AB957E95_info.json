Love this song more than anything. It always makes me smile and brings me up when i am down. Its crazy how this single has already been out all around the world for almost a year. Anyways i love you so much Jack and Jack, thank you for everything you have done for us? @jackandjackofficial @jackjohnsonofficial @jackgilinskyofficial #contest",
