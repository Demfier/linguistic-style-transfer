Yes, I have had the privilege to meet the boys once when they visited London but honestly it wasn't a good experience due to the staff and I would LOVE the opportunity to see my favourite people in the world again. I've been supporting Jack and Jack for over 2 years now and I'm so proud of my babies and how far they have come. So please please choose me to win this so I can bring my best friend in the whole world who loves the boys with everything she has! Also the competition closes a few days before my birthday so it would be a wicked 16th birthday present :) :)",
