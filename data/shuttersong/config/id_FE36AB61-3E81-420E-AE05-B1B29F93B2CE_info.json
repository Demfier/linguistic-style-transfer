I also can't believe it because most of the time you act like your 12 which is one of the things I love about you. lol. but anyways happy birthday johnson! I hope this year is one of your best. l love you so flipping much you have no idea. you make me happy and make me cry in laughter most of the time. i always somehow learn your verses which I don't know how but you are so talented and I don't know what i would do without you baby face. I really do hope and I will meet you someday because I mean your Johnson who wouldn't want to meet you. and again love you and hope 20 treats you good ?\u2764\ufe0f #happybdayjohnson",
