I finished an interview with the local nursing home and an essay for my Human Services course, I finished creating a website about anxiety for my psych course, I finished a pamphlet about he issues facing the transgender community for my Social Problems course, I celebrated my cousins communion (though I'm not religious), and I finished a review of quite possibly the worst video game I have ever played for the website I work for. It's time to sleep and prepare for class in the morning (like I'm actually going to fall asleep after staying up till for five am for two days in a row. My sleeping schedule is shot lol.)",
