Sexually, I had never even touched nor seen her, though she had touched me. This only made people who didn't know me or already hated me angry, and most of the school didn't fall for it. However, I fled my problems, and began home-schooling, a choice that would make my life worse later on down the road. Don't get me wrong, I loved home school! I feel like I learned a lot more in that environment than I did in school where I had to deal with bullies and social norms. However, the terrible state of New York doesn't recognize home schooling as legitimate (even though the rest of the country does!) I did two years of home school for nothing and still had to get my GED, which sucked.",
