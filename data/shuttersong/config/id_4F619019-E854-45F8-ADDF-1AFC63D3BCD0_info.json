My favorite Jack and Jack song is probably Tides because it tells you never to give up and to never back down. In the past few years people have really been trying to tear me down. \"...keep your head above the water and i know you'll find someway to breathe...\" This line helped me so much because it told me to keep going and not to listen to other people's negativity. California is another one of my favorites because Johnson spits straight fire?? and Gilinsky's voice is??. i really hope I get to meet my idols. xoxo #contest @jackandjackofficial @jackjohnsonofficial @jackgilinskyofficial",
