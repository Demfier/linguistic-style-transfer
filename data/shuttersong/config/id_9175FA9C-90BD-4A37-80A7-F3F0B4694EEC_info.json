I wish they come back to Boston soon cause I can't wait any longer to meet them? I saw them at Digifest MA but the meet and greet for GA got cancelled and that was my one chance to meet them cause I couldn't meet them in Boston for the Verizon opening (I had a placement test fort freshman year)? I want to meet them so bad words can't explain it? I love these boys with all my heart??",
