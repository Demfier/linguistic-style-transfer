As days pass I just lose hope that I will ever met them. They all have helped me get threw things that have made me want to die. Even though they do not even know who we are they love us very much and some day hopefully we both will be able to met them. I really do not care if they follow me all I care about is them noticing me and knowing that I am real. I really hope we both will be able to met them and would be able to tell them how much we love and care for them. I know that they wont most likely read this so it will suck. I just really hope they do so they all or both can know that we love them so much and we care about them all. @beaub @brooksluke @beaub @brooksluke @beaub @brooksluke @beaub @brooksluke @beaub @brooksluke @beaub @brooksluke @beaub @brooksluke @beaub @brooksluke",
