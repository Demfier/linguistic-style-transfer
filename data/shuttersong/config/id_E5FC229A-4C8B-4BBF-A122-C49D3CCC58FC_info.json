They both did amazing from videos I saw today and it seemed like they had so much fun. which is all I would hope. all I know now is that it's hopefully time to move on and try again because for one thing I am not giving up on meeting someone I've been waiting for, for 2 1/2 years. maybe 2017 will be the year ?? ok im done w/ all these sad shuttersongs now lol.... (Sorry For The Rants)",
