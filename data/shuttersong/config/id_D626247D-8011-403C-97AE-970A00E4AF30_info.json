But acting out of Pride is never a good solution. Deciding to get back at someone is always, always sin. Sin (Pride) will take you farther then you want to go, keep you longer than you want to stay, and cost you more than you want to pay. Choose humility. And please let's stop praising the arrogance of men. I'm choosing to glorify the only man who knew no sin and still CHOSE to become sin anyway, just so that I could become right with God (2 Corinthians 5:21). I was an enemy to Jesus and He died for me (Romans 5:8). That's a true example. A true idol. If we are going to follow anyone, let's follow Jesus and live in humility. ",
