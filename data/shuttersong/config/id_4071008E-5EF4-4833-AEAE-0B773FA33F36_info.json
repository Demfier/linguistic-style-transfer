I went to wash towels and I couldn't find the bleach so I asked my mom and she said\"I can't trust you with the bleach. I will wash them. You have too much going on and I don't want you to do something you'll regret\" I feel like dying now. I really need a hug from one of the boys or Jacqui or Amy or Amelie just anybody. She doesn't know that I breathed in the bleach fumes a couple weeks ago. Idk how she found out that I didn't wanna be here  anymore.",
