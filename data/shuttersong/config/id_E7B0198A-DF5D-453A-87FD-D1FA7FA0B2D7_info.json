I've been through rough times last year and it got really difficult for me to keep moving, cause everything around me was nothing but pain... But one day, my friend show me one of your videos and I started to \"smile\" again, not only when I was with my friends, but also when I didn't have to fake it! I went to see you in Brussels because I had promised her and after that I started running this fan acc, just to show you how grateful I was to have you in my life and to thank you for everything you did for me \u2764\ufe0f I love you so freaking much, and I feel like the words are not strong enough to express how I feel about you! \nI'll never thank my friend Lia enough for talking about you, and I really think that you should give her a follow, since she actually came to see you in London, Brussels and Madrid! You recognized her every time! So time to follow her \u2764\ufe0f @tequilaforjames \n I love you so freaking much Luke, until the end \u2764\ufe0f Tina \u2764\ufe0f",
