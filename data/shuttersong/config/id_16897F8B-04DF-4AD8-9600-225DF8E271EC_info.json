You read my letter. I'll never forget that night, I'll never forget your beautiful words and I'll never forget the way you said my name. \nNow my next goal is to hug you, and one day I'll make it happen. I promise.\nI love you, Happy Valentines Day Beau\u2764 \nForever yours, Lucrezia \n\nP.S. I did this edit to say that I'll always be here for you, I don't want your money, cause you make me happy everyday and that's enough for me. Once again,Happy Valentines Day Beau, and thank you for all",
