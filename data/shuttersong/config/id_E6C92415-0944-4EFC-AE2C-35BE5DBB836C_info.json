They were honestly born to entertain people! Whether it be with comedy, rapping, singing, or any of the many qualities the fools have. They could have the whole world at the palm of their hands if people knew how talented they are. I love these two fools so damn much! I am so damn proud of how far they've come and I'm excited to see what they bring in the future! ?",
