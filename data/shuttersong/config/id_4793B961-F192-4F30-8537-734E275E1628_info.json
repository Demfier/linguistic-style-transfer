I used to hate the scar on my face or the psoriasis on my skin but, I realized that there's somethings that I just have no control over. Those flaws make me who I am. I was so worried about hiding them and trying to get rid of them that I didn't realize that they made me beautiful. I may not be beauty to everyone but I'll damn sure be perfect to someone one day. And until then, I'll just love myself .. And the boys of course \ud83d\ude0c",
