We have been through so much together and we have shared so many great memories and I will forever cherish them. You're so amazingly beautiful and I can't imagine life without you. You have changed me so much and I probably wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. You have stood there by my side through the tough times and the most hardest decisions and you always know what to do and know how to make people happy when they are feeling down ? keep doing what you have been for so many years and I will always love you for you no matter what ?",
