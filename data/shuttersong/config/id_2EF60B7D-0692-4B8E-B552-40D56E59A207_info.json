I've been waiting for such a long time and I know that this is, like, my only chance and I am taking it. Jack and Jack can always ligthen my mood, and make me happy. Me, being a teenager who lives in Iceland, always creating scenarios in my head about the jacks and I meeting. This opportunity could be my last and that's why I really want to win. #contest ",
