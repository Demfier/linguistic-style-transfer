I still fear that she will start spreading around that I \"raped\" her again. Most of her friends from the time have seen who she really was and are back in contact with me. They hate her now, one of them even going as far as to say she'll protect me from my ex-abuser. ? I hear that some of them are still loyal to her, and I hope that those people are safe. Nobody deserves abuse, not even the scum of the earth. To those of you who took the time to read these last 7 long and emotional posts, I thank you so much. Writing these brought back a ton of memories and pain, but it must be said, for myself and others in the situation. If you are in an abusive relationship, than please, get help in whatever safe way you can.",
