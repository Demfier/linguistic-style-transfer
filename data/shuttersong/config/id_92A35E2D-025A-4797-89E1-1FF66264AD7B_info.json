The people who made the \"sticks and stones\" saying have got it all wrong; sticks and stones hurt, yes. But so do words, words hurt more than sticks and stones. You can recover from being hit by a stone, but you can never fully recover from someone's harsh words. They stick with you. No matter how many times you tell people you just laugh all the hate off. Words can be deadly.  I know the photo has no relevance to what I've just said, but just think about it, and chill out. Also, sorry the photo is really blurry .xx",
