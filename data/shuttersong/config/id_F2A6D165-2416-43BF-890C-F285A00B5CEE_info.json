I wear leg braces but I also walk independently. I'm only in a wheelchair when I go to concerts or big events because I get really tired after a while. It would be an honor to meet you guys again because you really encourage me to believe that anything is possible and that I can always achieve my goals. I miss you guys so much and I really hope I get to meet you again at least once more to let you know what an inspiration you really are to me and to thank you in person for this. I love you so much \u2764\ufe0f. #contest #contest #contest",
