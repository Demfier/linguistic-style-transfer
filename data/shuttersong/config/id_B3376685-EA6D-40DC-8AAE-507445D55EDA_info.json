It's really hard for them having millions of girls against them for giving someone a personal life as well. If your love the boys so much why are you giving so much hate to their partners because they love them that much it hurts them too! I love all the boys partners and I think their all just fucking goals and I really do hope they stay together for as long as possible because their happy. Oh and the song is just a random so ? beau please could you read my first post it would mean my ass to me cus like my ass is bigger than this world so ? @beaub",
