You (and the other janoskians) have given me the confidence to stand up to all the bullies and helped me with my depression ALOT! I really hope that I can meet you one day and my little brother wants to as well! I'm hopefully coming to Another Fail Tour! Also, thank you for following me on here and Instagram; it means so much to me\u2764\ufe0f",
