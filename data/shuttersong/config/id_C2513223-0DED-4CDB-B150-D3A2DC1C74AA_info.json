I love you so much \ud83d\ude0d Please never stop doing what you're doing, without you and the rest of the boys I wouldn't be alive and typing this tonight. I love you so much I'm literally having the worst day ever and I just need you to know how much you mean to me. You have seriously helped me through so much, from depression, anxiety, self harm and just generally not wanting to be alive, I'll never be able to thank you enough, I love you so much",
