Im almost 17 and i still wear Disney jumpers or shirts to school literally everyday , even my teachers have told me to grow up because Disney is too childish (exact words from my theatre teacher) . I may grow up physically , but forever ill be in Never land because my imagination will never end , I cant and wont grow up. All my thanks to J.M Berrie , and Walt Disney for bringing the story to life.",
