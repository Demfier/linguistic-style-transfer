I really don't think it matters. I've heard so many people say: \"the winner should be someone that hasn't met them before\".... It shouldn't matter you guys. I understand that we all want to meet jack and jack and it would be amazing. But I think the winner should deserve to meet them (again or first time) because they are a great supporter and accept all of the boys' decisions and accepts their life style. That's what's most important here. Not weather we've met them or not. That shouldn't matter. Anyways... Good luck to everyone and I'm so excited to see who the winner is soon!?\u2764\ufe0f @jackandjackofficial @jackjohnsonofficial @jackgilinskyofficial @w",
