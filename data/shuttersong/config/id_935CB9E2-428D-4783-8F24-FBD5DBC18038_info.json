I lost my cat aka my better half Friday 12th February, lost mg rabbit today (13th February), beside that is my great-grandma is in the hospital and beside that it's not even two months I lost one of my rabbits (which sounds stupid and shit, but she meant the world to me because I had had her from she was a little baby rabbit). School is putting a fucking pressure on me and always need to fight these stupid thoughts. Beau this would mean the world to me and it would really help me cheer up which I really fucking need. Valentine's is just a regular day for us single people, but I'm sure you can make mine a little more special and you can make me a little more happy. @beaub #BeausValentine",
