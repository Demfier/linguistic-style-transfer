I'm from Brazil ?? and I know it's kinda far from US, but I would travel any distance to see you guys. I don't love you just because you're both extremely hot ??, I love you because your songs put me in a different mood, you're so talented. You guys really deserve to be where you are, I wish you all the best and whenever a new EP or a new song comes out on iTunes I'll buy it for sure. I would do anything to meet you guys, see you, look at your face really close, hug you even if it's just for a second. And your smile, there's something so sweet about them. Just by seeing your smile my day gets wayy better. I'm so jealous of Madison for dating Gilinsky ??. I freaked out when I saw on the Distance song folder that you put a phrase in Portuguese. #contest #contest #contest #contest #contest \n??Fly with me. Take me to your concert.\n  ??You're both my boys, so don't forget it.\n ??All I really know is that you're coming across like just my type, must have come from the Gods. \n??You make me feel like no one else exist.\n  ? ?I never thought I would find boys like you, but here you are always making me laugh, always making my day better. \nLove u ??\u2764 and the shuttersong with my flag, the Brazilian flag made me go insane. I love you guys more than anything, if I'm the lucky one who wins and see you guys I wouldn't be able to contain my happiness, I would scream, cry, sing, I would go insane. I just started to cry when I saw the shuttersong and the Brazilian flag. Please boys @JackJohnsonOfficial @JackGilinskyOfficial @JackAndJackOfficial",
