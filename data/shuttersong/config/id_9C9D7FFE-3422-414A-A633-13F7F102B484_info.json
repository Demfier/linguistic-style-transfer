I am so proud that Calibraska was #1 on iTunes for 1 or 2 days! They are incredible talented?and they are soooooooooo good at writing music and every time they wright a new song I'm super excited to here how good it is! When I'm really down I can just watch vines, YouTube videos, and snapchat videos and those 2 will always make me laugh\u2764\ufe0f I hope they never lose their bond! Because it does suck when you lose your bestfriend I've been through! Low key  Johnson is kinda making me turn my Hayes account into a Johnson?butttttttttt I can't wait to see what Jack and Jack have coming out in the future\u2764\ufe0f??? #contest ",
