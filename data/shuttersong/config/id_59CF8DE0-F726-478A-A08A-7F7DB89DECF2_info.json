Digifest was unorganized so I didn't get to meet my idols? and at the Verizon store I had a high school placement test?? I just want one thing in my life and that is to meet my idols, inspiration, and most of all my favorite two people in the entire world? why can't my wish come true? @JackandJackOffcial I love you boys so much words can't explain it???",
