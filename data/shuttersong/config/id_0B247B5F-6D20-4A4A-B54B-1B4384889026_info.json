I WANT SO BAD HIM TO SEE THIS.\nSo let's start. 2 years now I'm a Beau girl and I'm proud for that. Yeah I know that you can't be in love with someone who doesn't ever know you exist. But I'm in love with beau and I really mean it. Butterflies in my stomach every time I see him (on videos etc because I have only seen him one time). Yeah, at me m&g when I was going to hug him I froze because of his eyes. God damn those eyes. I can look at they all day. I hugged him and I was shaking like crazy. I said him that I love him etc and he said that he loves me too and then he looked at my eyes (OMG bye ) and he asked me if I was ready to take the group photo and I was so red (like a tomato hahahaha) and I wanted to say no but I couldn't so I said yes and he just grabbed my hand and held it and he put his hand around my shoulder (and jai put his hand around my waist aw babyyyyy)\nI wanted to asked him for a stage kiss or if I could ride his back but my mind had stopped so I hope next time I will be calm and ask him ?\nGenerally I thank to thank him for making me happy. For making me more confident. And for a lot of other stuffs. Just a big THANK YOU LOML.  And that is going to ALL OF THE BOYS, DANIEL, JAMES, LUKE, JAI AND BEAU. I fucking love them even though they are hoes. Jk. \nCan wait to see you again babies. THANKS FOR EXISTING. \n@beaub *the most pictures are edits*",
