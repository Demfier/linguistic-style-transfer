You're packing magic in, ah
You're making habits in, ah
You're automatic, you are,

The way you are.
You cleared a sparkle in, ah
You glow in the dark in, ah
Make everybody go, "ah"
The way you are.
Blue skies, white highs
Won't blind me, everything you hide
Your shades can't shade in the sunlight, in the sunlight.

Your limousines get stuck in traffic
And we all know you're made of plastic
You may seem like something classic
But you're cheap sunglasses
You're cheap sunglasses
And I see right through you,
And I see right through you.

You're so dramatic and I
I want it badder than I
You're super radical ah
The way YOU ARE
You're double vision and ah
A new religion and ah
What hers and his and then ah
The way YOU ARE

Blue skies, white highs
Won't blind me, everything you hide
Your shades can't shade in the SUNLIGHT, in the SUNLIGHT

Your limousines get stuck in traffic
And we all know you're made of PLASTIC
You may seem like something classic
Your cheap sunglasses
Your cheap sunglasses
And I see right through YOU YOU YOU YOUUU
And I see right through YOU YOU YOU YOUUU
Your limousines get stuck in traffic
And we all know you're made of PLASTIC
You may seem like something classic
Your cheap sunglasses
Your cheap sunglasses
And I see right through YOU YOU YOU YOUUU
And I see right through YOU YOU YOU YOUUU
And I see right through YOU YOU YOU YOUUU
And I see right through YOU YOU YOU YOUUU
