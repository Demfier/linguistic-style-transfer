See that boy just standing over there
He stopped me today said he liked my hair, ooh
He asked me where you going tonight
(Err)
And I said I'm with my girls
(Yeah, is that all right?)

To tell you the truth he was just a lil bit fresh
He said he liked the way I put my lipstick on
He said how many sugars do you like in your tea?
(Um)
I said forget about the sugar have a spoonful of me, 'cuz I taste so sweet

Oh my gosh, he's making eyes at me and I don't mind at all
Oh my gosh, he's making my imagination run wild

Listen to this, yeah
There I was with a drink in my hand
No cares in the world didn't have a plan
I turned around and I caught his eye
He made me lose my concentration

Did you get his number? No
Did you get his name? Um
What score would you give him on a scale of 1 to 10?
I didn't get his number
(I didn't get his number)

I don't know his name
But I think he's hot y'no
And I think he is a 10

Oh my gosh, he's making eyes at me and I don't mind at all
Oh my gosh, he's making my imagination run wild
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)

Oh my gosh, he's making eyes at me and I don't mind at all
Oh my gosh, he's making my imagination run wild
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)

Chinese eyes
Ice cube lips
Feel it in da eyes

Ooh, ooh, I'm feeling you girl
From your head to your feet
'Cuz you look so good I can barely speak
Give me your digits a can phone you
Got all things, I wanna tell you
Oh my gosh, I think I love you

Oh my gosh, he's making eyes at me and I don't mind at all
Oh my gosh, he's making my imagination run wild
