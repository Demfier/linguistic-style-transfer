Barely breathing
Head is under water
At a crossroad
To love or to not
I wanna feel you
Breathe in every motion
I hear you whisper
Stay with me

Stay with me
Cause without you here
I disappear
Into infinity, infinity
Stay with me
Cause without you here
I disappear
Stay with me

I can feel your pain
Pulsing through my veins
Hold on to my hand and pray
You'll find my heart one day
Fight your way through these walls
That you built so tall
I look around and see
It's you that has the key

Stay with me
Cause without you here
I disappear
Into infinity, infinity
Stay with me
Cause without you here
I disappear
Stay with me

Stay with me
Cause without you here
I disappear
Into infinity, infinity
Stay with me
Cause without you here
I disappear
Stay with me
