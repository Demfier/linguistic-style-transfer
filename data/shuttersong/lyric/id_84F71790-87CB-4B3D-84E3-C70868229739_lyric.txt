It's the year of absolutely being absolutely nothing
Absolutely crushing
Absolutely everything
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely

I rode my silver bullet up
To the edge of the sun where I dropped the gun
A sky above and sky below
One last choice to make now: which way to go?

Say, say, say it now
Above this earth, yeah, we can be loud
No more holding back
Break, break, breaking free
No gravity is keeping me down
We're not stopping

It's the year of absolutely being absolutely nothing
Absolutely crushing absolutely everything
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely

Will I touch the face of God?
Could it be a letdown to reach up?
I've got the gold fever to hear the rockets sound
One last chance to leave the ground

Say, say, say it now
Above this earth, yeah, we can be loud
No more holding back
Break, break, breaking free
No gravity is keeping me down
We're not stopping

It's the year of absolutely being absolutely nothing
Absolutely crushing absolutely everything
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely

Cause if you've got a young soul
I know which way that I'll go

Say, say, say it now
Above this earth, yeah, we can be loud
No more holding back
Break, break, breaking free
No gravity is keeping me down
We're not stopping

It's the year of absolutely being absolutely nothing
Absolutely crushing absolutely everything
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely
No more holding back
We're not stopping
It's the year of absolutely being absolutely nothing
Absolutely crushing absolutely everything
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
Absolutely loving
