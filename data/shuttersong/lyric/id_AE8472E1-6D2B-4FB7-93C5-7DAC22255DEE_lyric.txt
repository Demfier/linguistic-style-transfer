Oh yeah yeah
Oooh
Oh!
When the world wanna drive you crazy
Caught up in the day to day and
The walls are closing in on you
When it feels like too much pressure
I can think of something better
Right now do what you want to do
Imagine yourself to be somewhere else
You might as well
Oh yeah (yeah)
Break out, break free to where you wanna be
Find out how it feels tonight
Sail away
Let the music take you anyplace
That you want
Sail away (sail away)
Disappear and let the music play
Til it never stops (yeah)
When you're down and you're feeling lonely
Feelin bad or sad is what you don't need
A change of scenery would do just right
When you wanna write a different life story
Everyday the same, gets a little boring
Why not change it to what you like?
Imagine yourself to be somewhere else
You might as well
Oh yeah (yeah)
Break out, break free to where you wanna be
Find out how it feels tonight
Sail away
Let the music take you anyplace
That you want
Sail away
Disappear and let the music play
Til it never stops (never stops, yeah)
Imagine escaping to wide open spaces
As far as the eye can see
Imagine tonight, picture anywhere you like
If that's where you wanna be
SAIL AWAY!
Sail away
Let the music take you anyplace
That you want
Sail away
Disappear and let the music play
Til it never stops (til itâ€¦)
Sail away
Let the music take you anyplace
That you want
Sail away
Disappear and let the music play
Til it never stops
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
