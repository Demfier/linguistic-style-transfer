Give me love that's unconditional
And I'll cherish your name
Give me all that you could bear to part with
And I'll give you the same

I've been running in the darkness so long
Tryna rewind the past
Who'd have known it was so hard to move on from a love that I never had?

I just need a tender embrace
Be my father figure
Help me to remember your face
Be my father figure, my father figure

Give me shelter, and release my pain
I've been hurting too long
Teach me how I meant to love again
Show me how to be strong

I've been running in the darkness so long
Tryna rewind the past
Who'd have known it was so hard to move on from a love that I never had?

I just need a tender embrace
Be my father figure
Help me to remember your face
Be my father figure, my father figure

I just need a tender embrace
Be my father figure
Help me to remember your face
Be my father figure, my father figure
