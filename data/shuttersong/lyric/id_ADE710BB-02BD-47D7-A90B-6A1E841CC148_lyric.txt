Baby will you be my Corona and Lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Little girls in the city
Dress up pretty
Go out and get messed up and shitty

Girls by the sea dress like hippies
And rock love beads and go skinny dipping
Girls in the hills go day trippin'
To get their nails done and hair straightened
Little girls in the 818 get hot when I roll over
Laurel Canyon

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I do
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I love
She stay at home 'cause she hate the club
Baby butt, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

Baby will you be my Corona and Lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Girls in New York look like giraffes
Long neck, long legs, tiny tits and ass
Girls from L.A. rock oversized shades
And chill all day 'cause they already payed
Girls in Miami, string bikinis and bump techno
By DJ Tiesto
Girls from Detroit like electro and dance all
Night 'til they break they neck, yo

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I love
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I love

Baby will you be my Corona and Lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Now if ya lookin' for love, won't you put ya hands up
(If ya lookin' for love, won't you put ya hands up)
If you're lookin' for love, then I'm lookin' for love
(If you're lookin' for love, then I'm lookin' for love)
Now if ya lookin' for love, won't you put ya hands up
(If ya lookin' for love, won't you put ya hands up)
Now if you're lookin' for love, then I'm lookin' for love, huh
And this is what I'm lookin' for

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I do
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I love
She stay at home 'cause she hate the club
Baby butt, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

Baby will you be my Corona and Lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Baby will you be my Corona and Lime
And I will be your sandy beach
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street
