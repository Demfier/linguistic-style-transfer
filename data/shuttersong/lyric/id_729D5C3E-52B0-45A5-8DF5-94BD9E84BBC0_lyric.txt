First things first

I don't wanna be forgotten
Even worse
I don't wanna be alone
But if it all stops today

Ill probably say
I didn't waste a minute
When I'm finished
Brand new faith

And I'm ready for the camera's mention
And all I pay
And my money and my damn attention
Didn't get me the deal

Got me to feel
How you would hear my sentence
When I'm finished
You could do it for the money, money, money

But the money makes them all the same
Everything's sunny
But the sunshine fades away
Everything's black

And white
No grey.
Pitch black frames

You can see me when I wear my lenses
And all they say
Is I'm fake and I don't get offended
And when push comes to shove

Ill show enough
I didn't need to listen
When I'm finished
You're insane

What you said when I explain the game plan
Nothing's changed
Except a little more change in my hand
Now I don't mean to brag

Life was in fact
Non-witness shows of women
It's not finished
You could do it for the money, money, money

But the money makes them all the same
Everything's sunny
But the sunshine fades away
Everything's black

And white
No grey.
You ended up with gold

But it started as a dream
If I get cold
Put some honey in my tea
I used to be broke, now there's money in my jeans
I was broke now there's money in my jeans
You could do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes them all the same
Everything's sunny
But the sunshine fades away
Everything's black
And white
No grey.
Everything's black
And white
No grey.
