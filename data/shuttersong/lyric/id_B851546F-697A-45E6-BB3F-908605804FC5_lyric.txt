You better believe in karma
baby it's gonna sting
the wheel of life's gonna do you in
so I don't really have to do a thing
you took me outta my money
you messed up my love life and my career
you better believe in karma
guess it's gonna start getting weird right here

Bad karma (oh, yeah)
baby that's what you got
bad karma (oh, yeah)
whether you believe it or not
the universe is gonna getcha
you'll be scratchin' the seven year itch
you know what I think?
bad karma's a Bitch

You better believe in Jesus
'cause only he can save ya now
throw in a saint or two why don't ya
three hail mary's and a hari krishna
you made me drink the kool-aid
you tricked me into think of? Jack
you are the fire spawn of the Devil
but even he won't take you back, back, back

Bad karma (oh, yeah)
baby that's what you got
bad karma (oh, yeah)
whether you believe it or not
the universe is gonna getcha
you'll be scratchin' the seven year itch
that's just my opinion
bad karma's a Bitch

You better believe in karma
just look at the sorry shape you're in
there doll with your name and your gloomy face
and the department up doing a rush on your case
You better believe in voodoo babe
I got a long list of your sins
There's a word you may have heard of
Called payback and I'm runnin'out of pins

Bad karma (oh, yeah)
baby that's what you got
bad karma (oh, yeah)
whether you believe it or not
the universe is gonna getcha
you'll be scratchin' the seven year itch
you know what I think?
Bad karma's a Bitch
