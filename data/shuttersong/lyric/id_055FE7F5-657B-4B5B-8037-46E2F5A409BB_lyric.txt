Forget the peace inside
You've given way to the gods of destruction
Full of desire
You feel afraid that there's nothing left

Oh oh, oh no
Oh oh, oh no

The ocean is dry
Do you feel hollow?
Nowhere to hide
And nothing to swallow

And when you can't recognize
Anything solid
Where do you turn?
When you can't buy it?

What can you believe in now
With no love to follow?
Now that you have lost yourself
Oh, can anything help you now?

Just let your fears go
You might find your way back home
Let your fears go
You might find that you're not lost

Just let your fears go
You might find your way back home
Let your fears go
You might find that you're not lost

What did you learn?
What was it worth?
What did you yearn for?
Everything's lost now

And not alone and not alone
And not alone and not alone
And not alone and not alone
And not alone and not alone

Just let your fears go
You might find your way back home
Let your fears go
You might find that you're not lost

Just let your fears go
You might find your way back home
Let your fears go
You might find that you're not lost
