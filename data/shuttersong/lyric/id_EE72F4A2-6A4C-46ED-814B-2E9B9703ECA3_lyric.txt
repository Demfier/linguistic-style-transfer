As the rain keeps pouring down on me
And the sky is the only thing I see  yeah
And my troubles are gone with the wind
It's just me and the ground beneath my feet
I feel so alive
Mmm  oh I feel so alive
Oh I feel so alive
Oh
Oh I feel so alive
Oh
And the rain keeps pouring down on me
And my shadow is the only thing I see
All my troubles are done with the wind
It's just me and the ground beneath my feet
I feel so alive
Oh I feel so alive
Oh
Bones to bones
They can bring their guns
I'm at war with the world
There is nowhere to run  no
Chest to chest
You can run if you want
I've come too far
Woah  I'm not going to lose
I feel so alive
(Feel so alive)
Oh I feel so alive
(I feel so alive)
Oh I feel so alive
(I feel so alive)
Oh
Oh I feel so alive
Oh I feel so alive
Bones to bones
They can bring their guns
I'm at war with the world
There is nowhere to run  no
Chest to chest
You can run if you want
I've come too far
Woah  I'm not going to lose
I feel so alive
