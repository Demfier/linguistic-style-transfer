Wasted, I play the same part

Where I'm chasing your sick little heart
'Til I'm jaded and lying on the floor
Faded, I'm wrapped in your arms
While you're waiting to tear me apart
Would a last kiss will leave me wanting more?
You, you're catch 22
Win or lose, I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're catch 22
You're catch 22

Restless, I stay awake with the spaces
The thought of our hands interlacing, it's taking over me
Reckless, I'm at your front door and I'm helpless
I'm twisted back up in the madness, repeating history
Promise me, you'll never let me leave
You, you're catch 22
Win or lose I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell

It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're catch 22
You're catch 22
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Let me go, I'm better off alone
And here we go again
You, you're catch 22
Win or lose I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell

It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're catch 22
You're catch 22
Win or lose I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're catch 22
Win or lose I'm screwed
