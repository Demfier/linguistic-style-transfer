She  Looks  So  Perfect  - 5  Seconds  Of  Summer
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Simmer down  simmer down
They say we're too young
Now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard
For this just to give it up now
If you don't swim  you'll drown
But don't move  honey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now  that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now  that I'm so down
Hey  hey 
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Let's get out  let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's
Only here just to keep us down
While I was out 
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring
With your name on it
Would you wanna run away too 
'Cause all I really want is you
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now  that I'm so down
I made a mixtape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped
Skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now  that I'm so down
Hey  hey 
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now  that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now  that I'm so down
Hey  hey 
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Hey  hey  hey  hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now  that I'm so down (hey  hey)
Your lipstick stain is a work of art (hey  hey)
I got your name tattooed
In an arrow heart (hey  hey)
And I know now  that I'm so down (hey  hey)
Hey
