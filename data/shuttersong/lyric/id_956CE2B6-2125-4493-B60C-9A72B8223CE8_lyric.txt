I'll dive in deeper, deeper for you
Down to the bottom, 10, 000 emerald pools
Down to the bottom, 10, 000 emerald pools
Under water
Time is standing still
You're the treasure
Dive down deeper
Still, all I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you!

I'll make a living, trying to get away
10, 000 phantoms, I'll turn the tide away
It can never pull me away
No way!
Under water
Time is standing still
You're the treasure
Dive down deeper
Still, all I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you!
You're all I need to breathe
Down to the bottom, 10, 000 emerald pools
You're all I need to breathe

I'll dive in deeper, deeper for you

You're all I need to breathe
¡°
You're all I need to breathe

All I need is you!
All I need is you!
It can never pull me away-aaay
Time is standing still, aaay
Dive down deeper
Still, all I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you!
