(I'm supergirl)

Sometimes I have dreams
I picture myself flying
Above the clouds
High in the sky
Conquering the world
With my magic piano
Never being scared
But then I realize

[CHORUS:]
I'm supergirl
And I'm here
To save the world
But I wanna know
Who's gonna save me?
I'm supergirl
And I'm here to
Save the world
But I wanna know
Why I feel so alone?

Seems like a dream
But there's one thing missing
Nobody's here with me
(Here with me)
To share in all that
I've been given
I need someone
that's strong enough for me

[Repeat chorus]

Hey ooh

I need someone
I won't stop till
I find the one
Who will stop
The longing in my life
I need someone
I won't stop till
I find the one
Who will stop
The longing in my life

[Repeat chorus]

I'm supergirl
And I'm here to
Save the world
And I wanna know
Who's gonna save me
I'm supergirl
And I'm here to
Save the world
And I wanna know
Why I feel so alone

I'm supergirl
I wanna know
Who's gonna save me
I'm supergirl
And I'm here to
Save the world
