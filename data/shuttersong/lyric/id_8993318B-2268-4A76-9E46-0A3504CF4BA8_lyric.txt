Out in a wild
Party in nowhere land
We start a fire
Sparklers in every hand
No phones, let go
Cut all the strings tonight

Singin' aloud
Howlin' right at the moon
We're making out
Life's never felt so good
Bring on the storm
We're wilin' out tonight

Then you lost your shoes as it started to rain
And your jeans soaked through but you smiled anyway
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air

We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah, we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity
Here in the afterglow
Yeah, we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity
Here in the afterglow

Back of the car
Blankets and me and you
We're running on perfectly wasted youth
I'll hold you close
We'll call this home tonight

And the fake tattoo that you drew on my arm
Had an X and an O
Never change who you are
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air

We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah, we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity
Here in the afterglow
Yeah, we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity
Here in the afterglow

Here in the afterglow

Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air

Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air

We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah, we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity
Here in the afterglow
Yeah, we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity
Here in the afterglow

Here in the afterglow
Here in the afterglow
Here in the afterglow
