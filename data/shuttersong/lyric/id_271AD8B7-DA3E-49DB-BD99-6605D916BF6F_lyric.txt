Oh, we can own the night,
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
oh we can own the night
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
I'll take you to the future
forget about the past
I can keep all of your secrets
I swear that i won't ask

let go of all your trouble
I don't care where you've been
the only thing that matters now
is where the night will end
them bright big lights are shinin' on us (aha)
that beat so tight it makes you wanna (you know)
get up, get down like there's no tomorrow
like there's no tomorrow (nah nah)
like there's no tomorrow

oh we can own the night
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing

I know it'll be alright (hey)
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing

let's get down to Phoenix
show me what you've got
let's keep the record spinnin'
the music never stops
you wanna live forever
and reach above the stars
let's take it to next level
just like the spaceship ah
them bright big lights are shinin' on us (aha)
that beat so tight it makes you wanna (you know)
get up, get down like there's no tomorrow
like there's no tomorrow (nah nah)
like there's no tomorrow

oh we can own the night

yeah, I'm on the rooftop
surrounded by the starts and the view's hot
ain't nobody thinking 'bout what you've got
everything's ours wanna dip get a new spot
yeah (yeah) don't worry don't worry (ah)
night never ends no hurry no hurry
shorty look thick so the lines get blurry
and the night's in your paws so we might get dirty
DJ let the beat play like a heat wave
when you replay this
tonight we gonna party like it's D-day
young and free, say it is the one on my CK shit
the moon is the light, the sky is the ceiling
glow is the pace and the high is the feeling

the world is a club all night
'cause we can this, one for the books
don't worry 'bout a thing

oh we can own the night (oooohh)
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing (I got you)

I know it'll be alright
don't worry 'bout a thing (oooohh)
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
(come on)

oh we can own the night
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
don't worry 'bout a thing
