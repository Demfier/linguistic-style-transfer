Feels Like Home - Lucy Hale\n Ten years old  hair running wild\n Dirt on my face and a naughty smile\n I was so in love with the place that I called home\n Fourteen  growing up fast\n Chasing boys and skipping class\n No boy daring them to kiss me back \n Scared down to the bone\n 'Cause there's\n No one that I gotta be  it all comes down to the simple things\n It feels like home and family  my feet in the red clay\n My heart runs like the Mississippi \n All the way back from the big city\n When the sun goes down at the end of the day \n Nowhere else can make me feel this way\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n Feels like home\n Sixteen on a jet plane\n Yeah  nothing's ever gonna be the same\n Way out here  it don't even rain\n In the city of angels\n Even though I like it here\n I get scared that I'll disappear\n So I Close my eyes  start clicking my heels\n I remember how it feels\n When there's\n No one that I gotta be \n It all comes down to the simple things\n It feels like home and family  my feet in the red clay\n My heart runs like the Mississippi \n All the way back from the big city\n And when the sun goes down at the end of the day \n Nowhere else can make me feel this way\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n Feels like home\n It's where I learned to drive back when I was thirteen\n My dad gave me the wheel then said  "Give it back to me "\n Summer days down in one grown old lake\n We were thinking we were cool like '96 in the shade\n Telling secrets in the southern moonlight \n The way my mom said it's alright to roam \n But this is home\n No one that I gotta be \n It all comes down to the simple things\n It feels like home and family  my feet in the red clay\n My heart runs like the Mississippi \n All the way back from the big city\n And when the sun goes down at the end of the day \n Nowhere else can make me feel this way\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n It feels like home\n Feels like home
