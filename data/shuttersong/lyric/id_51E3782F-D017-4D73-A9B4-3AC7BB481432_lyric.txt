The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know Yeah
We don't have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with
And kill em with kindness

Kill em with kindness
Kill em, kill em
Kill em with kindness
Kill em with kindness
Kill em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
We're running out of time

Chasing our lies
Every day a small piece of you dies
Always somebody, you're willing to fight
To be right
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's the gun
And no war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time your fighting
Kill em with kindness

Kill em with kindness
Kill em, kill em
Kill em with kindness
Kill em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Your lies are bullets

Your mouth's the gun
And no war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time your fighting
Kill em with kindness

Kill em with kindness
Kill em, kill em
Kill em with kindness
Kill em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
