Why do we keep repeating
What we know is unhealthy
My body aches without you
Addicted to you like a drum
My hands are always shaking
With you I'm terrified
The thought of me without you has got me horrified
'Cause if we're being accused while living in this life never satisfied.

Chemical love!
I can feel you in my bones
Chemical love!
Can you feel me in your soul?

Nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!
This situation's clockwork, always rising
Up from the dirt
Only to repeat disaster
Addicted to the way we hurt
Can't breathe for the life of me
I'm drowning in your eyes.

I must be under a spell you've got me
Hypnotized.
'Cause we're running away
But there's no ending you're always my mind

Chemical love!
I can feel you in my bones!
Chemical love!
Can you feel me in your soul?

Nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!
Chemical love!
I can feel you in my bones!
Chemical love!
Can you feel me in your soul?
Nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!
Chemical love!
