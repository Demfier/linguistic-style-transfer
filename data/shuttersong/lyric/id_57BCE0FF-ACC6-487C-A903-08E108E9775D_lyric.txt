My pussy tastes like pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who older
It's always been so, it's no surprise

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds
And he's making me crazy
(Come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is
Party with his pretty baby, yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on come on, come on come on, come on baby
Woah, aah yeah.

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on skid row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds
And he's making me crazy
(Come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is
Party with his pretty baby, yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Drugs suck it up
Like vanilla icies
Don't treat me rough,
Treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck
Diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on come on, come on come on, come on baby
Come on come on, come on come on, come on baby
Woah, aah yeah.
