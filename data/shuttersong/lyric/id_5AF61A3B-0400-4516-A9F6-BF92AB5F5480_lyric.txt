Said you've seen it all before, right?
What about tonight?
Won't you open your eyes,
Take a look outside,
At the open skylight?

She tells me it's a little cold out,
Don't worry we'll fly south,
Come with me girl,
I'll let you know what I'm all about,

Tell me where you wanna go,
We can leave, make it feel like home,
If you're ready let me know
And we'll fly to parts unknown.

And it's flights to L.A.
Trips to Paris,
They could talk but
We couldn't care less girl,
Whoa,
Let you shop in New York
Drink in London,
It's all the same girl,
As long as you're coming,
Whoa, yeah,

Said she's so sick of this town,
We can make the world our playground,
Spend the night in the sky girl,
Tell me how does that sound?

Tell me where you wanna go,
We can leave, make it feel like home,
If you're ready let me know
And we'll fly to parts unknown.

And it's flights to L.A.
Trips to Paris,
They could talk but
We couldn't care less girl,
Whoa,
Let you shop in New York
Drink in London,
It's all the same girl,
As long as you're coming,
Whoa, yeah,

So fly with me, yeah fly with me,
30,000 in the skies,
Where you tryna be?
I can take you to a place that is so exclusive,
It's a view that only me, you, and the pilot see,
As the clouds surround us,
And drown out all the troubles and sounds,
Touch down in the town,
Open your eyes,
Be astounded by the sights all around,
They are incredible,
Itinerary printed out,
Baby I'm way ahead of you

And it's flights to L.A.
Trips to Paris,
They could talk but
We couldn't care less girl,
Whoa,

And it's flights to L.A.
Trips to Paris,
They could talk but
We couldn't care less girl,
Whoa,
Let you shop in New York
