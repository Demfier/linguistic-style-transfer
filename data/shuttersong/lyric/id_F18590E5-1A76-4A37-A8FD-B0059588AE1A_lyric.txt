Ricky Martin
I'm as happy as I can be
Cause I'm allergic to tragedy
The doctor says something's wrong with me
The smile on my face has no remedy

So baby, don't say no
Come on and just say yes
You know it's time to keep it simple

Let's take a chance and hope for the best
Life is short, so make it what you wanna
Make it good, don't wait until manana
I think I'm cool cause your name's on this heart shaped tatoo
Now the best thing about me is you

Oooooh
Joss Stone
I cryin' days on our history (history)

I had a change of philosophy (philosophy)

I take each day as it comes to me
And I won't take myself all that seriously
So Babe, don't say no
Come on and just say yes

You know it's time to keep it simple
Let's take a chance, and hope for the best
Life is short, so make it what you wanna

Make it good, don't wait until mañana
I think I'm cool cause your name's on this heart shaped tatoo

Hon, the best thing about me is you.
It's you
Oh baby, now I see it's you

(Now the best thing, the best thing)
Oh yes it is
(It's true) whoa oh
Ricky Martin and Joss Stone
Take off your shoes, lay back, and take a load off

Give me your blues, let me love it away
Nothing to lose, so don't act like such a grownup
Stay out all night in the moonlight with me
(Don't say no; don't say no)

Come on and just say yes
You know it's time to keep it simple
Let's take a chance and hope for the best
Life is short, so make it what you wanna
Make it good, don't wait until mañana
I think I'm cool cause your name's on the short...
Now the best thing about me is you
It's you
Now the best thing, the best thing, the best thing
About me is you
Now the best thing about me is you.
The best thing about me is you.
The best thing about me is you.
The best thing about me is you
