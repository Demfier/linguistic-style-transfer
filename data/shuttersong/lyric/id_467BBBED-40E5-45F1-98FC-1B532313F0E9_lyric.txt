A perfectly sun day
I think I'm staying now, today
And take it on my way
And somehow I can see your life
Ah, rip then!

And storefronts rarely changed
At least I' m on my own again, instead of
Travelling with you
I'm sorry, it seems
Sometimes I forget my way

And I lost my way again
Ah, this is, this is a chance
And I hope you never change
This life is on my side
And I am the one
\
