We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding into the dark night, night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough
As the silence fill the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here now now babe
We see a storm is closing in
Pretending we're aint scared

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, now now
A quarter tank is almost gone
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line, now now now, baby
We see a storm is closing in
I reach out for your hand

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

Oh oh, hold on

Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
