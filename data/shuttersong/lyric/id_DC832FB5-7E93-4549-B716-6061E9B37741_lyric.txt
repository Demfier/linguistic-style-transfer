"Loving You"
(feat. Ty Dolla Sign)

[Trey Songz:]
I had too many girls, it's true
But now you got me loving you
I got 525,600 women
They come around and we take 'em all down
Kick 'em out when we finish
They cool, but they not like you
Baby girl it's just different
And I don't know what I'ma do
Cause now you got me lovin' you

[Trey Songz:]
Got me lovin' you
Got me lovin'
Now you got me lovin' you
Got me lovin' you
Got me lovin' you
Got me lovin'
Now you got me lovin' you
Got me lovin' you

[Trey Songz:]
New day, new taste
Got a new chick chillin' every second of the day
No old hoes in the new place
Had your shawty over rollin' up a souffl¨¦
Sun rise some way
A nigga gonna change, mama prayin' every day
I told her I'ma do better
And I knew better

[Trey Songz:]
New day, new face
Got a couple just left, got a couple on the way
No solos, it's a group thing
Gotta hit 'em in a group cause they groupies
Sun rise, some way
A nigga gonna change, mama prayin' every day
I told her I'ma do better
And I knew better

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Got me lovin' on your pretty ass, baby
That's why you're my lady
I ain't gon' lie, I fucked about 500 bitches last summer
Ain't none of them like my bae
They ain't gettin' money like bae
Nah she ain't no boss like bae
Tired of these fake ass bitches
You should be somewhere with these fake ass niggas
Cause a real one knows what's real when they see it
Real recognize real when you see it
My ex girl called, told her beat it
And if I make you my girl, I ain't cheatin'
It's my pussy
And it's your dick, and we selfish
And we so rich
Postin' pictures, need to let these bitches know it
Cause you're mine
