Thinking Out Loud - Ed Sheeran\n When your legs don't work\n Like they used to before\n And I can't sweep you off of your feet\n Will your mouth\n Still remember the taste of my love \n Will your eyes\n Still smile from your cheeks \n And  darling \n I will be loving you 'til we're 70\n And  baby \n My heart could still fall as hard at 23\n And I'm thinking 'bout\n How people fall in love in mysterious ways\n Maybe just the touch of a hand\n Well  me\n I fall in love with you every single day\n And I just wanna tell you I am\n So honey now\n Take me into your loving arms\n Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\n Place your head on my beating heart\n I'm thinking out loud\n That maybe we found love\n Right where we are\n When my hair's all\n But gone and my memory fades\n And the crowds don't remember my name\n When my hands don't play\n The strings the same way\n I know you will still love me the same\n 'Cause honey your soul could never grow old \n It's evergreen\n And  baby  your smile's forever\n In my mind and memory\n I'm thinking 'bout how people\n Fall in love in mysterious ways\n Maybe it's all part of a plan\n Well  I'll just keep on\n Making the same mistakes\n Hoping that you'll understand\n But  baby  now\n Take me into your loving arms\n Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\n Place your head on my beating heart\n Thinking out loud\n That maybe we found love\n Right where we are\n So  baby  now\n Take me into your loving arms\n Kiss me under the light\n Of a thousand stars\n Oh  darling  place your head\n On my beating heart\n I'm thinking out loud\n That maybe we found love\n Right where we are\n Oh  baby  we found love\n Right where we are\n And we found love right where we are
