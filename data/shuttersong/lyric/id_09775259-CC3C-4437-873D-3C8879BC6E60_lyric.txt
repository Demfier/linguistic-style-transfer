Lalalalala Lalalala

It’s a sunny and relaxing holiday
I’m wearing my pretty, white dress
I left the house while humming
Lalalalala Lalalala

You’re looking at me, staring at me
The moment I captivated your heart
My trembling voice is like drums in your heart
The twinkling sound of a bell rings

Lalalalala Lalalala
Lalalalala Lalalala Lalalalala

Please give me that sweet taste, ice cream cake
With a flavor that fits this special day
The ice cream that’s on my mouth
Makes your heart pound and you’ll come to me
It’s so tasty come and chase me,
I can’t hold it in I scream, You scream
Gimme that, Gimme that Ice Cream

Oh Vanilla chocolate honey with a cherry on top
I’ll show you different things every day, only to you
More variety than the rainbow reflected in the fountain
I’ll be pulled even more by you, who draws out my love

Take me and go, hurry and go
Put me on a small scooter
My hands that wrap around your waist
Your heart will pound even after the day has passed

Lalalalala Lalalala Lalalalala

Please give me that sweet taste, ice cream cake
With a flavor that fits this special day
The ice cream that’s on my mouth
Makes your heart pound and you’ll come to me
It’s so tasty come and chase me,

Gimme that, Gimme that Ice Cream

Pops, it’s melting in my mouth, Putting so much in
That it’ll feel like my mouth is melting down
Baby boy, other guys don’t know anything,
You’re so fine so only wear clothes
That don’t make you stand out
Never get me wrong my boo,
I have no interest in that bag
From boring Mon-Wed, Thurs Man I wanna pass
Your look toward me, I see some good vibes
It’s a good feeling when my eyes meet yours

Gimme That, Gimme That, Gimme That
Gimme That, Gimme That,
Gimme That Ice Cream

Hurry and give me that soft taste, ice cream cake

In my warm heart, ice cream cake

It’s so tasty, come and chase me
Your lips are sweetly melting, I’m closing my eyes

That sweet taste, ice cream cake
With a flavor that fits this special day
The ice cream that’s on my mouth
Makes your heart pound and you’ll come to me
