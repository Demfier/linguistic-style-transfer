Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river's going to flow
It just seems that upstream, I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

And that light, hits your eyes
I know, I swear we'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky

But that's alright, sometimes, sunlight comes streaming through the holes
Oooohhh ooooohh...
