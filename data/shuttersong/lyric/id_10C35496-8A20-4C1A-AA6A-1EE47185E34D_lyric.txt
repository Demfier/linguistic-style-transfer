There's a dark part of town where the girls get down
And I cannot wait for a chance to go, wait for a chance to go
I got my bad luck shoes and every excuse, to dance these blues away
Ain't comin home, I ain't comin home

Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court

In a dusty room I've come to assume
That I've been doomed to lose my mind tonight
Too weak to fight
So I tried to save face and I rest my case
The judge pulls me aside said c'est la vie
Let your darker side come out to feed

Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court

Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court

All rise, I can't do sexy (ha, ha, ha)

I commit the crime of wasting time
Always trying to rhyme
Yes, I am guilty
But don't misunderstand me
I admit defeat, then I move my feet
My history will never be repeated
I won't ever be repeated

Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court

Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It's a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
