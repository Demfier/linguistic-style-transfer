I drove for miles
just to find you
and find myself
all these screams
all these voices in my head
you gave me strength
gave me hope
for a lifetime

I never was satisfied
This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
Givin' up
This time won't you save me?

This time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up

Givin' up
Givin' up
It's not your fault
I'm a bitch
I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast
And I feast when I conquer

But I'm alone
On my throne
All these witches
I came this way
All this way
Just to say

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself givin' up

Givin' up
This time won't you save me?

This time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up
I'm givin' up baby
Yes...
I'm givin' up baby
(Feels like I've been driving for miles and I can't seem to silence these voices
in my head)
This time won't you save me?
Who save me?
This time won't you save me?
Who save me?
This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
Givin' up
This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
Givin'up
This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up
