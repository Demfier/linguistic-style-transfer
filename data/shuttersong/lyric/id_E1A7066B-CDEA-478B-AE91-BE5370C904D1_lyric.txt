We are young, we are gold.
Trying things we didn't know.
Looking at the sky.
See it come alive.

All our fears became our hopes.
Climbed out every locked window.
We fell out from the rain

We can reach the constellations.
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out.

No, we're never gonna turn to dust.
All we ever need is us.
Don't be scared or close your eyes.
No, we're never gonna die,
We'll be the stars.
Oh, no we're never gonna step too far.
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are.
When it's time to close our eyes,
They'll see us in the sky.
We'll be the stars Let me in, hold me close.
Fill my heart with simple notes.
So when it's hard to see,
They'll be there reminding me.

Take my breath, and hold me high,
So I can feel the city lights glowing under me
It's on our reach, we're breaking out.

No, we're never gonna turn to dust.
All we ever need is us.
Don't be scared or close your eyes.
No, we're never gonna die,
We'll be the stars.
Oh, no we're never gonna step too far.
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are.
When it's time to close our eyes,
They'll see us in the sky.
We'll be the stars We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out.

No, we're never gonna turn to dust.
All we ever need is us.
We'll be the stars.
Oh, no we're never gonna step too far.
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are.
When it's time to close our eyes,
They'll see us in the sky.
We'll be the stars
