Written by£ºThomas Brown/Victoria McCants/Steven Franks/Ariana Grande/Dwayne Carter
I just broke up with my ex
Now I'm out here single I don't really know what's next
But I ain't even trippin' I'm not jealous lay back
And I know they will be coming from the right and the left left left
I just broke up with my ex
You're the one I'm feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don't normally say this but goddamn you're the best best best
And if it feels right promise I don't mind
And if it feels right promise I'll stay here all night
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you you
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it boy it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you but goddamn I'm a mess mess mess
And if it feels right promise I don't mind
And if it feels right promise I'll stay here all night
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you you
