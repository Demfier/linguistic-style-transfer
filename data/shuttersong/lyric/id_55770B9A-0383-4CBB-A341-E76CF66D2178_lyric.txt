Snow was falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
Said that you'll be with me real soon

So I wait and I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

'Cause I got 5 more nights of sleeping on my own
4 more days until you're coming home
3 more dreams of you and mistletoe
2 more reasons why I love you so

I got 5 more nights until you're next to me
4 more days of being lonely
3 more wishes I can make and
If I could make it til Christmas Eve

Then it's one more sleep
One more sleep until it's Christmas
One more sleep
Can't believe how much I missed us
One more sleep
One more sleep until it's Christmas
One more sleep

Now I don't think I can remember
Cold and lonely the December
And I find myself sitting at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home

So I try (try)
And I try (try)
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time I got

'Cause I got 5 more nights of sleeping on my own
4 more days until you're coming home
3 more dreams of you and mistletoe
2 more reasons why I love you so

I got 5 more nights until you're next to me
4 more days of being lonely
3 more wishes I can make and
If I could make it til Christmas Eve

Then it's one more sleep
One more sleep until it's Christmas
One more sleep
Can't believe how much I missed us
One more sleep
One more sleep until it's Christmas
One more sleep

Until where I've been until Christmas Eve
Until I got to sleeping next to you
We've got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't think of missing you

5 more nights on my own
4 more days mhm
3 more dreams, mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go

5 more nights of sleeping on my own
4 more days until you're coming home
3 more wishes I can make and
If I could make it til Christmas Eve

Then it's one more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
