Hey Yo Cisco
Lets take em on a trip
Like we had a party and put shrooms in the dip
now I'm tripping
and girl won’t listen
when I tell her that I love her and
I really really miss her
Lets do it
Like we never did before
Lllllet’s
just lose control
I know you know what I know
Lllllet’s
just lose control
I’ve been drinkin
but I feel fine
I’ve been thinkin
you should be mine
for the weekend
or a long time
baby you could you could be my girl
you could be my girl
you could be my GIRL
and I could be your man
(you could be my)
you make my heartbeat stop like a beatbox
I try to pump it back up like some Reeboks
if love is a drug I need a detox
cuz you get me higher than the treetops
and i can see it all from here
got my head up in the clouds but its all so clear
hear my dear, take a look in the mirror
you’re lookin at the reason I'm a killer this year
I’ve been drinkin
but I feel fine
I’ve been thinking
you should be mine
for the weekend
or a long time
baby you could you could be my
GIRL
you could be my girl
you could be my GIRL and I could be your man
(you could be my)
will you be my senorita
real drunk love margarita
take a long walk by the seaside
working real hard for you to be my
you could be sunray on a summer day
you could be my sea spray
take my breath away
you could be everything girl
everything
and I could be your everything girl everything (everything)

I’ve been drinkin
but I feel fine
I’ve been thinking
you should be mine
for the weekend
or a long time
baby you could you could be my
GIRL
you could be my girl
you could be my GIRL and I could be your man
(you could be my)
