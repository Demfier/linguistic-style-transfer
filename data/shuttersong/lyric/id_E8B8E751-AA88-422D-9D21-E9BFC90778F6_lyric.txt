I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine-to-five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
And you never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you (miss you)
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

If you find a man that's worth a damn
And treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Yeah, \
