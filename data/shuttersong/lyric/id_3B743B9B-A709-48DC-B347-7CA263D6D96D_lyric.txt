I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it.
See I gave you faith and you doubt and it opened, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my choice turn them open
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?

*Instrumental Break* 

(Chorus)
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?


I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, would you say it?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh lord

(Chorus)
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you the most

*Instrumental Break*

Where are you now that i need ya?
Where are you now that i need ya?
Where are you now that i need ya?

I need you the most
