I ain't never met a girl like you
And you'll never find a man like me.
Walking out the door with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want.

Got me goin' mad
When you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap when you act like that (yeah)
I ain't even mad when you dress like that (Skate)
I know you know you bad when you act like that

Oh yeah

Met a bad bitty from the state of Mississippi
Really pretty and I wanna take her home to see the city
Doin' ya thing, Got me insane
Walk in the mall and you copping your chain
And I was like damn
You hot as a flame

Your mom's the only one that you can blame
You so cute, girl, yeah you is a blessing
And i'm the reason that your boyfriend keep flexing
Never stop texting every time I see ya name up in my phone
I'm just picturing your body in that dress and makeup on
You don't even need the makeup

Save that shit for later
You the baddest thing I seen, yeah I'm thanking your creator
Girl, I see you working like Miley Cyrus be twerking
I'm certain you'll be screamin' for me when I close the curtains
But it's funny, cause I'm the one screamin' out for ya baby
I've been messin' around with too many girls I need a lady


Hoping you could be the one but you needa show it
And if you prove it to me all this money girl we'll blow it

I ain't never met a girl like you
And you'll never find a man like me.
Walking out the door with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want.

Got me goin' mad when you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap when you act like that
I ain't even mad when you dress like that
I know you know you bad (okay) when you act like that (hah, get it)

Walked up in the spot we do this a lot
Livin' up at the top, attention you caught mine
Let's pop a bottle, good God, look at what we got
Double take like a stop sign
I thought I would be done with of all this stuff
But shit, I guess not
I'm tryin to get at you
Trust me I'm not yo' average individual
Yeah, I can slow it down
But I ain't talking about first
I know what you're worth
In my head I've already bought you a purse, and much more
And I got everything you need, just like the drugstore
Oh, and before you ask
Keepin' haters on off my nuts, yeah that's what the cuff's for
A bunch more
Chances are coming your way but I know that you'll take me
(It's crazy)
How people get lust n' love mixed up I'm beginnin' to daydream
And what we could be and the things we could do if you give me your time
But tonight, all that's on my mind is gettin to know you in making you mine
You're a dime,
Girl,
A straight ten,
Like holy moly, me oh my,
I don't even know where to begin.
And let's pretend that in this moment in time, we're more than friends,
And I recommend that you and I get familiar

I ain't never met a girl, like you
And you'll never find a man, like me.
Walking out the door with you on my arm,
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want

Got me goin' mad when you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap, when you act like that
I ain't even mad when you dress like that
I know you know you bad when you act like that
oh yeah
