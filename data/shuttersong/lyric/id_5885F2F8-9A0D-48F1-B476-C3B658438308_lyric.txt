Waking up on a Monday
Treatin¡¯ it like a Sunday
Mr. Sun¡¯s back and he¡¯s scratching your back for me
What a perfect way to be.
 
Wake you up from a nice dream
To take you out for an ice cream,
Spend the day on a ferris wheel by the sea
What a picture perfect way to
give me your heart,
I won¡¯t let go¡­
 
CHORUS*
I¡¯m hoping that someday, someday,
I¡¯m gonna put a smile on that pretty face
So someway, someway
We¡¯ll still be dancin¡¯when we¡¯re old and we¡¯re gray
But I¡¯m lookin¡¯ at you from the distance,
You don¡¯t know what you¡¯re missin¡¯, girl
Someday, someway
I know it¡¯s gonna be okay.
 
Oh, I know it¡¯s gonna be okay (oh)
 
Strollin¡¯ under the boardwalk,
Driftin¡¯ off to the sound of the band oh,
Nine o¡¯clock comes and nine o¡¯clock¡¯s gone away
Got a date at Ricks cafe,
Hold your hand in the back row
Steel a kiss in the shadows,
As time goes by
I know we will be a perfect love story
I gave you my heart, so don¡¯t let go¡­*
 
I¡¯m hoping that someday, someday,
I¡¯m gonna put a smile on that pretty face
So someway, someway
We¡¯ll still be dancin¡¯when we¡¯re old and we¡¯re gray
But I¡¯m lookin¡¯ at you from the distance,
You don¡¯t know what you¡¯re missin¡¯, girl
Someday, someway
I know it¡¯s gonna be okay.
 
Oh, I know it¡¯s gonna be okay (oh)
Oh, I know it¡¯s gonna be okay
But I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (oh)
I know
 
Give you my heart, so don¡¯t let go¡­*
I¡¯m hoping that someday, someday,
I¡¯m gonna put a smile on that pretty face
So someway, someway
We¡¯ll still be dancin¡¯when we¡¯re old and we¡¯re gray
But I¡¯m lookin¡¯ at you from the distance,
You don¡¯t know what you¡¯re missin¡¯, girl
Someday, someway
I know it¡¯s gonna be okay.
 
(Someway, someway) (oh) I know it¡¯s going to be okay
(Someday, someday) I know it¡¯s going to be okay
(Someway, someway) I know, I know, I know, I know
(Someday, someday) I know it¡¯s going to be okay.
 
The end
