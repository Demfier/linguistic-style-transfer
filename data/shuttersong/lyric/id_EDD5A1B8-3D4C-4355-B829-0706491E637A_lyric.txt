I Know What You Did Last Summer - Jacob Whitesides
Black sins, white lies
Cold hands in the midnight
Under the water, under the water
We make love
There was a blanket covering everything you never said
We were Atlantis, all of the sunken ships inside its veils
Under the water, under the water
We lost blood
I know what we did last summer
And you won¡¯t let me forget it
You won¡¯t let me forget it
I know what we did last summer
How you gonna do that to me?
How you¡¯re gonna do that to me?
You don¡¯t know what you did

Seashells all over my skin
Drifting from the island
Under the water, under the water
Can¡¯t see sea
Oh and I¡¯ll blow tequila, don¡¯t taste the same
Boy, you got me feeling some type of way
I¡¯m on an island so full of pain
Under the water
Stuck in the water, in vein
I know what we did last summer
And you won¡¯t let me forget it
You won¡¯t let me forget it
I know what we did last summer
How you gonna do that to me?
How you gonna do that to me?
I know what we did last summer
You won¡¯t let me forget it
No, you won¡¯t let me forget it
I know what we did last summer
How you gonna do that to me?
How you¡¯re gonna do that to me?
You know what you did
How you gonna do it baby, how you gonna do it baby?
I know what we did last summer
And you won¡¯t let me forget it
You won¡¯t let me forget it
I know what we did last summer
How you gonna do that to me?
How you gonna do that to me?
Black sins, white lies
Cold hands in the midnight
Under the water, under the water
We make love
