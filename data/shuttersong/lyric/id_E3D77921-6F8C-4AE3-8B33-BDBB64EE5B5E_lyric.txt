i was walking solo
no one was around, yeah
my thoughts were killing me
but i made no sound

while my life was fading
no one seemed to understand
i needed someone to save me
I couldn't save myself

Then I turned around
i saw your face
i heard your laugh
my life was saved

You held me up when i was falling
you put a smile on my face
I thought the darkness was forever
till the day you finally came
All these words I'm writing down
they can't explain how much I owe to you
you're my hero

now my life has colour
no more black and white
everything is brighter
no more faking smiles

I want you to see
how much my life has changed
Louis, you're my angel
you can't be replaced

You held me up when i was falling
you put a smile on my face
I thought the darkness was forever
till the day you finally came
All these words I'm writing down
they can't explain how much I owe to you
you're my hero

and even though you'll never know me
you've got the key to my heart
and even though you'll never know it
whenever you don't smile the sky turns grey

You held me up when i was falling
you put a smile on my face
I thought the darkness was forever
till the day you finally came
All these words I'm writing down
they can't explain how much I owe to you

You held me up when i was falling
you put a smile on my face
I thought the darkness was forever
till the day you finally came
All these words I'm writing down
they can't explain how much I owe to you

you're my hero
you're my hero
louis, my hero
