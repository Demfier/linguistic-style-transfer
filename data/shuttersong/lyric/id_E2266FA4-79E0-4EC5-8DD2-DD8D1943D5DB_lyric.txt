Never Let You Down - Frankie J
I'm never gonna let you go
I know you goin' through a lot things
But then I'm into keepin' you tight
'Cause in the true light 
'Cause I wanna do right
I can lead this thing
'Cause baby 
I ain't trippin' on the meaningless same game
Never let none test  one flesh
Niggas there by step 'til death
And we can get back up and we can ball
If we should fall  if we should fall
It's truly a blessing 
Come directly from Heaven
Through that from a resurrection
I'ma be right there by your side
Never let your down  never need to cry
Wipe your eye  eye  eye
Wipe your eye  eye  eye
Wipe your eye  eye  eye
Wipe your eye  eye  eye
