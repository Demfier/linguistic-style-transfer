"Kaleidoscope"

There was only ever you and me
And there was only ever history
Holding us back, holding us back

But that night, we stared in wonder
Wide-eyed but scared to wonder
The landslide fell silent all around

And it was the same scene from a kaleidoscope dream
You got me spinning, no no
You didn't wake me from my kaleidoscope dream
You got me spinning in your love

Do you remember when we used to see
White flamingos gliding on the breeze
And there was only ever you and me
In this neon jungle, you fed my hunger

That night, we stared in wonder
The black sky turned technicolor
And your eyes surprised me when you smiled

And it was the same scene from a kaleidoscope dream
You got me spinning, no no
You didn't wake me from my kaleidoscope dream
You got me spinning in your love

And you hypnotize me like no other
Mesmerize my mind in colors
So let the night bring us together again

And it was the same scene from a kaleidoscope dream
You got me spinning, no no
You didn't wake me from my kaleidoscope dream
You got me spinning in your love

And you hypnotize me like no other
Mesmerize my mind in colors
So let the night bring us together again
