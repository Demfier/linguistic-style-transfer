You've come around, you've come for more
I don't believe we've met before
Forget the day we saw the end
Just come and fall in love again

Here's where it starts
The same place, the same breaking hearts
And where it ends
We'll meet here and fall apart again

I'll stay a while to watch you sleep
The sun is fading and so are we
I'll stay a while to watch it end
Then break your heart to know I can

The first time that I learned I could make you cry
Was just like how I thought you looked inside
The last time will be one night of whispered lies
The last time that I'll pretend you could be mine
