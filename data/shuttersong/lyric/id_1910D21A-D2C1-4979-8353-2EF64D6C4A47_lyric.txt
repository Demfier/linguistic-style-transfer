We've got a bit of love-hate
You take me to the edge then you hit the brakes
I-I I say it's over one day
But then I'm crawling back begging you to stay

We make up and we break up all the time, hey

I'll say that I hate a song
Then you'll go request it the whole night long
So-some people say it's so wrong
But even when we fight, girl you turn me on

We make up and we break up all the time

We're like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we got it right
We go, na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Na, na, na (Na, na, na)

You wanna party too late
But when I do the same all you do is complain
You know that it drives me insane
But when I get with you girl you make it okay

We make up and we break up all the time

We're like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we got it right
We go, na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Na, na, na (Na, na, na)

Na, na, na (Oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
Na, na, na (Oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
It drives me mad, oh
Na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
We're like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always like na, na, na (Na, na, na)
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we got it right
We go, na, na, na
