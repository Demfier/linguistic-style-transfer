Stop me
Say you wanna stop me
Say you wanna stop me now
But I'm leaving
Yes I'm gonna leave you
Yes I'm gonna leave your life
If it's just 'sorry'
I don't want your sorry
I don't want your sorry now
Is too late, you know
Is too late you know
Wasted time
Say
Do you wanna play for love?
Do you wanna play for love?
Say
Do you wanna play for love?
Do you wanna play for love?
Your silence
Your silence
Your silence... ah aah
Silence
Your silence
Your silence
Wake me
Say you wanna wake me
Say you wanna wake my life
But I know you
Yes I wanna know you
Yes I wanna know your life
If is just teasing
I will be your teaser
I will be your teaser now
Is too late, you know
Is too late you know
Wasted time
Say,
Do you wanna play for love?
Do you wanna play for love?
Say,
Do you wanna play for love?
Do you wanna play for love?
Your silence
Your silence
Your silence... ah aah
Silence
Your silence
Your silence
Say, you wanna know me
You wanna know me
And try to let it out
And try to let it out
and try to let it out
