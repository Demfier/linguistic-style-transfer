You say, this is for eternity
Well, I'm so in love with this idea
If you believe we were meant to be
Let's celebrate all the love we feel

We know this is for eternity
Well, I think we got the right recipe
When we go out you can count me in (count me in)
We'll hit the road and you'll watch me spin
You show it off just to make me feel, make me see
When you do that, do it carefully
I got a gun and point at your heart (point at your heart)
And I am ready to shoot, so you better be smart

So take it slow
You won't need your arrow and bow
I will show how much I adore you
Wow, even more when you tear at my shirt
'Cause you know I'm in love from head to toe
So here we go
We can dance with no reason and laugh
Till we drop and then hit the next spot
Fall into love
We can bounce on the clouds till we fall (till we fall)

I got a million different tunes in my heart
And they are all for you
I got a million different tunes in my heart
And I am ready to show
Sealed with a kiss and a melody
And it is all for you
I got a million different tunes in my heart
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you

So take it slow
We can go with the flow
It's unknown where it ends
Will we ever come back?
Wow, just like that
I am trapped in your hands
It makes sense and I know that I won't let go
Yeah, yes we can
With a brand-new plan in our hands
We will dance and then conquer the world
Don't you ask, just confess
We are blessed with a love that will last (that will last)

I got a million different tunes in my heart
And they are all for you
I got a million different tunes in my heart
And I am ready to show
Sealed with a kiss and a melody
And it is all for you
I got a million different tunes in my heart
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
And they are all for you
