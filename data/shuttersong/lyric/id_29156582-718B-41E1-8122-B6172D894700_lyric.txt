Lullaby of birdland
That's what I
Always hear, when you sigh
Never in my wordland
could there be ways to repeal
in a phrase, how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtledoves
Bill and coo
when they love
that's the kind of magic music
we make with our lips
when we kiss

And there's a wheapy 'ol willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'll cry on my pillow
If you should tell me
farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland
whisper low
kiss me sweet, and we'll go
flying high in birdland,
high in the sky up above
all because we're in love
