Today I'm not myself
And you, you're someone else
And all these rules don't fit
And all that stars can quit

What a peculiar state we re in
What a peculiar state we re in

Let's play a game
Where all of the lives we lead
Can change
Let's play a game

Where nothing that we can see, the same
We'll find all the pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I can show you how many moves to check mate right now
We can take a part this life we re building
And pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we re doing it right now

Right now
