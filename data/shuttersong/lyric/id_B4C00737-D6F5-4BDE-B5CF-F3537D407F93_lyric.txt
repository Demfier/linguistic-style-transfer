"We Can't Stop"
(originally by Miley Cyrus)

Oooh oooh oooh

Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have fun now
Got somebody here might get some now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a Hell, no
'Cause we're gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright

So la da da di
We like to party
Dancing with Miley
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah

It's our party we can do what we want (oooh ooh)
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want

To my home girls here livin' it up
Feeling alive and are in love
Remember only God can judge ya
Forget the haters 'cause somebody loves ya
Everyone actin' like they know you
So fake actin' like they so cool
We all so turned up here
Getting turned up, yeah, yeah
