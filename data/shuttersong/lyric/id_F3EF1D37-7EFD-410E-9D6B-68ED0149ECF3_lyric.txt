I've been running from it all my lifetime
There's nothing wrong with you, I'm searching for my right mind
Oh
You should've seen it, they were resting on the restless
This happened, literally - woke up I was headless
I woke up I was headless

(Ah)
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a- I'ma make a bad wolf- I'ma, I'm a bad wolf,

I'ma make a bad wolf, I'ma, I'ma,
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
You're all still here

Motherfucker, I'll be back from the dead soon
I'll be watching from the center of the hollow moon
Oh

Oh my god, I think I might've made a mistake
Waiting patiently was waiting taking up space
We are waiting taking up space
(Ah)
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more

I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a- I'ma make a bad wolf- I'ma, I'm a bad wolf,
I'ma make a bad wolf, I'ma, I'ma,
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
¡°
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
¡ª AWOLNATION

The earth below is above my feet when the clock is laughing at me
When copy cats and the lazy brats are the last thing I want to see
No
My enemy is a friend of mine in a friendly place to be seen

Hey

You know I'll run away for a couple years just to prove I've never been free
They will never find me here
They will never find me here
They will never find me here
They will never find me here
Yeah
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
I'ma make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don't bite no more
