My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, you have found peace
You were searching for release

You gave it all into the call
You took a chance and
You took the fall for us

You came thoughtfully
Loved me faithfully
You taught me honor
You did it for me

Tonight you will sleep for good
You will wait for me, my love

Now I am strong, you gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am home

My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, look what you can do
I am mending, to be with you

You took my hand added a plan
Gave you my heart
Asked you to dance with me

You loved honestly
And loved me faithfully
You taught me honour
You did it for me

I know in peace you'll go
I hope we'll revenge yours
Now I am strong, you gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am home
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
(ooh oooh, ooohh, ooohh)
