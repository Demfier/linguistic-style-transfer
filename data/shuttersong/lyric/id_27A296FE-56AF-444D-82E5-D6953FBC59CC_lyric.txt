City's breaking down on a camel's back.

They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You wont get out the county, 'cos you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is my message beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no.

Windmill, Windmill for the land.

Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land

Is everybody in?
Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats

Lining them up-a like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
Its my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahahaa.
Yo, we gonna go ghost town
This motown
With yo sound
You're in the place
You can bite the dust, you can't fight with us
With yo sound, you kill the INC.
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar header.
Yo, watch the way I navigate
Hahahahahhaa

Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good
Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good
Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good

Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good
Windmill, Windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride

It is ticking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me

Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady

Watch me navigate
Ahahahahahhaa.
Don't stop, shit it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
Ahahahahahhaa.
Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good
Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good
Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good
Sh-shake it, shake it, Feel Good
Ahhhhahahahah
