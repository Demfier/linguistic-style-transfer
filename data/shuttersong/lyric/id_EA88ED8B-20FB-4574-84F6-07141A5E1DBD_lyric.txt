Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere

Hands in the air like we don't care
Because we came to have so much fun now
Got somebody here might get some now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a hell no?
Because we're going to go all night
Till we see the sunlight alright

Shaking it like we're in a strip club
Remember only God can judge us
Forget the haters because somebody loves you

And everyone in line in the bathroom
Trying to get a line in the bathroom

Getting turned up yeah
