We'll be passing by
And they'll be wasting time
Just waiting for new
And while they're chasing darks
We'll be dancing in the dusk
Guess a way coming through
Whenever you need me I'm behind
I promise to take you off to the height

(hmmmm)
Woo-hoo

Woo-hoo

We feel the burning up
And you're wasting all your luck
I'll be here for you, here for you
When the dark is at his bone
And you run away from hope
I'll be here for you, here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
You-hoo
you-hoo

I'm here for you
You-hoo

You-hoo
And while they're on the ground
We'll be looking down
Cause we found the truth
And the fire in our hearts

Will be blowing up the stars
Now we're coming through
Whenever you're feeling doubt inside

I promise to take you off to the height
I'm here for you
Noooo
And when you feel you've had enough
And you've wasted all your love
I'll be here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
You-hoo
You-hoo
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
You-hoo
You-hoo
