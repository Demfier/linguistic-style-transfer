I feel afraid, can't see ahead,
But on this road, I chose to tread
Follow my heart, go my own way,
A brand new start, a different day
Stand on the edge, I won't look down
And hope my wings will lift me off the ground

Dream out loud, let it show
Got my halo, so I'll let it glow
Dream out loud, colours bold,
Watch it unfold, push ahead and go
Dream out loud
(I got my halo, so I'm gonna let it glow)
Dream out loud
(I got my halo, so I'm gonna let it glow)

When skies are dark,
Can't see the blue,
I'll let my light carry me through
They tell me no, but I believe
If I let go, I'll be cheating on me

I close my eyes, and take a dive
'Cause I know that I will survive

Dream out loud, let it show
Got my halo, so I'll let it glow
Dream out loud, colours bold,
Watch it unfold, push ahead and go
Dream out loud

I've made up my mind
One step at a time
It may take long but that's alright
It's start with today, yesterday's gone
Here is where I belong
Dream out loud, dream out loud
dreaming
Dream out loud, just keep on
beliving
Dream out loud, dream out loud
dreaming
Dream out loud, just keep on

Dream out loud, colours bold,
Watch it unfold, push ahead and go
Dream out loud, let it show
Got my halo, so I'll let it glow
Dream out loud, colours bold,
Watch it unfold, push ahead and go
Dream out loud
(I got my halo, so I'm gonna let it glow)
Dream out loud
(I got my halo, so I'm gonna let it glow)
