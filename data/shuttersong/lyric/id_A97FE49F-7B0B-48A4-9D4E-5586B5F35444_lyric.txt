Na-na-na come on

Na-na-na come on

Na-na-na-na-na come on

Na-na-na come on, come on, come on

Na-na-na-na come on

Na-na-na come on

Na-na-na-na-na come on

Na-na-na come on, come on, come on

Na-na-na

 

It's so good being back (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Cause no way I'm turning back (Oh oh oh oh oh)

And now the pain is my pleasure

Cause nothing could measure (Oh oh oh)

 

Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Out the box, out the line (Oh oh oh oh oh)

The affliction of the feeling

Leaves me wanting more (Oh oh oh)

 

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

Sticks and stones may break my bones

But chains and whips excite me

 

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

Sticks and stones may break my bones

But chains and whips excite me

 

Na-na-na come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it

 

Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Out the box, out the line (Oh oh oh oh oh)

The affliction of the feeling

Leaves me wanting more (Oh oh oh)

 

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

Sticks and stones may break my bones

But chains and whips excite me

 

Na-na-na come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it

 

S-S-S

S-S-S

Ooohh

 

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me, oh, you turn me on

It's exactly what I've been yearning for, give it to me strong

And meet me in my boudoir with my body suit on-on-on

I like it, like it

 

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

Sticks and stones may break my bones

But chains and whips excite me

 

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

Sticks and stones may break my bones

But chains and whips excite me

 

Na-na-na come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on

I like it, like it
