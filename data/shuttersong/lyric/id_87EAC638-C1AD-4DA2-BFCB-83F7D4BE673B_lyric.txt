When I wake up
When I wake in the morning, I smile to myself like I'm thanking God.
Shit, no more folks like, "Jonathan, when you gonna grow up and get a job?"
Cause I made that job, no, Steve that job's kept me hungry and foolish.
It's the coolest, I'ma dive in like Kendrick and drink some rum in the pool, bitch.
Or beers on the roof. It's the workaholic in the magic sun.
'Til the esky is empty, shit, what's life if you ain't having fun?
So forget your age and those walls, I'm bursting through that maze.
On top of the tour bus in a teen wolf mask, surfing USA.
And we got that baggage packed, happy gas, gas of laughs.
Yes, I can dig it. So I joke like tom on a josh, baskin in these tours like a big kid.
It's my habitat, I can't leave the trees like an orangutan.
I'm a running on air anchorman and I never land like bangarang.

Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?

Yo, I'm acting a fool. No shame, I came, I shat in the pool.
Yeah, better pass that blunt. I'm bad about it ¨C you can ask my mom.
She'll tell ya, I'm psycho mate, my ideas make your light bulbs break.
I make it look so damn easy, when I rock that Borat mankini.
Fuck what they say, you don't miss your chance to eat chocolate cake,
With your hands, you rock a bubble beard while you're taking a bath
Where a simple fart still makes you laugh like..

Hahahaha, blurp blurp, hahaha. And then a big brown shark came.

Now I'm on the stage, acting up. Yelling "Bombs away" while I grab my nuts.
Still living it, like it's all a movie. Still killing shit on Call of Duty.
And I still think, I can move like "The Matrix", real shit.
Shroomin in Vegas, or when I play with my dogs.
Even right now while I'm making this song.
So how's about it? Let's laugh til there's power outage.
That's all that I have to say.
Fuck them all and don't act your age, I'm making pancakes.

Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?

They're always saying to me, they're always saying,
"Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?"
They're always saying to me, they're always saying,
"Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?"
They're always saying to me, they're always saying,
"Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?"
They're always saying to me, they're always saying,
"Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?"
