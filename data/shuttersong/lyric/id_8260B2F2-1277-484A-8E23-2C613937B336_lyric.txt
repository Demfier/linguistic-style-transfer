Blue Skies - Lady & Bird

Blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
Still those blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
I find you
I find you happy for today
I mind you
I mind you ever going to stay
Blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
Still those blue skies are in the middle of a winter storm
While your blue eyes are looking at me like before
I find you
I find you happy for today
I mind you
I mind you ever going to stay
Through the window of my neighbours
There are fallen leaves
In my pillow
There are feathers I will wait
Until the morning light
Watch me before I go
Go tonight
I find you
I find you happy for today
I mind you
There are feathers I will wait
Until the morning light
Watch me before I go
Go tonight
