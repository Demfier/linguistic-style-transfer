Running through the hip-hop beat youth shine-line
Silver in the sunlight, you light-up my cold heart
It feels like in the sun, the sun
We're running around, around like nothing else can matter in our life
Away, away, away, the sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be gone from my life
Yeah you'll be gone, it's as simple as a change of heart
I'm not gonna think about the future
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I don't really mind, I don't really mind at all

Slipping into the night love
It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you'll never notice me
All that I was thinking about was cleaning up my conscience

Lost in the memory as it shakes uá¹— the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was as simple as a change in your heart
Just as simple as a change of heart
I know now a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I know that a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I

I don't mind at all
A love like this won't last forever
A love like this
A love like this won't last forever
