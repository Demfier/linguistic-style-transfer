I'm drowning in the bottom of a bottle
Running from a man I swore I'd never be
No one ever has to face tomorrow
But I'm the one that has to face me

It's the demons I've created for myself
The tragic truth
It's hard for me to understand myself
So it has to be hard as hell for you! FOR YOU! (YOU!)

Are we born to be broken, sinners and thieves?
Someone tell the heavens I'M READY TO ESCAPE! (YOU!)
This is not what I wanted not what I need!
Take it all, tear it all, RIP IT ALL AWAY!

I can't say the Devil made me do it
I chose to be the one I am, the way I am today
I wish there was but there's no way around it
In the end I made the choice and will not die ashamed

It's the voices screaming in my head
The tragic truth
It's hard for me to understand myself
So it has to be hard as hell for you! YOU! (YOU!)

Are we born to be broken, sinners and thieves?
Someone tell the heavens I'M READY TO ESCAPE! (YOU!)
This is not what I wanted not what I need!
Take it all, tear it all, RIP IT ALL AWAY!
Take it all, tear it all, take it all, TEAR IT ALL AWAY!

(YOU!)
Are we born to be broken, sinners and thieves?
Someone tell the heavens I'M READY TO ESCAPE! (YOU!)
This is not what I wanted not what I need!

Take it all, tear it all, RIP IT ALL AWAY! (AWAY!)
Are we born to be broken, sinners and thieves?
Someone tell the heavens I'M READY TO ESCAPE! (YOU!)
This is not what I wanted not what I need!
Take it all, tear it all, RIP IT ALL AWAY! (Rip it all way)
Take it all, tear it all, RIP IT ALL, TEAR IT ALL! (Rip it all away)
Someone tell the heavens TO TAKE IT ALL, TEAR IT ALL AWAY!
