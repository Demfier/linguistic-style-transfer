What A Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong\n I see trees of green red roses too\n I see them bloom for me and you\n And I think to myself what a wonderful world\n I see skies of blue and clouds of white\n The bright blessed day the dark sacred night\n And I think to myself what a wonderful world\n The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky\n Are also on the faces of people going by\n I see friends shaking hands saying How do you do\n They're really saying I love you\n I hear babies cry I watch them grow\n They'll learn much more than I'll ever know\n And I think to myself what a wonderful world\n Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
