Saw her walking on the side of the road, on the sidewalk chalk from my balcony window
First sight she made me look twice, cause I never seen someone walk as light as the wind blows
I caught up to try and get your name, quickly wrote a love letter turned it into and airplane
You looked up and that was enough cause you let out other butterflies I couldn't be contained

Some dreams never do come true
Some love doesn't hit the target
I've been wishing about you
Darling I've been wishing my hardest

You've got me seeing stars, brighter than ever
Shining just like diamonds do
I know that in time it could be all ours, brighter than ever
Your love is such a dream come true
I know, I know, I know I need you
I know, I know, I know I need you

There's a love I've been keeping aside
And you're the missing puzzle piece I've been trying to find
Hey girl you got me learning to fly
Got me higher than a kite and I've been painting the sky

Some dreams never do come true
Some love doesn't hit the target
But my dreams are reality now, and you're the one I've been dreaming about

You've got me seeing stars brighter than ever
Shining just like diamonds do
I know that in time it could be all ours, brighter than ever
Your love is such a dream come true
I know, I know, I know I need you
I know, I know, I know I need you

Baby don't let go
You got me, you got me
Baby baby don't let go
You got me, you got me, you got me

You've got me seeing stars brighter than ever
Shining just like diamonds do
I know that in time it could be all ours, brighter than ever
Your love is such a dream come true
I know, I know, I know I need you
I know, I know, I know I need you
I know, I know, I know I need you
I know, I know, I know I need you
