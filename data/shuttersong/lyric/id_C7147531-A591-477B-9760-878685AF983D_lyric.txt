Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an armageddon plague (HEY!)
The shame, the ones who die without a name
There's a song sounding out of key
To a hymn called faith and misery (Hey!)
A plead, the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
There's a drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line (HEY!)
The line, the money's on the other side
Can I get another amen (AMEN!)
There's a rag wrapped around the score of men (HEY!)
A gag, A plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
"The representative from California has the floor"
Seek out to the president gasbag
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel tower
And criticize the government
Bang bang goes the broken glass man
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Triumph by fires, sinning buyers
Thats not a way that's meant for me
Thank god, check out we're going on a holiday
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday
