So is it true
I could speak for you
But they all wanna know girl if you one or two
3AM message read
Are you still up
Sounds like a loaded question
Just playing
Yup, look
Everybody wanna know if we together
Ladies playing full court press
But no pressure
Not a player not new to the game
On fire for ya spark the flame
These girls on point but none the "bae"
They want me girl but girl I want the 

Blue eyed dime from last night
Yeah the heart throb broad that caught my eye
Ooo girl you were all mine
If I don't have you now I just might
You're the red lipstick on my cheek
It's the same damn reason I can't sleep
Ooo girl you're my only
If I don't have you I might go wild

That moment when your girl text you goodnight
When it's barely past nine
Got me thinking she lying
I swear to god I'm not the jealous type
But tell me now girl if I'm waisting my time
Just tryna be the only one in your life
Been a minute since I met this chick restless she got me reckless and heck
It's like I'm breathless 
Hearts around her necklace but
But if I'm second I'll be gone in a second 
Just chalk it up as a lesson yeah
You'll be remembered as a

Blue eyed dime from last night
Yeah the heart throb broad that caught my eye
Ooo girl you were all mine
If I don't have you now I just might
You're the red lipstick on my cheek
It's the same damn reason I can't sleep
Ooo girl you're my only
If I don't have you I might go wild

Blue eyed dime from last night
Yeah the heart throb broad that caught my eye
Ooo girl you were all mine
If I don't have you now I just might
You're the red lipstick on my cheek
It's the same damn reason I can't sleep
Ooo girl you're my only
