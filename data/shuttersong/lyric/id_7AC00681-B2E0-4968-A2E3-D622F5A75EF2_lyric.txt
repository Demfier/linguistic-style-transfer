I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad
If I had to set the alarm
Cus those thrills that run up my back
You are my star
Nothing else could leave me off track
Hey, yeaaaah
You're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
You're innocence
Whose the brave
Drowning in
Would you save me?
It's a crime
If you don't
You're the spy
By the throat
