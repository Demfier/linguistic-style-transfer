Oh, hey!
Good day
I pretend like I'm ok
Crack a smile
I show my face
Hoping to just float away
I can picture sitting there in a silly chair
Please, just take me anywhere
Anywhere but here

Oh wait, too late
Destiny met me half way
It's great when fate cooperates
but I hate the way the citric tastes
Please, don't evaporate
'cause lately my awake feels faker than my dreams
I pray my maker helps me keep up with my fate

Staring at my face like stage fright
Daring me to break my brake lights
How can it be wrong if it feels right?

'Cause I'm looking at my Lifeline
And I'm ticking while the time flies
Yeah, I'm sipping on the lime light
All I know is that I won't let go
'Cause it's my Lifeline
'cause it's my Lifeline
'cause it's my Lifeline

Staring at my face like stage fright
Daring me to break my brake lights
How can it be wrong if it feels right?

'cause I'm looking at my Lifeline

And then I feel the wait and fate
To aggravate my mental state
I hesitate to compensate
'Cause at this rate I'll terminate
Did I underestimate?
Maybe I'll investigate
But replicate the things that I once knew

I can picture sitting there in a silly chair
Please, just take me anywhere
Anywhere but here

Contemplate about the things you celebrate
'Cause the secret is to change the game
before it changes you
Sing
Sing

Staring at my face like stage fright
Daring me to break my brake lights
How can it be wrong if it feels right?
'Cause I'm looking at my Lifeline
and I'm ticking when the time flies

Yeah, I'm slipping on the long line
All I know is that I won't let go
'Cause it's my Lifeline
(Yeaah)
It's my Lifeline
all i know is that I won't let go
'Cause it's my Lifeline
Blessed with a quest do I trust my questions
Searching with no guarantee
Dancing with answers and what is meant to be
And all I know is that i won't let go.
