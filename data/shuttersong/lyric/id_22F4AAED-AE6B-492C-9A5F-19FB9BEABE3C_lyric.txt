In this madness, in this world,
With its swiftness and its coldness
You’re my peace of mind, yes!
When the world just jeeps turning
And I know not where to head to
You’re peace of mind!
And when I look up in the skies
Is the one that you created...

Oh shining star, please look down for me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down at me
Beautiful star, do keep your eyes on me!
Oh, oh, what you are
When you look down on me?

It's about my greed when they chase me
when your heart strict 
do you love me?
I appreciate you baby!
And though you seem so far away
You pursuit me I can feel you
but did well within my mind
And I know you’re sometimes lonely
Oh, I wish that I could change it,
Oh then I know you still got me
And I pray my love will give you life
to help your breathe to give you smile
You’re my shining star, to take my love and live!

Oh shining star, please look down for me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down at me
Beautiful star, do keep your eyes on me!
Oh, oh, what you are
When you look down on me?

Where you smile I smile,
Where you live I live,
Where you die, I die!
Oh, yeah! You!
I’m a shining star, oh I wonder what you are?
