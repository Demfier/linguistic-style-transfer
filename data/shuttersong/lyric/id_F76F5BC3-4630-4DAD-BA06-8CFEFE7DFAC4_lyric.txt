(Chorus)
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

(Verse 1:)
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it
Globe trotter, hoe hopper, super star, ask direct ...
People always wonder so they ask us who we are
Pullin' up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar
Wanna be on top and tryna get there by tomar (tomorrow)
See, money, bitches love me, designer clothes foregin cars
But, I, ain't never gonna change different city everyday you hear these people scream my name
They think I'm underage, they don't know shit about the game
Till I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne
Living life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some \
