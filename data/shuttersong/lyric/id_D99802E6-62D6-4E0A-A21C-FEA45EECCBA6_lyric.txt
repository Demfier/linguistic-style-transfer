Hands
Put your empty hands in mine
And scars
Show me all the scars you hide
And hey, if your wings are broken
Please take mine so yours can open too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Oh, tears make kaleidoscopes in your eyes
And hurt, I know you're hurting, but so am I
And love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine so yours can open too

Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you

Love, you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
cause I'm gonna stand by you

Yeah, you're all I never knew I needed

And the heart, sometimes it's unclear why it's beating
And love, if your wings are broken
We can brave through those emotions too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you
And oh truth, I guess truth is what you believe in
And faith, I think faith is having a reason

And I know my love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine so yours can open too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna stand by you

I'll be your eyes 'till yours can't shine
And I'll be your arms, I'll be your steady satellite
Now when you can't rise
Well I'll cry with you on hands and knees
(Cause I) Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Love, you're not alone
I'm gonna stand by you
(Even if we can't find heaven, heaven, heaven)
Yeah, I'm gonna stand by you
