Prince of Peace - Hillsong United
My heart a storm
Clouds raging deep within
The prince of peace
Came burst into the wind
The violent sky held its breath
And in Your light I found rest
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The prince of peace met me there
You heard my prayer
Hope like the sun
Light piercing through the dark
The prince of peace
Came and broke into my heart
The violent cross
The empty grave
And in Your light I found grace
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The prince of peace met me there
You're always there
You heard my prayer
Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light
Will meet me there
When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my guard
When days breeds trouble
There You'll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know
Your peace will meet me there
Again and again and again and again
Oh be still my heart
I know that You are God
Oh fear no evil
For I know You
And my soul will know
Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light
Will meet me there
And my soul will know
When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my guard
When days breeds trouble
There You'll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know
Your peace will meet me there
Oh be still my heart
And my soul will ever know
That You are God
And heart my prayer
