(Justin Bieber)
Throwing up a G now
Like I'm at a casino.
I'm all fancy, yeah I'm popping Pellegrino.
I'm in the El Camino
When I pull up on the scene oh
You know I'm a real OG and baby I ain't from the TO
Messing with the clique ‘doe
Meet me on the sixth floor
Though you ain't a model you should let me take some pics though
Windows down, speakers loud
Look down at my sneakers now
Got so many features, tell the Christians just to beat it now
50 for that necklace
Looks down at my set list
Got your girlfriend at my crib watching Netflix
Let's just admit that I'm the bestest
Guess this, you ain't never ever on the guestlist

Order what you want, girl it ain't no problem
Imma tell the waitress that my baby need a bottle
Order what you want, said it ain't no problem
Got a piece of candy and it's all for you

She say she love my lolly, she wanna make it pop.
She say she love my lolly, she wanna kiss the top.
She say she love my lolly, she love my lollipop.
She say she love my lolly, she say she love my lolly

Girl I love those heels, and yeah I love that dress.
I want to take you home, and show you I'm the best

She say she love my lolly, she love my lollipop.
She say she love my lolly, she say she love my lolly.

(Juicy J)
Everywhere
Throw them dollars in the air
Bring you swimming, girl Juicy J the millionaire
She pop that pussy on her I fell back in the chair
Bands a make her dance
Molly make her lose them underwear
Booty cheeks, I'm geeked
All her friends are freaks
And I think she love me I've been hitting it for a week
I drill it, slap it silly be a super freak like Nicki
I'm Rick James bitch I slip myself a Mickey
Got so much money in my pocket
With a real bad chick finna drop it
With silicone racks and a real big ass
Make her bounce it like hydraulics
Kept it hard, I got purple on the plane
Less gullible, let's run a train.
She say she love my lolly, she wanna make it pop.
She say she love my lolly, she wanna kiss the top.
She say she love my lolly, she love my lollipop.
She say she love my lolly, she say she love my lolly
Girl I love those heels, and yeah I love that dress.
I want to take you home, and show you I'm the best
She say she love my lolly, she love my lollipop.
She say she love my lolly, she say she love my lolly.
