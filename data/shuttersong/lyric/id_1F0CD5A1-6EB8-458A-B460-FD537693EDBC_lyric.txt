It matters to me that you're on my side,
It matters to me that you're in my life
It matters to me

Why can't you see what
You mean to me
You're all that I wanted and hoped to be
You matter to me

And don't carry that grey cloud on your shoulders,
I'm waiting for you to see...

You matter to me and
I want you to know,
You're beautiful
And I won't let go
You're stronger each day
And you matter to me
You matter to me
Don't let all those words
Make you believe that you have no worth
Just remember that you always matter

When you always feel like
you're by yourself
And wanna reach out for someone else
Just know that you matter
If you're living too fast
And can't take it slow
Missing the moments that matter the most
Then matter them matter

And don't carry that grey cloud on your shoulders,
I'm waiting for you to see...

You matter to me and
I want you to know,
You're beautiful
And I won't let go
You're stronger each day
And you matter to me
You matter to me
Don't let all those words
Make you believe that you have no worth
Just remember that you always matter

And I'll carry your weight upon my shoulders
To help you finally see

You matter to me and
I want you to know,
You're beautiful
And I won't let go
You're stronger each day
And you matter to me
You matter to me
Don't let all those words
Make you believe that you have no worth
Just remember that you always matter

Because it matters to me
