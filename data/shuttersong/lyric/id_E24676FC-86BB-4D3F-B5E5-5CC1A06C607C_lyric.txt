I got eyes in the back of my head
Your halo is turning red
Fooling around
Knocking me off my cloud

You're talking about your mischievous ways
Boy it's painted all over your face
Stealing a kiss
Mysterious whispers
A thorn in my pride
I'm still by your side

But one day
I'm walking away
The tide is gonna turn
I'm gonna find my place
Give me
A reason to stay
I want to be your lover
Baby but you can't behave

Remember the days
And the hollywood nights
What happened to paradise
Stolen away
Knocking a place in now
Cause rumors are flying
That I can't avoid
Are they true
Or am I paranoid
Living like this
Is driving me crazy
So make up your mind
You're running out of time

Cause one day
I'm walking away
The tide is gonna turn
I'm gonna find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be your lover
Baby but you can't behave

Aho
Ease all of my worries
And please don't make me play the fool
Aho
Baby don't won't cha hurry
You don't know what you're gonna lose

Cause one day
I'm walking away
The tide is gonna turn
I'm gonna find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be your lover
Baby but you can't be

One day I'm walking away
The tide is gonna turn
I'm gonna find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be your lover
Baby but you can't behave

Oh baby but you can't behave
Oh baby but you can't behave
