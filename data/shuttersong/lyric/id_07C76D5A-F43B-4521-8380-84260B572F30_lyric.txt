Takin it slow
Isn't easy if as far as you go
It's only half as far as you and I, both
No yeah

Comin out from above
A little something
And it's only because
I don't ever wanna see you in love

But I know
That you been coming off strong lately
And I can feel it that
You've been thinking that I maybe

You gotta, another shot at me
Thinking possibly
Somehow but, not now
And it's been spinning around like a hurricane

And the sound of the thunder
That's beatin my head to the ground
But I
I know
That I can't go back
To this
To her
To what we used to have

It's black and burns

My god this is so, sad and it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back
And I mean if you believe
That there is something still between you and me

And baby honestly, yeah
You're not the one for me
And I can't go back
To this
To her
To what we used to have
It's black and burns
My god this is so sad and it only makes things worse
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
