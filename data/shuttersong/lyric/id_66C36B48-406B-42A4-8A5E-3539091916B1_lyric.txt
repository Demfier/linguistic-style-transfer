You're stuck in my head
Stuck in my heart
Stuck in my body body
I wanna go get out of here
I'm sick of the party party
I run away I run away with you
I guess this is the part
You gotta say all that you're feeling feeling
Thinking it back even tonight while everyone's sleeping sleeping
Let's run away
I know my way with you
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Baby take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go our
Run away with me run away with me
Baby every single limit
I'll be your hero in winning
When the lights go out
Run away with me run away with me
Up in the clouds
High as a kite
Over the city city
You never sleep you never drive
When you are with me with me
I wanna stay I wanna stay with you
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Baby take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go our
Run away with me run away with me
Baby every single limit
I'll be your hero in winning
When the lights go out
Run away with me run away with me
Hold on to me
I never wanna let you go
Run away with me run away with me
Over the weekend we can turn the world to gold
Run away with me run away with me
Turn the lights tonight
Over the weekend we can turn the world to gold
My baby take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go our
Run away with me run away with me
Baby every single limit
I'll be your hero in winning
When the lights go out
Run away with me run away with me
Run away with me run away with me
Run away with me run away with me
