The waves are warm, the sun is out
The sea is full of ancients
Take all the space between the grains of sand
And automate it

There is someone here who laughs too hard at everything
There is someone here who laughs too hard at everything
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out

The ride to land the mating crowds
Are out here for the weekend
We had to take our clothes before
The sun was gone completely
I used to like picking clouds
Deciding queens and which were doves
The lines I throw myself are thin
Are shower curtain thin

There is someone here who laughs too hard at everything
There is someone here who laughs too hard at everything
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out

You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out

You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn't it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
