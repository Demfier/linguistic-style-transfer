Shorty said she wants to run away
Says I look like a boy she used to date
Took me by the hand and pulled me to the stairs (Not interested, girl)
Put her tongue all up in my ear (Gross)
Almost made me spill my beer (Oh shit!)
She's up and ready to go but I don't care (Pssh, whatever)

Cause I'm in the zone
Turned off my phone
I've got my own agenda

I feel like dancing tonight
I'm gonna party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare
Cause I feel like dancing tonight

Everybody gettin' kinda crunk
I think some dude just grabbed my junk (Whoa)
Now I know how Ke$ha must be feelin' (Like, what if we are the aliens?)
Bros tried to turn me upside down
I put a keg tap to my mouth
But that's okay
I'm dancing on the ceiling (Ahhh)

Cause I've got the groove
I'll bust a move
Just try and stop me

I feel like dancing tonight
I'm gonna party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare
Cause I feel like dancing tonight

Somebody call the police (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I think they're coming to get me
They said
