One night only
This is forever
You so fly walking by
Ready
What the fuck was that?
Rainbow road
Ah, living life for the next drop
New style
Night after night
Lets go!
Disconnected
The truth
I'll follow you to the end
Right there, in front of you
I was right there, waiting for you
To see the sign
And recognise
What the rest of your life looks like
Ready set go! (Looks like)
Bassline kicking, yes im grooving
Oh yeah yeah
It's calling us
Biggest thing!
Take a trip to my house
Look at the sky
Rainbow road
This is forever
Night after night
Lets go
Then we collide
Rainbow road
Truth
Hello
This is RAZOR SHARP
Hold on
I'll never surrender
And our love is strong
This is forever
Are You Ready!
Make the ground shake!
I'm killin' it
