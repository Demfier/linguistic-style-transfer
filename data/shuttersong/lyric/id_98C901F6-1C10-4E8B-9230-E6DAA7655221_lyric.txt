We're coming out for you

Started out in the spring of 2003,
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
‘Except to tell me all the things I couldn't do
Don't wanna hear about it!
Got with my guys, packed into our cars,
Hit all the nearest scenes, and every local bar,
And played a show a night ‘til it'd make me sick.

So here I am, I'm right back at it again!
Just like I've always said:
