Blue

Always tryin' to be together alone
Waitin' for your eyes to open but they don't

It's all you
You're all around me
It's all you
You're all around me

Blue

Every day I hear you talking without words
Every day I see you dancing in reverse

It's all you
You're all around me
It's all you
You're all around me

Blue
Blue
Blue
Blue, Blue

Ooh ooh [x8]

Always tryin' to be together alone
Waitin' for your eyes to open they don't

It's all you
You're all around me
It's all you
You're all around me

Blue
Blue
Blue
Blue, Blue

Ooh ooh [x14]
Blue
