so many days
a million ways
i thought id break
that pretty girls with pretty legs
would fill the empty space
i know people say
that feelings fade
never seems to change
but nothing keeps the thoughts of you away
thats why...
theres somebody sneaking out my bedroom door
picking all her clothes up off my bedroom floor
a temporary fix to what i can't ignore
she's just a new high
so i can fly over you
another night
another date
another useless charade
but its alright
because she'll stay
and keep the ghost of you away
they say
give it space
sit and wait
but nothing seems to change
cuz i still think about you everyday
thats why...
theres somebody sneaking out my bedroom door
picking all her clothes up off my bedroom floor
a temporary fix to what i can't ignore
she's just a new high
so i can fly over you
no don't wanna be lonely lonely lonely x3
