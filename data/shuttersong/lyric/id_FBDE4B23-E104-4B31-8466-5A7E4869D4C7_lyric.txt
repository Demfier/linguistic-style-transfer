Get back on track,

 

pick me ups and bottles of booze

A fickle freshman,

probably thinks she's cooler than you

A hay ride, a fire,

everybody's coming around

So go press your skirt,

'cause word is there's a new girl in town

.

I call shotgun,

The fellowship time,

it always comes a little too soon

The land of the creeps,

freshened up and baby faced shaved

But your eyes on me,

and I know a place where we can get away

.

Just say I want you, just exactly like I used to

'Cause baby this is only bringing me down

.

Homeboy's so proud, he finally got the video proof

The night vision shows she was only ducking the truth

It's heavy I know, the black cat with the gift down below

A choke and a gag, she spit up and came back for more

.

And said I want you, just exactly like I used to

And baby this is only bringing me down

She said I want you

I want you, just exactly like I used to

And baby this is only bringing me down

I said I want you, just exactly like I used to

And baby this is only bringing me down
