When the daylight's gone, & you're on your own
And you need a friend, just to be around
I will comfort you, I will take your hand
And I'll pull you through, I will understand
And you know that...

I'll be at your side
There's no need to worry
Together, we'll survive
Through the haste & hurry
I'll be at your side, when you feel like you're alone
And you've nowhere to turn
I'll be at your side

If life's standing still, and your soul's confused
And you cannot find what road to choose
If you make mistakes (make mistakes)
You can't let me down (let me down)
I will still believe (still believe)
I will turn around
And you know that

I'll be at your side
There's no need to worry
Together we'll survive
Through the haste & hurry
I'll be at your side
If you feel like you're alone
And you've nowhere to turn
I'll be at your side

I'll be at your side
I'll be at your side

I'll be at your side
There's no need to worry
Together we'll survive
Through the haste & hurry
I'll be at your side, if you feel like you're alone
You've got somewhere to go
'coz I'm at your side
Oh, I'm at your side
Yeeeah, I'll be right
I'll be at your side
I'll be right there
