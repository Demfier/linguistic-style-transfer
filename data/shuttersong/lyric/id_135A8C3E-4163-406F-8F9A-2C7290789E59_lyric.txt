When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up

This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up

She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
E, e, everybody know that face

Even with her head low, they still know that shape
When she come through the club people take their place
Chicks throwin' handcuffs
'Cause they knowin' their man ain't safe
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows

If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, 'What kinda jeans is those?'
And fellas watchin' like, 'Please get low'

E, e, everybody can't do this

Some ain't gotta clue 'til they hear me spit
Ah chu I spew 'cause yo girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips you can't tell, but you know it's thick
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows

For this type of girl it's not that hard
You see her cause she's too far gone
They only prayin', pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin' what it do, fit to be a plus
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
