On and on and on
We gon do this all night long
On and on and on
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
On and on and on
I'm gonna carry on
On and on and on
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
I was a liar
I gave into the fire
I know I sould've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
Cause you don't want a liar
Day drunk into the night
Wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears
Yeah summer love and then fights
How it is for us
And it's all because
Now if we're talking body
I want the time of my life
One last time
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
So put it on me
Give me the time of my life
One last time
I wanna run away
You and me
On the same course
I wanna run away
Run away for a few days
I was runnin' through the six
With my woes
Anywhere out this place
Run away with me
Run away with me
I wanna run away
Baby won't you come my way
Runnin' through the six
With my woes
Wearing nothing but a smile
Fell to the floor
And you whisper in my ear
Baby, I'm yours
Ooh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high
Oh my, my
Looking like a good, good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my, my
you with a brand new high
Don't be shy
I just wanna live tonight
Live a little
First let me hop out the
Porsche
You used to call me on my cell phone
Sugar
Yes please
Won't you come
And put it down on me?
I'm right here
Cause I need
Little love
A little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness
In my life
Sugar
Yes please
Won't you come
And put it down on me?
I want you to know
Soon as you came in the door
You stole my heart
Because you're beautiful
I want you to know
I ain't never letting go
So darling hold my hand
Don't let me go
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Sugar
Yes please
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Just wanna dance all night
Til' it hurts
Shut up and dance with me
I wanna run away
You and me
On the same course
I wanna run away
Run away for a few days
I was runnin' through the six
With my woes
Anywhere out this place
Run away with me
Run away with me
I wanna run away
