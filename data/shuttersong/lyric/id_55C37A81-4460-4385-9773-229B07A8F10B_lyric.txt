It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
 
Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
 
Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
Cuz it's always a good time
 
Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time
 
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.
 
Feet down dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
Cuz it's always a good time
 
Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright we don't even have to try
It's always a good time.
 
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.
 
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.
 
Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Doesn't matter where
Doesn't matter when,
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.
