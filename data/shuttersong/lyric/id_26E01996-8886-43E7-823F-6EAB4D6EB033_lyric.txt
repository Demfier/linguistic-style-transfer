When you wake up, call a cab
'cause we ain't tellin anybody 'bout us yet.
And you want, all of it
but you aint even got the guts to tell your friends.

I want your lips, in public
but we both know the world aint ready for that yet.
So take my hand, in secret
take my heart and put it in your pocket.

I want the limelight with you.
Want the world to see you're mine.
We shine like diamonds in the view
Take the world on for your ride

I want the limelight with you.
We shine like diamonds in the view
I want the limelight with you.

We make love, in darkness
not even windows show what we won't confess.
Shedding off, our midnight skin
but I still feel your touch upon my fingertips
You say my name, you keep me safe
but only when you know no one could hear a thing.
So whisper please, make promises
and tell me that one day I'm gonna be a Queen

I want the limelight with you.
Want the world to see you're mine.
We shine like diamonds in the view.
Take the world on for your ride
I want the limelight with you.
We shine like diamonds in the view.
I want the limelight with you.
