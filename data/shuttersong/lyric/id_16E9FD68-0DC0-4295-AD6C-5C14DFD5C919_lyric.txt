Baby when they look up at the sky
We'll be shootin' stars just passin' by
You'll be comin' home with me tonight
We'll be burnin' up like neon lights

Please still, my heart cuz it's freakin' out
It's freaking out
Right now
Shining like stars cuz we're beautiful
We're beautiful
Right now

You're all I see in all these places
You're all I see in all these faces
So let's pretend we're running out of time
Of time!

Baby when they look up at the sky
We'll be shootin' stars just passin' by
You'll be comin' home with me tonight
And we'll be burnin' up like neon lights
