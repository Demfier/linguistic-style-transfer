Blessings
Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed (I)
(Straight up, look)

I live the life I deserve, bless
Fucken a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd
And Eddy, who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you \
