Sunday morning and cold rain is pouring down that's ok
I got sunshine next to me, yeah
We're out of coffee all we got is cereal, but that's alright
Cause I'm sharin it with you
We jump in my 96 corolla roam the streets of Beverly Hills

Windows down, your hair just blowing free
We ain't got no money baby, I don't mind
We feel like billionaires all I need is right here next to me

You make every day feel like, another day in paradise

It's true beautiful in every way
And I don't care what we do everything feels good with you
It's true, you make an ordinary day

Extraordinary
Extraordinary

Is what you are to me
Is what you are to me
Extraordinary

Extraordinary
Is what you are to me
Is what you are to me

Let's go to the park and walk and talk about nothin
It's alright cause it's all said anyway
Let's go home watch TV, make love, fall a sleep and tomorrow we'll do it all again.
You make everyday feel like another day in paradise
It's true you will fall in every way
And I don't care what we do, everything feels good with you
It's true you make an ordinary day
