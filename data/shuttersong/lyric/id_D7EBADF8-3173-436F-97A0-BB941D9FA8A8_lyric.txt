You used to paint me pictures
All alone we would sit by the lake
You never wasted a moment
You telling me just what you think
And all this changed
You were never what you claimed
How can you stand to fake it
When you know its my heart you're breaking
You left me that day, I needed to go
And how can you stand to chance it
When you know its my soul you wrecked it
I'm leaving you now, you'll know when I'm gone
I said I would, I meant it
I wanted to move to LA
But this is your home
You wanted to stay
We never talked about it ending
Only our future
You said this was our time,
To just hold on
and maybe I held to long
How can you stand to fake it
When you know its my heart you're breaking
You left me that day, I needed to go
And how can you stand to chance it
When you know its my soul you wrecked it
I'm leaving you now, you'll know when I'm gone
I said I would, I meant it

And what were you thinking
I never thought this would be us,
I still miss you.
Yeahhh
And ohhhh
Yeaaaaaah
How can you stand to fake it
When you know its my heart you're breaking
You left me that day, I needed to go
And how can you stand to chance it
When you know its my soul you wrecked it
I'm leaving you now, you'll know when I'm gone
I said I would, I meant it
