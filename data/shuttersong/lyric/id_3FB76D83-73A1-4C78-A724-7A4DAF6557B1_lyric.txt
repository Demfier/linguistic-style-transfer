I just bought some drugs,
Off a man that didn't know,
In the lobby,
The lobby of the Rosenfelt,
As if you didn't warn me enough,

I got that Califormula,
Got that Califormula,
One more night,
I got that Califormula,
No use in thinkin' bout it now
Cuz you're gone, you're gone,
You're gone,
So I leave it all behind,
I always feel like I'm behind you,
I tried to sleep it off,
I'm faded out my mind,
Lay me down tonight,

I always feel like I'm beside ya,

I got that Califormula,
Got that Califormula,

One more night,
I got that Califormula,

One more night,
Got that Califormula,
Thinkin bout you now,
You now, you now,
Where are you,
Where are you goin,
You're gone,
You're gone,
You're gone,
You're gone,
You're gone,
Gone,
Gone,
You're gone,
Gone
