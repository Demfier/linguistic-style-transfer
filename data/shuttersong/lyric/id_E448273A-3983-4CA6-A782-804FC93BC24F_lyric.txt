Drown me in my daily cup of tea,
Tell the porcupines to quit stabbing me,
They make me fall, but I will stand,
'Cause all of them are jerks with their cups in their hands.
Now they want a whisper, a whisper from me,
'Cause all of them have watched me on their big screen tv's
But what about little, little ol' me,
The one who got bullied, because of her teeth.

I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise,
To the bullies in the school yard, I know I'm on your mind,
Now you say love me, but what about before,
When I was just that silly little girl next door.
Oh oh
Ohhhohh

Ladies o' ladies, why are you so mad, is it
Cause I'm classy,
And you're trash bag
You teasing and laughing resonates through my heart
And now you're calling me 'cause you want a fresh start

Now look at you boys you cant believe your eyes,
You told me I was ugly and I took you by surprise,
You should of been nicer cause look where I'm at,
While you copy Mac Miller wearin' snap back hats.

I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise,
To the bullies in the school yard I know I'm on your mind,
Now you say love me, but what about before,
When I was just that silly little girl next door.
Oh oh
Ohhhohh

Why must you be so mean, talking trash about me...

All I wanted was a friend to laugh and cry and spend all of eternity
Or even just a week...

I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise,
To the bullies in the school yard I know I'm on your mind,
Now you say love me, but what about before,
When I was just that silly little girl next door.
Ohh...
