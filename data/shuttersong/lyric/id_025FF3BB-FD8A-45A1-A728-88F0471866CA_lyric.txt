Back at school
They all thought I was an outcast car crash
Hopeless fool, they said to me
And my girlfriend said I messed up
Will I ever grow up
In the end, I'm not gonna

What was I thinking
Everyone sees it
It's not a secret that I'm just a reject
Sick of the system, don't wanna feel it
It's not a secret that I'm just a reject
I'm just a reject

My teacher said I was mentally disabled
So unstable
So I'll stay in bed, all day
Save your breath
You can talk at me but I'm not listening
If this is a test
Then I'm probably failing

What was I thinking
Everyone sees it
It's not a secret that I'm just a reject
Sick of the system, don't wanna feel it
It's not a secret that I'm just a reject

They try to save me but I'm too far gone
And they call me crazy so I played along
And they want to change me but I'm on my own

Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da

What was I thinking
Everyone sees it
It's not a secret that I'm just a reject
Sick of the system, don't wanna feel it
It's not a secret that I'm just a reject
I'm just a reject
I'm just a reject
