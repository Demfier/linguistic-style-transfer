 secrets 
Oh won't you stay for awhile 
Show me goggles baby 
Show me deep inside 
Oh won't you stay for awhile 
I'll take you on a ride

Oh won't you stay for awhile 
Show me goggles baby 
Show me deep inside 
Oh won't you stay for awhile 
I'll take you on a ride 
If you can keep our  secrets 
Stay awhile 
Stay awhile and 
I'll make it worth your wild 
Worth your wild 
Stay awhile 
Stay awhile and I'll go the extra mile 
Extra mile

I got some drinks that'll help scream right now 
So stay awhile 
Stay awhile and I'll make it worth your wild 
Worth your wild 
Oh won't you stay for awhile 
Oh won't you stay for awhile 
I'll take you on a ride 
If you can keep our  secrets
