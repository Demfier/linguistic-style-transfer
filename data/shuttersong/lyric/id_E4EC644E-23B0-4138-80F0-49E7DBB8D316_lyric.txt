Can I sing to you bout Mr. Temboa and what he's got to do
But first I'm going back to the could weal floud
To find the mission that help me with his lost

Mr. Tembo's on his way on the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he plan

Can I sing to you bout Mr. Temboa and what he's going though
Up the enfatic night he chekc him on his own
Up the camazi and then made it his home

Mr. Tembo's on his way on the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he plan
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he plan

We all sing for you 'bout Mr. Tembo and what he's got to do
He get's up early while you are still in bed
Mr. Tembo great blanket by his head

Mr. Tembo's on his way on the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he plan
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he plan

Mr. Tembo's on his way on the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he plan
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he plan
