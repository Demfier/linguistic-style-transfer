"If you're feeling low then give it a go! Try Lambert's Sniffing Salts today"

You know when you're doing a song about a small town
You gotta start it with a cliche, you know what I'm sayin'

Time moves a little slower here
The paint peels 'cause the summers here are so severe
And we're nowhere near no where you would know of
Locals here pride, they show up just to show off
Four men take a load off, just to watch the day go by
Philosophizing with their friends like they're Plato
They prophecize on the bench by the main road, right
They got advice; I'm like "Ayo, if you say so guys."
But what do they know, Fox News got 'em lit
They're shockers, fundamentalists, the new communists
A girl with a shopping list, clutch her handbag close
I'm like "damn man" then it's all backhands, jokes
'Cause I'm a gentlemen, but then again most of us are
First name basis in the bank, the post-office, the bar
The grocery, parks, hey lady I ain't tryna grab your pension
The old men on the bench hum

"Direct from the transistor radio in your lounge room. It's the entertainment that the whole family can enjoy."
"Well I say looking slick will do the trick so try Barry's Brylcreem cream today!"

[Montaigne & Suffa:]
Well lets go, lets go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
"What a time to be alive"
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the cold war
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold of '55.

Time moves a little slower here
A day feels like a week, a weekend feels like it could go a year
And we're nowhere near nothing, man it's so true
I don't tell 'em where I'm from, I tell 'em where I'm close to
And I can go through an Atlas and show you on a map but
You'd still look me sideways and treat me like I'm backwards
But that's just fine, it so happens I'm
Happy living in a city that is trapped in time
While you're lined up in traffic I'm
Not panicked 'bout transit, I'm back in time
For a TV dinner and an early night
'Cause we get dressed to travel, got an early flight
Been doing laps of the earth while doing laps of the sun
Tryna put where I'm at on the map 'cause where I'm from
Would never get a mention, but all that and then some
Once again the old men on the bench hum

"And across the country they came in waves. Thousands upon thousands of flying discs descending from the planet Mars."
"For the closest shave try a Wilson's razor today."

[Montaigne & Suffa:]
Well lets go, lets go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
"What a time to be alive"
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the cold war
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold of '55

[Montaigne:]
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home

"The dieting revolution taking the world by storm."

[Montaigne & Suffa:]
Well Montaigne lets go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
"What a time to be alive"
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the cold war
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold of '55
