All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angles prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him lord of all
Ye chosen seed of Israel's race
Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail him saves You by his grace
And crown Him lord of all
Hail Him who saves you by his grace
And crown Him lord of all
You are lord of all
You are lord of all
Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him lord of all
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him lord of all
And crown Him lord of all
And crown Him lord of all
