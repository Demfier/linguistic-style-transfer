"Keep Me Dreaming"

I've walked these streets of silence

Through the cold and misty nights
But the more I search the less I tend to notice
I've been trying to find an answer
Why you left me high and dry
Even though your gone and need a sense of closer

Through all the times you've left and said it wouldn't be alone
Through all the times I'd wait for you to never come home
I won't back down
I won't back down
I won't back down so come right back to me

As I gazed out at Manhattan
From the peak of Brooklyn bridge
I could swear I saw an angel in the skyline
And she came and stood beside me
As the snow began to fall
Saying times will change but truth will stay forever

Through all the times you've left and said it wouldn't be alone
Through all the times I'd wait for you to never come home
I won't back down
I won't back down
I won't back down so come right back to me

I've lost your heart
To fall in stars
That keep me dreaming
I've lost your heart
To fall in stars
That keep me dreaming
I've lost your heart
To fall in stars
That keep me dreaming
Yeah, yeah

Through all the times you left and said it wouldn't be alone
I won't back down
I won't back down

Through all the times you've left and said it wouldn't be alone
Through all the times I'd wait for you to never come home
I won't back down
I won't back down
I won't back down so come right back to me
