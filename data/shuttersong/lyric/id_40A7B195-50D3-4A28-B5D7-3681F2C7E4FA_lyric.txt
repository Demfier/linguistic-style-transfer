Theres no way to say this songs about someone else
Every time you're not in my arms
I start to lose myself
Someone please pass me my shade
Don't let them see me down
You have taken over my days
So tonight i'm going out

Yeah im feeling like
There is no better place than right by your side.
I had a little taste
And im always for the party anywhere
Cause all the girls are looking fine

But your the only one on my mind

La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
Theres only me
Theres only you
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
When you're gone
Ill think of you
All these places packed with people

But your face is all i see
And the musics way to loud

But your voice wont let me be.
So many pretty girls around
They're just dressing to impress
but the thought of you alone
Has got me smiling

I dont know what to say next
Yeah im feeling like
there is no better place than

right by your side
I had a little taste

Now im always for the party anywhere
Cause all the girls are looking fine
but your the only one on my mind
La la da doo

La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
Theres only me
Theres only you
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
When you are gone

Ill think of you
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo

Theres only me
Theres only you
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
When you are gone
Ill think of you
Ill pretend the night is so beautiful

Take a photo with the bros
La da da doo
They won't see through my disguise
Right here behind my eyes
Replaying in my mind
La dee da

YEAH

Im feeling like
there is no better place than
right by your side
I had a little taste
Now im always for the party anywhere
Cause all the girls are looking fine

but your the only one on my mind

La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
Theres only me
Theres only you

La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
When you are gone
I'll think of you
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
Theres only me
Theres only you
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La la da doo
When you are gone
I'll think of you
