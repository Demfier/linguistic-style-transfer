The only time I feel good falling
Is when I'm falling fast and hard for
You
The last two digits when I'm calling
Fade away but somehow I'll get through
The only time I feel good sinking
Is when I'm sinking fast and deep for
You
You caught me as I was winking
Now I think my winking days are through
Could it be another chang?
To come and rearrange
Why can't she just feel the way I do?
You can't love no one
You can't love something
You can't love nothing
You can't love anything
Till you can love yourself
Till you can love yourself
You can love yourself
The only time I feel good falling
Is when I'm falling fast and hard for
You
I can't tell if you are stalling
So if you are please tell me what to do
The only time I feel good sinking
Is when I'm sinking fast and deep for
You
You caught me when I was winking
Now I think my winking days are through
Could it be another change?
To come and rearrange
Why can't she just feel the way I do
