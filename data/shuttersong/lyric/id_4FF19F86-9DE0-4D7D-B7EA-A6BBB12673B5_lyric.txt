Shirt buttoned to the neck
In check
Time to let go
Ruby red lipstick
Smoke rises like a signal

Stealing half of the day just to spend at night
Stealing hearts when the break under UV lights
Cause their walk is full of empty
Talk
Talk
Talk

I've got friends
You have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

I've got friends
you have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans
But we never keep them

How you dress I'm impressed
But you acting like you don't care
ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooo-oooh
Is your smile out of style
Just like the brands that you don't wear
ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooo-oooh
Stealing half of the day just to spend at night
Hey! Hey!
Stealing hearts when the break under UV lights
Cause their lungs are full of awkward
Cough
Cough

Coughs
I've got friends
You have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans

But we never keep them
I've got friends
You have got friends
Talkin bout the weekend
We make plans
Just to make plans

But we never keep them
