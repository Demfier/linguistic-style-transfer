Liam: You tell me that you're sad and lost your way
You tell me that you tears are here to stay
But I know you're only hiding
And I just wanna see ya

You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again

Niall: But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
And I'll be here for you

All: Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

Zayn: I wish that I could take you to the start
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry and fall apart
I'll be there to hold you

Louis: You tell me that you heard it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you were laughing
So let's just laugh again

Niall: But don't burn out even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
Back to you

All: Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way

Zayn: Through the dark
And you don't need
You don't need to run
And you will see, it's easy to be loved

I know you wanna be loved

Liam: Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
All: Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way
Zayn: Through the dark
