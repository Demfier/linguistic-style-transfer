和你的这些小细节
You can't go to bed,
你睡前
Without a cup of tea,
总要喝上一杯茶
And maybe that's the reason

That you talk, in your sleep

And all those conversations
你说过的那些话
Are the secrets that I keep

It's you,
这些细节
They add up to
拼成了一个你
I'm in love with you,
我爱上了你，
And all these little things
和你的这些小细节
You'll never love yourself

Half as much as I love you
永远不会及我对你的爱一半多

Maybe you'll love yourself,

Like I love you

Oh
And I've just let these little things
好吧，
Slip, out of my mouth,
我已诉说了对你的感情
'Cause it's you, oh it's you,
因为我太爱你了。
It's you,
这些点滴
They add up to
造就了我爱的你
And I'm in love with you,
我爱你，
And all these little things,
爱你的一切
I won't let these little things
我不会轻易诉说我的心意
Slip, out of my mouth,
But if it's true,
如果这些甜言蜜语真的说出口，
It's you, it's you,
那你一定会是听的那个
They add up to,
这些点点滴滴就凝成了你
I'm in love with you,
我爱你，
And all your little things
爱你的全部
