B-b-better in stereo
B-b-better in stereo.

I'm up with the sunshine (let's go)
I lace up my high tops (oh, no)
Slam dunk, ready or not
Yeah show me what you got

I'm under the spotlight (holler)
I dare you, come on and follow
You dance to your own beat
I'll sing the melody

When you say yeah, I say no
When you say stop, all I wanna do is go, go, go

You the other half of me
The half I'll never be
The half that drives me crazy
You the better half of me
The half I'll always need
We both know
We're better in stereo

(B-b-better in stereo) oh oh oh
(B-b-better in stereo) oh oh oh
And when we're together (oh, yeah)

In sweet harmony, oh so rare
If we could just agree
We would go major league
When you say yeah
And I say no

When you say stop, all I wanna do is go, go, go

You the other half of me
The half I'll never be
The half that drives me crazy
You the better half of me
The half I'll always need
We both know
We're better in stereo

You say it's wrong, I say it's right
You say it's black, I say it's white
You take a left, and I take a right
But at the end of the day
We both know
We're better in stereo

You
The other half of me
The half I'll never be
The half that drives me crazy
You
The better half of me
The half I'll always need (yeah)
We both know
We're better in stereo (stereo)
(B-b-better in stereo)
Better in stereo
(B-b-better in stereo)
Oh, oh, oh
Better in stereo
Oh, oh, oh
Better in stereo
(B-b-better in stereo)
Oh, oh, oh
Better in stereo
