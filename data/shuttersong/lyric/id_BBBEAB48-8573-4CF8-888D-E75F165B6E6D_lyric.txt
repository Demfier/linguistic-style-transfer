
I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type.
I like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking.
Don't like his baggy jeans but I'm a like what's underneath them.
And no I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits.
First let's see the west end.
I'll show you to my brethren.
I'm liking this American Boy. American Boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy

Can we get away this weekend?
Take me to Broadway.
Let's go shopping baby then we'll go to a caf√©.
Let's go on the subway.
Take me to your hood.
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good.
Dress in all your fancy clothes.
Sneaker's looking fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes.
Walking that walk.
Talk that slick talk.
I'm liking this American Boy. American Boy.
