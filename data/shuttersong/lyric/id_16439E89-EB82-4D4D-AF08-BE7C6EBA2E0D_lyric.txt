Just a small town girl\n Livin' in a lonely world\n She took the midnight train\n Goin' anywhere\n Just a city boy\n Born and raised in South Detroit\n He took the midnight train\n Goin' anywhere\n A singer in a smokey room\n A smell of wine and cheap perfume\n For a smile they can share the night\n It goes on and on and on and on\n Strangers waiting\n Up and down the boulevard\n Their shadows searching\n In the night\n Streetlights' people\n Livin' just to find emotion\n Hidin'' somewhere in the night\n Workin' hard to get my fill\n Everybody wants a thrill\n Payin' anything to roll the dice\n Just one more time\n Some will win\n Some will lose\n Some were born to sing the blues\n Oh' the movie never ends\n It goes on and on and on and on\n Strangers waiting\n Up and down the boulevard\n Their shadows searching\n In the night\n Streetlights' people\n Livin' just to find emotion\n Hidin'' somewhere in the night\n Don't stop believin'\n Hold on to the feelin'\n Streetlights' people' oh \n Don't stop believin'\n Hold on\n Streetlights' people' oh \n Don't stop believin'\n Hold on to the feelin'\n Streetlights' people' oh
