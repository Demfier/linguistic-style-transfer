Im angry sometimes
My heart's on the line
These problems are mine to hold

Yeah
I'll push and you'll pull but
I'm just too confused so
I'm crawlin into a hole
Are you gonna hold me
Down
I'm high when I come back
Down
I fall till I hit the ground so tell me now

Are you gonna hold me
Down
King with a tainted crown
I fall till I hit the ground
So tell me now

Are you gonna hold me
Down
Your angry sometimes
I'm fuelin a fire
To watch you go up in flames
You push and you pull
But, just too confused
Tell me that i can change
Are you gonna hold me
Down
I'm high when I come back
Down
I fall till I hit the ground so tell me now

Are you gonna hold me
Down
king with a tainted crown
I fall till I hit the ground
So tell me now

Are you gonna hold me
Down
I keep on slippin but i know its not my fault I just need closure

I know it's on the way
I know it's on the way
but i keep runnin to my problems
To the same place where I got them where I got them
I know it's not the way
Are you gonna hold me
Down
I'm high when I come back
Down
I fell till I hit the ground
So tell me now

Are you gonna hold me
Down
King with a tainted crown
I fall till I hit the ground
So tell me now
Are you gonna hold me
Down
