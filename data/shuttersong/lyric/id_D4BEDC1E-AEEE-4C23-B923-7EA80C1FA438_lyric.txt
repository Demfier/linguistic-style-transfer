I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna
Do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room
Full of my safest sounds
Cause you know that
I can't trust myself
And my 3am shadow
I'd rather fuel a fantasy
Than deal with this alone
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you
Cause your hands and lips still
Know their way around
And I know I like to draw at night
It starts to get surreal
But the less time
That I spend with you
The less you need to heal
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
Talk me down
So if you don't mind
I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Gray areas and expectations
But I'm not the one
If we're honest yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you
And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you
But I wanna sleep next to you
And that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room
Full of my safest sounds
So come over now and talk me down
