Chilin' on the West Side, playing my song
Gotta that kia soul With my cheap shades on
Gonna run right through the night

Jump off the gate, fall to the ground
It don't matter still hitting this town
Oh it never felt so right

Tonight we're Runnin' around the boulevard
I couldn't know, I couldn't ask for more

So sick and tired of staying up to see the break of dawn
Everybody's taken shots, till they're passed out on the lawn
Broken hearts and Styrofoam and empty double cups
I guess I'm Ordinary cause I don't give a what
I don't give a what
I don't give a what
I don't give a what

Chillin' on the sofa with a tank top
Supercalifragilistic down to my socks
Let it go right to my head
TV screen, Mario Kart
Everybody knows that I get a head start
And it's never left unsaid

Tonight we're Runnin' around the boulevard
I couldn't know, I couldn't ask for more

So sick and tired of staying up to see the break of dawn
Everybody's taken shots, till they're passed out on the lawn
Broken hearts and Styrofoam and empty double cups
I guess I'm Ordinary cause I don't give a what
I don't give a what
I don't give a what
I don't give a what

So sick and tired of staying up to see the break of dawn
Everybody's taken shots, till they're passed out on the lawn
Broken hearts and Styrofoam and empty double cups
I guess I'm Ordinary cause I don't give a what
I don't give a what
I don't give a what
Broken hearts and Styrofoam and empty double cups
I guess I'm Ordinary cause I don't give a what!
