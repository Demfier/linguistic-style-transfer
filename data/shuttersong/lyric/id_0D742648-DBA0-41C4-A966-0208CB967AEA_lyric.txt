I've never looked at you the way
I did tonight and now your face
Your lips, your eyes, you're stuck inside my head
The thought of me and you together
I wish it'd last forever
Why am I here and not with you instead?

I, I don't want to mess this up
But you are all I'm thinking of

Maybe I should stay, maybe I should go
Maybe I should just leave this alone
And if this isn't right, I'm OK with being wrong
Cause I don't want to miss you when you're gone

We could be perfect or just a disaster
We could be in love and never fight
We could be sad or happy ever after
It could be us instead of you and I
Maybe we should try

Standing here outside your door
Is this what you've been waiting for
Or will you even let me come inside
I've come up with a lame excuse
I'm hoping I don't have to use
And here it goes I'll only knock one time

I, I don't want mess this up
But you are all I'm thinking of

Maybe I should stay, maybe I should go
Maybe I should just leave this alone
And if this isn't right, I'm OK with being wrong
Cause I don't want to miss you when you're gone

We could be perfect or just a disaster
We could be in love and never fight
We could be sad or happy ever after
It could be us instead of you and I
Maybe we should try
Ooh, ooh, woah
Maybe we should try
Ooh, ooh, oooh

I've never looked at you the way
I did tonight and now your face
Your lips, your eyes, you're stuck inside my head

Maybe I should I stay, Maybe I should go
Maybe I should just leave this alone
And if this isn't right, I'm OK with being wrong
'Cause I don't wanna miss you when you're gone

We could be perfect or just a disaster
We could be in love and never fight
We could be sad or happy ever after
It could be us instead of you and I
Maybe we should try
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Maybe we should try
Ooh
Cause it could be us instead of you and I
Maybe we should try
