You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Spending my days locked in a haze
Tryin' to forget you babe
I fall back down
Got to stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Spending my days locked in a haze
Tryin' to forget you babe
I fall back down
Got to stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
