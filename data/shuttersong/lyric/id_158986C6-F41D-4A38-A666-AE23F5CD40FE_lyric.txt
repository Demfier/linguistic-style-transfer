Reverie - ILLENIUM/King Deco
When you scream enough
But you can't make a sound
You know it's only a dream
When your back hits the ground
And things turn around
You know it was only a dream
Cause nothing is as bad as you think
Even when you're pulling at the seams
When the lights go out you still got me
Ooh
Detours lead to barricades
And home is for your friends are fake
I'll be there to clear the way
Ooh
And you you know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down
And you you know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down
When the roof caves in
And you just can't win
You know it'll only get better
Only get better
When you fall too far
Can't go back to the start
You know it'll only get better
Only get better
Cause nothing is as bad as you think
Even when you're pulling at the seams
When the lights go out you still got me
Ooh
Detours lead to barricades
And home is for your friends are fake
I'll be there to clear the way
Ooh
And you you know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down
And you you know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down
