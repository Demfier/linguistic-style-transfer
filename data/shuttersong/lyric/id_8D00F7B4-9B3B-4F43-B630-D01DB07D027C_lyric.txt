...
I been staring at the celling,
watching the fans go round and round round
cause I can't hear my breathing

the words we said are still so loud, loud, loud
and we been drifting off so far
that I don't even know where we are
before we jump, before we leave

and all this lost for you and me, yeah

If we're not stupid,
we'll both hold on for dear love
fight the way through this, it's not worth just giving up
cause I got some fire left in me
And I don't see us endin' this way
If we're not stupid,

we'll both hold on for dear love, love
...
I been weight down by the silence,
all this words that don't come out, out

be tempting just to write it
and say I'm sorry without a sound, sound, sound
cause we been drifting off so far
that I don't even know where we are

but we can try, and we can speak
before we lost in definitly
if we're not stupid,
we'll both hold on for dear love
fight the way through this
It's not worth just giving up
Cause I got some fire left in me
And I don't see us endin' this way
If we're not stupid,
we'll both hold on for dear love, love
I been terribly human
using you like a punching bag
and you been terribly angry
taking out all of yours worst words on me
and I see what we were
and I know that we're hurt,
but I know that is worth it to fight
for all of our love tonight
If we're not stupid,
we'll both hold on for dear love
fight the way through this
it's not worth just giving up
cause I got some fire left in me
and I don't see us endin' this way
If we're not stupid,
we'll both hold on for dear love, love, love, love, love
