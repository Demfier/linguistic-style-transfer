Marching down the street
In my lightning feet
And the shine's too fine to be real
Fake it so i care for the glisten and the glare
And now it's glare
Something i'm starting to feel

Oh oh ah my eagle eyes
my my my eagle eyes

Left it up to the great wide open
To find out the places i'd be
In my sleep they were growing all the time
And now they've grown too far from me
Didn't know how to wait out the ages
So i wrecked my only way through
Blind bravery forgets the wars it wages
But i'll fight just to see if it's true
Left it up to the great wide open
To find out the places i'd be
In my sleep they were growing all the time
And now they've grown too far from me
Didn't know how to wait out the ages
So i wrecked my only way through
Blind bravery forgets the wars it wages
But i'll fight just to see if it's true
