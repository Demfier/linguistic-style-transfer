Okay, Coconut Man, Moonheads, and P.
You ready!

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second

Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high

That you can't even have a good time
Everybody look to the left (yeah)
Everybody look to the right
Can you feel that (yeah)

We'll pay them with love tonight
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (ha) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance

Forget about the price tag
(Okay)
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite!
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes

Am I the only one gettin' tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feelin'

All right.
Everybody look to the left (to the left)
Everybody look to the right (to the right)
Can you feel that (yeah)

We'll pay them with love tonight...
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (ha) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching.
Ain't about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
Wanna make the world dance

Forget about the price tag.

Yeah yeah
Well, keep the price tag
And take the cash back
Just give me six streams and a half stack
And you can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I...
Yes all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what, in 30 seconds I'm leaving to Mars
Yes we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on the life
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
Waiting to see us in a sign of defeat? Uh-uh

So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (ha) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching.

Ain't about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag.
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (yeah-yeah) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching.
Ain't about the (whoo!) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag.
