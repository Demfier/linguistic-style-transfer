I hear voices
Awoken from my sleep
I'm haunted by the thoughts, I grieve
If the earthquake starts, buildings fall
I'm pulling pictures off from our bones
Till you say here, here I am
Oh, and here, here I am
All the ghosts
They float, float around us

How they turned all our dreams into dust?
We saved your mother
But darling, there was no spark left for us
We won the battle, but lost the heart
And now I know that here, here I am
Oh and here, here I am
Oh, hard to believe
It's said and done, hard to believe

It's not dead and gone

I want to believe

All is well that ends well
But I just can't convince myself
Run towards the stars, or make them shine
Fight the tide until the day we die
Run towards the stars, can't make them shine
But you know I'll try
Run towards the stars, or make them shine
Fight the tide until the day we die
Run towards the stars, can't make them shine
But you know I'll try
For you I'll try
