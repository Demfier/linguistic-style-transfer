I used to bite my tongue
and hold my breath
scared to rock the boat and mess
so I stood quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot that I had a choice
I let you push me pass the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
you help me down but I got up
already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice,
you hear that sound
like thunder gonna shake the ground
you help me down but I got up (heay)
get ready cause I had enough
I see it all I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger a fighter
dancing through the fire
cause I am a champion and you gonna hear me roar
louder louder than a lion
cause I am a champion and you gonna
hear me roar
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
you gonna hear me roar
now I'm floating like a butterfly
stinging like a bee I earned my strips
I went from zero
to my own hero

already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice, you hear that sound
like thunder gonna shake the ground

Then it hit me, maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing

What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

I was living on a fault line, the fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough, I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff

Then it hit me, you won't permit me
To be an individual just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison

What a high
When you open your mind
For the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

So long conformity
And ambiguality is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate

I started living outside for the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside

Ha ha ha
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
Oh, living outside of the box, of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems that nice
