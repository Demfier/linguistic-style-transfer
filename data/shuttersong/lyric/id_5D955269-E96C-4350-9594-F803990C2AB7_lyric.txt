Stellar - Daddy¡¯s Groove
All the stars in an endless sky
Couldn't shine as bright as you and I
The way you're making me feel tonight
Stellar  fuckin' stellar
So close I'm afraid we might
Explode as soon as we ignite
The way you making me feel tonight
Stellar  fuckin stellar
Stellar  stellar  fuckin
Stellar  fuckin
Stellar  fuckin
Stellar  fuckin stellar
So close I'm afraid we might
Explode as soon as we ignite
The way you're making me feel tonight
Stellar  fuckin stellar
Ooooo  ooooo
Ooooo  ooooo
Stellar  fuckin
Ooooo  ooooo
