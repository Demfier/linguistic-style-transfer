Crazy - Shawn Mendes\n Think I don't need a watch to tell the time\n Think I don't need the sun to help me shine\n Think I don't need a girl to be alright\n Guess I didn't know\n Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet\n Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep\n Thought I didn't need love to be complete\n Guess I didn't know\n That I just got this crazy feeling\n I've been making someone wait for me\n For me\n You're all I think about when I'm awake\n Part of every night and every day\n And everything's a mess when you're away\n Now I ain't know\n All of this is getting really old\n I'm having trouble sleeping on my own\n Feeling like a house but not a home\n I want you to know\n That I just got this crazy feeling\n I've been making someone wait for me  for me\n Guess I need a watch to tell the time\n Guess I need the sun to help me shine\n And I really need you in my life\n Now I know\n That you give me this crazy feeling\n And you won't have to wait no more for me\n For me\n And I just got this crazy feeling\n I've been making someone wait for me
