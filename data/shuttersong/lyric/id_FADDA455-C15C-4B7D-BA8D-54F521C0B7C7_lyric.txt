Don't take it down
Don't take it down
Don't take it down
Don't take it down
I need you another way
Give me up and that won't break me
I'll take it on all the way
It's moving on to move away
But I need you another way
Give me up and that won't break me
I'll take it on all the way
It's moving on to move away run
Don't take it down
Don't take it down
Don't take it down
Don't take it down
I need you another way
Give me up and that won't break me
I'll take it on all the way
It's moving on to move away
But I need you another way
Give me up and that won't break me
I'll take it on all the way
It's moving on to move away run
