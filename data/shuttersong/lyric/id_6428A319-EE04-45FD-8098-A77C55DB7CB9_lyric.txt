My heart is filled with love and care,
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there!
The answer's simple:
You lift me up!
The view up here, I see all the stars:
There go Venus and there go Mars,
Somethin' you been through!
You're from above!

Hey, when I first saw you, I got excited,
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it,
But I didn't know,
I didn't let go,
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it,
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it,
But I didn't know
You're s'posed to let it go...

Like a gust of wind,
You head me off sometimes!
Like a gust of wind,
You push me back every once in a while!
Like a gust of wind,
You remind me there's someone up there,
Who whooshes in
The air I need to power my sail!

When I open the window,
I wanna hug you,
Cause you remind me of the air,
I said \
