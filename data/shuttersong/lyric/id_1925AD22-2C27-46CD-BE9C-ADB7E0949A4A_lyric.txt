Control - Halsey\n They send me away to find them a fortune\n A chest filled with diamonds and gold\n The house was awake\n With shadows and monsters\n The hallways they echoed and groaned\n I sat alone in bed 'til the morning\n I'm crying they're coming for me\n And I tried to hold these secrets inside me\n My mind's like a deadly disease\n I'm bigger than my body\n I'm colder than this home\n I'm meaner than my demons\n I'm bigger than these bones\n And all the kids cried out\n Please stop you're scaring me\n I can't help this awful energy\n Goddamn right you should be scared of me\n Who is in control\n I paced around for hours I'm empty\n I jumped at the slightest of sounds\n And I couldn't stand the person inside me\n I turned all the mirrors around\n I'm bigger than my body\n I'm colder than this home\n I'm meaner than my demons\n I'm bigger than these bones\n And all the kids cried out\n Please stop you're scaring me\n I can't help this awful energy\n Goddamn right you should be scared of me\n Who is in control\n I'm well acquainted\n With villains that live in my bed\n They beg me to write them\n So they'll never die when I'm dead\n And I've grown familiar\n With villains that live in my head\n They beg me to write them\n So I'll never die when I'm dead\n I'm bigger than my body\n I'm colder than this home\n I'm meaner than my demons\n I'm bigger than these bones\n And all the kids cried out\n Please stop you're scaring me\n I can't help this awful energy\n Goddamn right you should be scared of me\n Who is in control\n And all the kids cried out\n Please stop you're scaring me\n I can't help this awful energy\n Goddamn right you should be scared of me\n Who is in control
