Get jazzy on it

I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap, girl
Riding comfortable
Cause I know what the girl them mean
New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
You make it hard to leave

Been around the world
Don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

You know the words to my songs
No habla ingles
Our conversations ain't long
But you know what is
Cause I know what the girl them want
London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
I think I need a new one

Been around the world
Don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

Uno met a friend in Rio
Dos she was all on me, oh
Tres we can menage a three oh
Cuatro, oh¡­
Dos Cadenas, close  to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck. Chest  to chest, tongue on neck.
International oral sex, every picture I take I pose a threat
Bought a jet, what you expect?
Her pussy's so good, I bought her a pet.
Anyway, every day I'm trying  to get  to it
Got it saved in my phone, under big booty.
Anyway, every day I'm trying  to get  to it

Been around the world, don¡¯t speak the language
But your booty don¡¯t need explaining
All I really need  to understand is when you, you  talk  dirty  to  me
 Talk  dirty  to  me,  talk  dirty  to  me,  talk  dirty  to  me
Get jazzy on  me
