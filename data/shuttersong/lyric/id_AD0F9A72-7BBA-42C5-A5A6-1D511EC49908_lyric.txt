Sometimes i feel like i don't have a partner
sometimes i feel like my only friend
is the city i live in, the city of angels
lonely as i am, together we cry
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion
i walk through her hills cause she knows who i am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
i never worry, now that is a lie.

Well, i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way
i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
it's hard to believe that i'm all alone
at least i have her love, the city she loves me
lonely as i am, together we cry

Well, i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way
well, i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh no, no, no, yeah, yeah
love me, i say, yeah yeah
