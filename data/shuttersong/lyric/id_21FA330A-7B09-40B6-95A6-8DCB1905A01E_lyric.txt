Come let me out
let me go
I gotta break the cage

I feel the bass
getting loud
I'm in here whining it

It's wall to wall
getting hot
bodies everywhere

So let me out
let me out
out out out

I dont wanna wait no more
I wanna risk it all
can't do it on my own
we takin' over
leggo

everybody, everywhere

Yella yella ay(? 8)

Put ya guns up in the air
guns up in the air

Put ya guns up in the air
guns up in the air

Put ya guns up in the air
guns up in the air

Put ya guns up in the air
guns up in the air

I dont wanna wait no more
I wanna risk it all
can't do it on my own
we takin' over
leggo

everybody, everywhere

Yella yella ay(? 8)

I dont wanna wait no more
I wanna risk it all
can't do it on my own
we takin' over
leggo

Yalla yella ay (? 8)

Yella yella ay
yella yella ay, ay, ay
Yella yella ay
Yella yella ay
yella yella ay
