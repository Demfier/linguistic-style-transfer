6 a.m sun rise shinning through my window see
A brand new day about to start
Eyes wide shut, inside my sheets, I'm so warm here
Scrunch my eyelids, yawn a little too

I feel something changed
No fear, no constrains
No future reminds
Only presents stays
Pure consciousness feeling now
My thoughts are all gone
Finally see crystal clear
Get up & stand up it's time to wake up

Feel your power
Look inside your soul
Holy experience Be here, breathe it, take it, give it

Feel your power
Look inside your soul
Holy experience No separate presence, in all we are one
May seem hard
But it won't if you don't feel afraid
Leave the matrix far behind
You'll feel alive
Getting rid of that old paradigm
Step ahead you'll be alright
I feel something changed
No fear, no constrains
No future reminds
Only presents stays Pure consciousness feeling now
My thoughts are all gone
Finally see crystal clear
Get up & stand up it's time to wake up

Live daydreaming is not all there is to
Feel alive and connected holy experience you
Get up and stand up it's time to wake up Feel your power Look inside your soul
Holy experience
Be here, breathe it, take it, give it
Feel your power
Look inside your soul
Holy experience
No separate presence, in all we are one
