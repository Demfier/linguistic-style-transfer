I don't know how you deal\n With all the pressure to look impressive\n And go out in heels\n I feel for you¡­\n Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you\n You wake up, put makeup on\n Stare in the mirror but its clear that\n You can't face what's wrong\n No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on\n Your roommate yelling\n ¡°Why you gotta take so long?¡±\n What it's like to have a crooked smile\n I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down\n I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down\n This crooked smile\n You're the one that was tryna keep me way down\n Like a sudden all you know if I'm on my way down\n To all the women with the flaws\n Know it's hard my darling\n You wonder why you're lonely and\n Your man's not calling\n You keep falling victim cause you're insecure\n And when I tell you that\n You're beautiful you can't be sure\n Cause you see that no one wants you back\n And it got you asking\n So all you see is what you lacking\n Not what you packing\n Take it from a man that loves what you got\n And baby you're a star\n Don't let 'em tell you you're not\n Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair\n Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care\n Cause what's real is something\n That the eyes can't see\n That the hands can't touch\n That them broads can't be, and that's you\n Never let 'em see your friend\n And if you need a friend to pick you up\n I'll be around\n And we can ride with the windows down\n The music loud\n I can tell you ain't laughed in a while\n But I wanna see that crooked smile\n I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down\n I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down\n You're the one that was tryna keep me way down\n Like a sudden all you know if I'm on my way down\n Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)\n Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)\n You're the one that was trying to keep me way down\n Like the sun, I know you know\n I found my way back 'round\n We only fronting like the people on the screen\n You know them movie stars\n Picture perfect beauty queens\n But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em\n Look at the nation\n That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten\n Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail\n Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already\n I asked if my skin pale\n Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?\n Yo one more time for the 'Ville\n And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil\n Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed\n Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail\n I got money for the bail now, well now.\n If you asking will I tell now?
