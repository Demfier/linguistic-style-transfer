Soldier
Take off your armor
Show me your heart
This is home

And it's stronger
Stronger than water
Deeper than reason
Longer than time

Here we are in the end of the movie
I've never felt more alive
It's time to rise

We're the last of our kind
It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And we're out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though
We're the last of our kind
Last of our kind
The last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
But the last of our kind

This is paradise
Turn off the search light
We're where we belong

Standing tall at the end of the story
Watching worlds collide
It's time to rise

We're the last of our kind
It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And we're out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though
We're the last of our kind

Here we are now
With nothing to lose
I know without love we won't pull through
Cause deep in the night
There is a light and it guides us to truth

It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And we're out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though
We're the last of our kind
Last of our kind
The last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
But the last of our kind
