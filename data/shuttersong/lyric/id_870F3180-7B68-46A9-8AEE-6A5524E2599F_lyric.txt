Sipping on ros√©, Silverlake sun, coming up all lazy
(This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh, she is a Daisy
Playing ping pong all night long, everything's all neon and hazy
(This is how we do)

All my girls vintage Chanel baby
It's no big deal, It's no big deal, It's no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' ya we do it like that
This is how we do, do do, this is how we do

Big hoops, maroon lips, my click hopping in my Maseratti
(This is how we do)
Santa Barbara-chic, at La Super Rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all japanese-y
(This is how we do)

Day drinking at the Wildcat, sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke
It's no big deal, It's no big deal, It's no big deal
This is no big deal
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' ya we do it like that

This is how we do, do do, do do, do this is how we do

This one goes out to ladies, at breakfast, in last night's dress
Uh-huh, I see you

Yo, this goes out to all you kids that still have their cars at the club valet and

Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money
