(Toxic)
Check this out ya dig?
You've vome to the last and final record
Toxic gettin crunk on you hoes
My nigga KX-Zilla, Steve The Guitar Man droppin the rythm
And I got the whole Legit Ballers family up in hea nigga
A yo Beanie Franks
You the early bird of this muthafucka
GUNNIN!

(Beanie Franks)
Picture a niggas thats raw
Amber fire his ass and what we'll say is what we saw
Muthafuckas I slaughter
Blow 'em out the water
L-E-G-I-T that's Ballers
My styles as lethal
As a bitch that's found with AIDS gettin loose
Nigga before you get spraid wit some hot shit
While you run I pop shit
Yo ghetto aint no harder than mine, fuck that block shit
You cant manage them thangs
The robber takin and born in the range
Battle the match and bang
I hold my gun up high screamin \
