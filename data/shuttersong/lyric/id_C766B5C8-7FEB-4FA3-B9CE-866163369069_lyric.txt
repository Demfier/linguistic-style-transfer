Yo, listen up here's the story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue
Like him inside and outside

Blue his house
With a blue little window
And a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen...

I'm blue
Da ba dee, da ba die x7
I'm blue
Da ba dee, da ba die x7

I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the colour of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my corvette its in and outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

I'm blue
Da ba dee, da ba die x7
I'm blue
Da ba dee, da ba die x7

I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the colour of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my corvette its in and outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me
I'm blue
Da ba dee da ba die x7
I'm blue
Da ba dee da ba die x7
