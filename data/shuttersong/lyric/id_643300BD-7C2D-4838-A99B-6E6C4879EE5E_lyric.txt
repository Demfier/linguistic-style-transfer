Right now is the right time
For the good thing in life let's celebrate
Let's bring upon the better times
And let the saddest time disappear £¨ooh£©
I feel like a champion in a stadium
There's love in pandemonium
Imma purpose in my memory as the best time
This is the best one yet and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one this is the best one
This is the best one yet and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one this is the best one
This is the best one yet
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate let's do it right now Let's celebrate
And not hesitate
We're gonna rock into the top like elevate
Bottoms up here we go
Let's intoxicate
I was feeling good but now I'm feeling free
Best ever and you know I don't exaggerate
This moment is the moment I will appreciate
Today is the day I will remember
This is the best one yet and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one this is the best one
This is the best one yet and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one this is the best one
This is the best one yet
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
This is your moment this is your moment
This is the time this is the time
To get it right tonight
To get it right
You don't wanna let the moment pass you by
So come on and see this one in a photograph
Everything that made us cried and made us laughed
The night is young and will raise a glass
Would make it count like the best one we ever
The best one yet £¨x14£©
This is the best one yet and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one this is the best one
This is the best one yet and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one this is the best one
This is the best one yet
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
