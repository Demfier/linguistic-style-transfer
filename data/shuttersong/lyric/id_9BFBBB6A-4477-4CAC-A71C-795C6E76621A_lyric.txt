I've been watching myself, turning from bad to worse
I've been locked up in the basement putting bad habits first
I won't answer my phone cus I wanna be left alone
Just she'd all the skin that makes me well and choke

I'm not alive
I'm just as good as dead
I can't find a reason why I should even get outta bed

Just make it stop
Just make it go away
I'll give you everything I have if you got the right words to say

I've been watching myself, turning from bad to worse
I've been locked up in the basement putting bad habits first
I won't answer my phone cus I wanna be left alone
Just she'd all the skin that makes me well and choke

But I can't get by
I haven't slept in years
If I can just get away from my shadow I'm in the clear

Then it will stop
And it will all go away
I'll be everything I want, everything I wanted to be

I'm outta my mind and outta your sight [x7]
I'm outta my mind

So I just drive
It doesn't matter where
I put my foot to the floor let the wind blow through my hair

I'll never stop
There's nothing for me out there
