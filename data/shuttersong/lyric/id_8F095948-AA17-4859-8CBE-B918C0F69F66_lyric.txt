There are times I can leave my heart wide open
There are days I believe I can heal wounds on me
Then there are times I could come to you and hurt you
I could easily bring you tears, I could send you to hell, I know you

Yes I know you
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby

I'm forever yours
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby

Forever yours
You were mine and I was yours for one night
Yes you were mine and there is no one who's like me
Oh, these screams, they wake me up in the night

They violently fill my room, they keep me awake, I hate you
I just hate you
Oh I hate you
And I will find something more

Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
I'm forever yours
I will find something more

Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
I'm forever yours
Ooooh
And I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
I'm forever yours
I'm forever yours
I'm forever yours
