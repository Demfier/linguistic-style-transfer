You don't have to worry baby
I'll promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul
You go, I go, We go, that's all she wrote
I'll be your baby
I promise not to let you go

Love you like crazy
Now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say, say you'll never let me go
Take you away from here
It's nothing between us but space, and time
I'll be your own little star, let me shine you up
Be your own little universe, make me your girl!

Come take my hand
I won't let you go
I'll be your friend
I will love you so deeply
I will be the one, to kiss you at night

I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby
I promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy
Now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Say, say you'll never let me go
Baby come on, get up on it
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you baby let's go
Baby, let's go
I wanna provide this lovin that you giving
I ain't fronting,
Baby, let's go

Boy come to me (Come to me!)
And return your rain into sun (Come to me, babe!)
You don't have to worry baby
I'll promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul
You go, I go, We go, that's all she wrote
(Instrumental)
I just wanna be with you

I just wanna live for you

Bring your love to me!
Come take my hand

Love you like crazy
