Christmas night, another fight
Tears we've cried are flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

I took my feet to Oxford street
Trying to right or wrong
Just walk away those windows
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snowfall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

A group of candles on me are flickering
Oh they flicker and they flow

And I am up here holding on to all those chandeleers of hope
And like some drunken in this city
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I always loved you darling

And how I always will
But when you're still waiting for the snowfall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall

It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas Lights

Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet

May all your troubles soon be gone
Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on
Those Christmas Lights
Light up the street
Maybe they bring her back to me

Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas Lights keep shining on
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
Oh Christmas Lights
Light up the streets
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas Lights keep shining on
