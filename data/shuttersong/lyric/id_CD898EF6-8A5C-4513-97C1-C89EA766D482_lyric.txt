Sit me down
I know I haven't been by your side
I'm dragging my feet, lost my stride
I've been painting pictures in my head and falling short
Losing my direction, turn me around
I've been just coasting
My mind put to motion
We move like the ocean
But I can't swim anymore
Wake me up
I fell in love in a dream, but I can't remember your face
Take me for a test drive
Chew me up, spit me out
I don't need your pat on the back
I've been just coasting
My mind put to motion
We move like the ocean
But I can't swim anymore
