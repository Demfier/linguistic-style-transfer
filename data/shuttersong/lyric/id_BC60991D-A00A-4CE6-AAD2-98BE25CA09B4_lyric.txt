When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'cause she' stay strong yeah yeah
she is always in my corner
right there when I want her
all these other girls are tempting
but I'm empty when you're gone
and they say
do you need me
do you think I'm pretty
do I make you feel like cheating.
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
she is always right there when I need her
oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
she is always right there when I need her

She walks like a model
she grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle yeah yeah
'cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
all these other girls are tempting
but I'm empty when you're gone
and they say
do you need me?
do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like Cheating.
and I'm like no, not really cause'

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
she is always right there when I need her
oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
she is always right there when I need her

She gives me love and affection
baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me

mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection

is just for me to pop the question
