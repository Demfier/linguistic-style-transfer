Are you ready? Here we go!

Slow, slow. Quick-quick, slow.
Slow, slow. Quick-quick, slow.

Countdown it's getting near to flight time
Night stars are shining in my eyes
Ma' says I'm going to be the first one
To dance the be-bop in the skies!

Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)

Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)

I'll be the first to bossa nova
Ten thousand miles above L.A.!
Boogie my way beyond the radar
I'll bring a jive to outer space!

Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)

Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)

Hey! Here I am!
I hear the universe sing the celestial swing
I am not alone, are you receiving me clear?
There's others out here!
Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)
Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)
Orbital be-bop
Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)
Dancing in heaven, I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far (orbital be-bop)
