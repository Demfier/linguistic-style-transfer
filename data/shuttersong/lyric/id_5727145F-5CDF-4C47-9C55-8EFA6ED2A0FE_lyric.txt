Down by the River
I was drawn by your grace
Into tempest of oblivion
and to the lovers-place
I was stucked in a puddle
full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know
that weve paid unlike

Honey I know hey
when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away
the falseness of our past
And I know too
its been the hardest day for you
Lets throw them out the
window

thats what those lovers do
