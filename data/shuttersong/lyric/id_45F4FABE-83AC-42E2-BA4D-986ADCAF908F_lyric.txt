(originally by Miley Cyrus)
(feat. Jason Pitts)

It's our party we can do what we want
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want [2x]

Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a hell no
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight alright

So la da di da di, we like to party
Dancing with Tsui
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night
Can't you see it we who bout' that life
And we can't stop
And we won't stop 
We run things
Things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody

It's our party we can do what we want
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want

It's our party we can do what we want to 
It's our house we can love who we want to
It's our song we can sing if we want to
It's my mouth I can say what I want to
Yea, Yea, Yeah

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night
Can't you see it we who bout' that life
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things
Things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Yea, Yea, Yeah
