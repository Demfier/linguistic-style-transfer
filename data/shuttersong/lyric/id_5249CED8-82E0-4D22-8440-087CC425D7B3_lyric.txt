Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go

Can't live a day without you baby
Oh no...
If you're not here I don't know what I'm living for
You stared right in my eyes and said
Go slow
'Cause you've been hurt real bad not once but twice before

I I I I
I don't wanna fi-i-i-ight
You wanna say you trust me now but then you go and change your mind
Whyyy?...
Do it every ti-i-i-ime...
Just because he hurt you bad it's in the past
I just wanna love you right then

She said don't let go
'Cause I've been hurt before
Said I've been hurt before
Yes, I've been hurt before

So I said oh no no no
No, I won't let you go
No, I won't let you go
No, I can't let you go

I can't let go
Even if I tried
I can't, I can't sleep at night
Swallow my pride and let it die
'Cause I I can't let go
Even if I tried
I can't, I can't sleep at night
I can't, I can't say goodbye
'Cause I I can't let go

Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go

Nobody seems to understand
Why I stay
When I know you'll end up pushing me away
You got me working overtime all day
And just to see that pretty smile upon your face

I I I I
I don't wanna fi-i-i-ight
You wanna say you trust me now but then you go and change your mind
Whyyy?...
Do it every ti-i-i-ime
Just because he hurt you bad it's in the past
I just wanna love you right then

She said don't let go
'Cause I've been hurt before
Said I've been hurt before
Yes, I've been hurt before

So I said oh no no no
No, I won't let you go
No, I won't let you go
No, I can't let you go

I can't let go
Even if I tried
I can't, I can't sleep at night
Swallow my pride and let it die
'Cause I I can't let go
Even if I tried
I can't, I can't sleep at night
I can't, I can't say goodbye
'Cause I I can't let go

Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go
Can't can't can't go

I can't let go
Can't let can't let can't let
I can't let go
Even if I tried
I can't, I can't sleep at night
Swallow my pride and let it die
'Cause I I can't let go
Even if I tried
I can't, I can't sleep at night
I can't, I can't say goodbye
'Cause I I can't let go
Can't live a day without you baby
Oh no...
If you're not here I don't know what I'm living for
