We're no strangers to love

You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

Gotta make you understand

I just wanna tell you how i'm feeling
gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up

Never gonna let you down

Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

I get knocked down but i get up again

you're never going to keep me down
i get knocked down but i get up again
you're never going to keep me down
i get knocked down but i get up again
you're never going to keep me down
I get knocked down but i get up again

you're never going to keep me down
i get knocked down but i get up again
you're never going to keep me down
i get knocked down but i get up again

you're never going to keep me down
I get knocked down but i get up again
you're never going to keep me down
i get knocked down but i get up again

you're never going to keep me down

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but
You're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
I just wanna tell you how i'm feeling
gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
