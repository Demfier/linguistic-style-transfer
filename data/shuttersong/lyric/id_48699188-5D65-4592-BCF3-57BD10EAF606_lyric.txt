Angel
Knew you were special from the moment I saw you, I saw you
I said angel
I feel you're closer every time I call you, I call you
'Cause all I see are wings, All I can see your wings
But I know what I am, and the life I live, the life I live
And even though I sin, maybe we are born to live
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this, if we're meant for this
And if we're not, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
Said angel
You'll probably never take me back, and I know this, I know this
I said angel
I'm so desensitised to feeling these emotions, no emotions, baby
'Cause all I see are wings, All I can see your wings
But I know what I am, and the life I live, the life I live
And even though I sin, we are born to live
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this, if we're meant for this
And if we're not, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
And even though we live inside a dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring the light, you always seem to bring the light
And even though we live inside a dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring me light, you always seem to bring me light
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody, baby, I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody, I hope you find somebody, baby
Somebody to love, somebody to love
