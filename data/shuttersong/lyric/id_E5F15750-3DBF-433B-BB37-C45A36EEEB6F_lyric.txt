Rule number one
Is that you gotta have fun.
But, baby, when you're done
You gotta be the first to run.

Rule number two
Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose
So le-le-let me tell you.

This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing I la-la-love you.

At least I think I do?

'Cause I la-la-la-love you.

Rule number three
Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
Unless you wanna taste defeat.

Rule number four
Gotta be looking pure.
Kiss him goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more.

Girls, we do, whatever it will take
'Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break
In two. So it's better to be fake
Can't risk losing in love again, babe.
