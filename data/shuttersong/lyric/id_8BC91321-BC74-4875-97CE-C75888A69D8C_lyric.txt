Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about that things we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my faces flashing suns
Seek it out and you shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold

I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong

Doing the right thing

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about that things we could be

But, baby, I've been, I've been playing hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep

Dreaming about that things we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been playing hard
Said, no more counting dollars

We'll be, we'll be counting stars

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so wrong

Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about that things we could be

But, baby, I've been, I've been playing hard

Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about that things we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been playing hard

Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the liver
Lessons are learnt
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the liver
Lessons are learnt
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the liver
Lessons are learnt
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the liver

Everything that kills me makes feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
