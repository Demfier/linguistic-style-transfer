I often close my eyes
and I can see you smile
you reach out for my hand
and I'm woken from my dream
although your heart is mine
it's hollow inside
i never had your love
and I never will

and every night
i lay awake
thinking maybe you love me
like I've always loved you
but how can you love me
like I loved you
when you can't even look me straight in my eyes

I've never felt this way
to be so in love
to have someone there
yet feel so alone
aren't you supposed to be
the one to wipe my tears
the one to say that you would never leave

the waters calm and still
my reflection is there
i see you holding me
but then you disappear
all that is left of you
is a memory
one that only exist in my dreams

and every night
i lay awake
thinking maybe you love me
like I've always loved you
but how can you love me
like I loved you
when you can't even look me straight in my eyes

I don't know what hurts you
but i can feel it too
and it just hurts so much
to know that i can't do a thing
and deep down in my heart
somehow i just know
that no matter what
I'll always love you

I often close my eyes
and I can see you smile
you reach out for my hand
and I'm woken from my dream
although your heart is mine
it's hollow inside
i never had your love
and I never will
so why am i still here in the rain?
