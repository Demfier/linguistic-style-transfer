I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a shake
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get a cobra
Buggati for real, I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I said rackets, ratchets hold up
(I said rackets, ratchets hold up)

I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
