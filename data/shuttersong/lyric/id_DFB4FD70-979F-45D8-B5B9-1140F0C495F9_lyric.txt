Hey, I see a secret in your face
Did someone steal you away
Is there someone else in my place
I don't like this game
I can see the dirt in your hands
Cause I know the way that you dance
Don't cover up cause it shows
Mmm I wish you would
Stop right now whatcha doing
I know gotta needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing cause nobody's home and it's hell
oh yeah now I say
All my life I played like a winner
All i see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
All this time the saint was a sinner
the jokes on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
You have a natural sway
and you know how sweet you taste
But I can't take your flame
like a bullet through my veins
As you scratch beneath my skin
My resistance crumbling
I cover up but it shows
But I guess you know you can't
Stop right now whatcha doing
I know gotta needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing cause nobody's home and it's hell
oh yeah now I say
All my life I played like a winner
But all i see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
All this time the saint was a sinner
the jokes on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
All this time
I said all this time
All this time
All this time
All this time
I said all this time
All this time
All this time
All this time
All my life I played like a winner
But all i see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
All this time the saint was a sinner
the jokes on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
All my life I played like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
(All this time)
All this time the saint was a sinner
the jokes on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the Demons in my head
Oh, oh
