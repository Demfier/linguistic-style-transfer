Rolling strong
The voice of my father said
Don't give up, don't be forgotten
It's hell on Earth
I just wanna run away
They told me dreams don't grow from here
Stay alone, count your fears
Somewhere down the line I might figure it out
Singing all my songs
To bedrooms mirrors
Deep inside my heart I'm still here
We're always running away
And we don't even stop to think about it
The world's in our hands, yeah
They don't need to understand
We do it all own way
No matter what they try to say about it
We've got our own plans, yeah
They don't need to understand
They don't need to understand
It may be tough, almost killed me
At least that's how I remember the story
Over the years I've forgotten how it was
But I survived and I won't walk down
The same old road that they all followed
It only leads to a life not meant for me
Singing all my songs
To bedrooms mirrors
Deep inside my heart I'm here
We're always running away
And we don't even stop to think about it
The world's in our hands, yeah
They don't need to understand
We do it all own way
No matter what they try to say about it
We've got our own plans, yeah
They don't need to understand
Streets of my hometown
Seems strange now
It feel like a distant memory
I'm always fine cause I know you're trying
But you can never take, this dream for me
We're always running away
And we don't even stop to think about it
The world's in our hands, yeah
They don't need to understand
We do it our own way
No matter what they try to say about it
We've got our own plans, yeah
They don't need to understand
They don't need to understand
They don't need to understand
