Did you see me coming
Did you see I was there for the ride
Was I wasting time when I thought that I
Was with somebody with nothing to hide

Did you think about it
Did the thought even enter your head
Was it by design like the perfect crime
Did you mean every word that you said

I've tried putting myself in your place and I still feel the same
You've been looking to find an excuse
There's nobody else you can blame

Did you see me coming
Could you see me a good mile away
Did I talk too much
Did I laugh too loud
Was there something that I didn't say
Can I tell you something
Just in case you don't already know
Well it's crossed my mind
More than once that I
Should have left you a long time ago

Sometimes you make it look easy
To somebody like me
One day you're gonna turn around
And I'll be a bad memory
Did you see me coming
Did you see I was there for the ride
Was I wasting time when I thought that I
Was with someone with nothing to hide

Did you think about it
Did the thought even enter your head
Was it by design like the perfect crime
Did you mean every word that you said

I've tried putting myself in your place and I still feel the same
You've been looking to find an excuse
There's nobody else you can blame
