Skies are crying
I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence has its endings
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me
You can take everything I have

You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
As the smoke clears I awaken and untangle you from me

Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken but I'm standing on my feet
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am

Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Go run run run
I'm gonna stay right here

Watch you dissapear, yeah oh
Go run run run yeah it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass

Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skycraper
Like a skyscraper
