She don't leave makeup
After her kiss
All the boys at night
Think that she's theirs
All the secrets that you keep?

Might get spoken while you sleep
And all the boys and I
All the boys and I

Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I, too
(Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true?

Closer now.
And closer still.
Then it's closer to her
Til she knows you're there
And all our secrets that you keep?

Might get spoken while you sleep
And all the boys and I
All the boys and I

Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I, too
(Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true?

She came here to entertain you
You'll fall hard into her charm

And all the boys and I
All the boys and I
Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I, too
(Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true?
All the boys and I
All the boys and I
Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I, too
(Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true!?
