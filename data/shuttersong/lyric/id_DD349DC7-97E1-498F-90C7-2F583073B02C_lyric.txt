Yeah, it's 5Quad
It's Tion
Uh uh, let's go
I see you out with out cha girlfriends
I'm chillin' with with crew (yeah)
Let me know if you see me
Hey girl you know I see you
Been doin' this for months now but still feels brand new
How you cool as December but still hotter than June

Put me in your plans girl
Come and gimme your hand girl
Why you standin' up on the wall

You know you should give me a dance girl

And even though you're lookin' fly on the wall you aint gotta be a fly on the wall

Shawty run and tell the DJ
Put it on replay
It's officially party time
Run and tell the DJ
Do what we say
Turn it up till the end of the night
I know that every time we're together
We say it couldn't get any better
but it's gotta be the
Best Night Ever
Best Night Ever
Best Night Ever
Rolex on a G5
Funny how time flies and by the way smilin' girl
I'm doin' something right
Baby you a star, girl you shinin' so bright
You the reason i'm rocking my Ray Bans at night

Put me in your plans girl

Come and gimme your hand girl
Why you standin' up on the wall

You know you should give me a dance girl

And even though you're looking fly on the wall
You ain't gotta be a fly on the wall

Shawty run and tell the DJ

There's so many girls up in this room
But girl I got my eyes on you
T-t-t-tell let's go
You're super dope we turnin' up it's party we burnin' up woah
For really, you pretty know you got what every guy here wants
Girl gimme and chance and put your number in my phone
I'll give you a call
I'll give you it all
I'll give you my heart if you're willing to fall in love by the end of this song
Sh-sh-sh-shawty
