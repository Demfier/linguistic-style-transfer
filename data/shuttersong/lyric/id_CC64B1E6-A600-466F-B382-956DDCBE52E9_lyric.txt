You're stuck in my head
Stuck in my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go, get outta here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away, I'd run away with you ooh

This is the part
You gotta say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'd run away with you ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you ooh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Up in the clouds
High as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay, I wanna stay with you ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you ooh

Oh baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Oh baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Hold on to me
I never wanna let you go ooh (Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold ooh (Run away with me, run away with me)

We could turn the world to gold

Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold ooh ooh

Oh my baby, take me to the feeling (take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me (Just run away with me)
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Run away with me, run away with me
Run away with me, run away with me
