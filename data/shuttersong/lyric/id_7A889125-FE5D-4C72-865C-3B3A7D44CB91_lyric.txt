This is a song,
About my pain,
About my suffering.

I was born,
Divided,

My dick is so tiny.

I have to make love,
With the lights out,
And even then,
I hear snickering.

So I am nice,
I cuddle,
I kiss you gently,
And treat you like a queen.

Other guys,
They don't have to try,
Because they're well endowed.

Walking proud,
They scream it loud,
You're better than me,
You're better than me.

Rod: Hey this really isn't doing anything for me can we go ahead and pull out the toys?
Vo: Sure, no problem, that doesn't hurt my feelings or anything.
Rod: Yeah well that's just it I'm feeling nothing so can you just get something to help?
Vo: You know what? Why don't we just take a box cutter and cut my d off because it's obviously useless.
Rod: Are you serious? Because then you could be like my girlfriend and that would be awesome.
Vo: Yeah sure I don't mind being a girl I mean I was practically born one.
Rod: OH MY GOD! I'm so excited, but do you mind if I go ahead and start dating a real man now?
Vo: Yeah, I mean, we can just be friends, whatever.
Rod: Cool.

You don't have to, pretend to be horny anymore.
You don't have to, like my penis anymore.

Bloody box cutter,
My bloody box cutter,
Look at my blood box cutter,
My bloody.

Rod: Hey, can you go ahead and get out? I'm gonna have sex with my new boyfriend.
Vo: Did you want my microp as a suvenier?
Rod: Yeah no you can just throw it in the garbage disposal on your way out.
Vo: Ok then... I hope you guys have a great time together.

Now let's end this song, with a really long moaning.

Rod: I said, get out!
Vo: Oh, sorry, bye.'
