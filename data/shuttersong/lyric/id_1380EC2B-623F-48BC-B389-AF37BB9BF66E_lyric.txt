The heart is a bloom\n Shoots up through the stony ground\n There's no room\n No space to rent in this town\n You're out of luck\n And the reason that you had to care\n The traffic is stuck\n And you're not moving anywhere\n You thought you'd found a friend\n To take you out of this place\n Someone you could lend a hand\n In return for grace\n It's a beautiful day\n Sky falls you feel like\n It's a beautiful day\n Don't let it get away\n You're on the road\n But you've got no destination\n You're in the mud\n In the maze of her imagination\n You love this town\n Even if that doesn't ring true\n You've been all over\n And it's been all over you\n It's a beautiful day\n Don't let it get away\n It's a beautiful day\n Touch me\n Take me to that other place\n Teach me\n I know I'm not a hopeless case\n See the world in green and blue\n See China right in front of you\n See the canyons broken by cloud\n See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out\n See the Bedouin fires at night\n See the oil fields at first light\n And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth\n After the flood all the colors came out\n It was a beautiful day\n Don't let it get away\n Beautiful day\n Touch me\n Take me to that other place\n Reach me\n I know I'm not a hopeless case\n What you don't have you don't need it now\n What you don't know you can feel it somehow\n What you don't have you don't need it now\n Don't need it now\n Was a beautiful day
