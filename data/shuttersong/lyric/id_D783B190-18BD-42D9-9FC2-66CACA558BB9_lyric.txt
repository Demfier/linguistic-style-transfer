If I love ya love me right Back
The kind of love that keep you comin' back
If I love ya love me right back

Don't ever leave me, girl don't do me that

So please (stay!), don't walk (away!)
Gimme another chance, mi love you the right (way!)
My true feelings pushing up
Woman, you luv me, can't do without
Who am I without you by my side?
Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark
Wishin' I could hold you now...
When you were here for me, I was not there for you

I was too blind, couldn't see what you did for me
Now I don't know what to do
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be right here for you
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be calling out for you, can you hear me?
(Toca toca latino!)

And every time that you think to leave
I'll be don't don't don't don't go
And every time that you think of me
I'll want your big bright smile, just go
There's no-one else but you, girl
And when mi look at mi future, see you, girl
