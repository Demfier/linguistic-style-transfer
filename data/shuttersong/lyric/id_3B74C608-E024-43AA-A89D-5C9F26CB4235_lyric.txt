I like them LA LA

I like them LA LA

I met this girl, late last year

She said don¡¯t you worry if I disappear

I told her I¡¯m not really looking for another mistake

Called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait

And then I jump right in a week later in turn

A record she was only looking for a lover to burn

But I gave her my time, for two or three nights

Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

And then, I wait 4 months until our paths crossed again

She told me I was never looking for a FRIEND

Maybe you can swing by my room around 10

And you can bring a lemon and a bottle of gin

We¡¯ll be in the sheets till the late AM

Baby if you wanted me you should¡¯ve just said

She singing I like them LA LA

Don¡¯t f-ck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my arms

I don¡¯t wanna know that babe

I like them LA LA

Don¡¯t f-ck with my love

And so that she knows

Take aim and reload

I don¡¯t wanna know that babe

I like them LA LA

And a couple weeks after only wanna see her

We took away the days with a take away pizza

Before a text message was the only way to reach her

Now she¡¯s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Swinging at a reaper

Fall over the trap like a preacher

Never wants to see that guess I don¡¯t want to either

But me and her we make money the same way,

Four cities, 2 planes the same day

And those shows have never been what it¡¯s about

Maybe we¡¯ll go together and just figure it out!!

Put on a film and sit with you on the couch

But if you get on a plane we¡¯ll be missing it now

We should¡¯ve written it out, the way things played out

But she was kissing him out, I was confused about

She should figure it out while I¡¯m sat here

Singing I like them LA LA

Don¡¯t f-ck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my arms

I don¡¯t wanna know that babe

I like them LA LA

(knock knock knock) on my hotel door

I don¡¯t even know if she knows what for

She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya

Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be NEXT

But sweetie you didn¡¯t need to take him to bed, THAT'S ALL

And I never saw him as a threat

Until you disappeared with him to have sex

Of course, it¡¯s not we were both on tour

We were staying on the same f-cking hotel floor

And I wasn¡¯t looking for a promise or commitment,

but it wasn¡¯t never just run and I thought you were DIFFERENT

This is not the way you realize

You wanted it¡¯s a bit too much too late in my mind

All this time god knows I¡¯m singing

Don¡¯t f-ck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my arms

I don¡¯t wanna know that babe

I like them LA LA

Don¡¯t fuck with my love

And so that she knows

Take aim & reload

I don¡¯t wanna know that babe

I like them LA LA

Don¡¯t f-ck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my arms

I don¡¯t wanna know that babe

I like them LA LA

Don¡¯t fuck with my love

And so that she knows

Take aim and reload

I don¡¯t wanna know that babe
