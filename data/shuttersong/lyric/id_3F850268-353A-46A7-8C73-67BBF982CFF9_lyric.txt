I like the way you look in my town
I like the way you look in my street
I like the way you look in my house
I like the way you look in my sheets
I like the way you taste with a drink
I like the way you taste with a smile
I like the way you taste when I sing
I like it when it's been a while
I like it when it's been a while
Our night is lit by the city moon
When I see myself reflect on you
I know what I was meant to do
We're alive, alive We're aviation high
I find myself countin' the days
I find myself countin' your lashes
I think I memorized your face
But then again who hasn't
Moments when you say what you should
Moments when you say something better
Feels so good I wish you would
Keep on saying them forever
Keep on saying them forever
Our night is lit by the city moon
When I see myself reflect on you
I know what I was meant to do
We're alive, alive We're aviation high
Don't wake me up when you're leavin'
Cause I wanna keep on dreamin' of this
We're alive, alive We're aviation high
We're aviation high
