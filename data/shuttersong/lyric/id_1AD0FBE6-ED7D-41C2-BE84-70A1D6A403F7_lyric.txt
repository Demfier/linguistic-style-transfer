KISS ME TOO FIERCELY
HOLD ME TOO TIGHT
I NEED HELP BELIEVING
YOU'RE WITH ME TONIGHT
MY WILDEST DREAMINGS
COULD NOT FORESEE
LYING BESIDE YOU
WITH YOU WANTING ME

AND JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE
I'VE LOST ALL RESISTANCE
AND CROSSED SOME BORDERLINE
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
IT'S OVER TOO FAST
I'LL MAKE EV'RY LAST MOMENT LAST
AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE...

MAYBE I'M BRAINLESS
MAYBE I'M WISE
BUT YOU'VE GOT ME SEEING
THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES
SOMEHOW I'VE FALLEN
UNDER YOUR SPELL
AND SOMEHOW I'M FEELING
IT'S "UP" THAT I FELL ...
BOTH
EVERY MOMENT
 AS  LONG  AS  YOU 'RE  MINE
I'LL WAKE UP MY BODY
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME...
FIYERO
SAY THERE'S NO FUTURE
FOR US  AS A PAIR ...
BOTH
AND THOUGH I MAY KNOW
I DON'T CARE бн
JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
 AS  LONG  AS  YOU 'RE  MINE
COME BE HOW  YOU WANT TO
AND SEE HOW BRIGHT WE SHINE
BORROW THE MOONLIGHT
UNTIL IT IS THROUGH
AND KNOW I'LL BE HERE HOLDING  YOU
 AS  LONG  AS  YOU 'RE  MINE...
(Fiyero studies her face.)

It's just-- for the first time, I feel wicked.
 As  Long  As  You  Are  Mine
in
Wicked
