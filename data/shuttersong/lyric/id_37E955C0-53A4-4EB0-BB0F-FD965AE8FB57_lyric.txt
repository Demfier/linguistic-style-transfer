I've got a question tell me why, you always fall for the bad guy
Its 'cuz you like it, yeah you like it 
When I look at other girls as they walking by I say hello 'cuz you don't mind it
I think you like it, I don't know why you like it
By the way last week Saturday, was our anniversary, I was playing GTA
Damn I'm sorry 

Would you love me, would you love me, if I wasn't such a jerk 
But you love me, yeah you love me, 'cuz you like it when it hurts 
Try to be over nice, but it doesn't seem to work 
Would you tell me, that you love me, if I wasn't such a jerk 
(I DON'T THINK SO!!)
(I DON'T THINK SO!!)

I used to treat you, like a queen, it never worked out right for me
You didn't like it, you never liked it 
I know your parents hate my life, but it always seems to make you smile, because you like it
I guess you like it I don't know why you like it 
By the way, coming up on Saturday, isn't it your birthday, I'll be playing GTA
Damn I'm sorry

Would you love me, would you love me, if I wasn't such a jerk

(I DON'T THINK SO!!)
(I DON'T THINK SO!!)

Would you love me, would you love me, if I wasn't such a jerk 
But you love me, yeah you love me, 'cuz you like it when it hurts 
When you tell me baby listen, I got something I need to say, all I hear is 
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH...

Would you love me, would you love me, if I wasn't such a jerk 
But you love me, yeah you love me, 'cuz you like it when it hurts
