Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers,
Yes we could be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers,
Yes we should be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)

Go down in history
Go down together, into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra
Your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers,
Yes we could be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers,
Yes we should be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)

Legen-legendary lovers
Legen-legendary lovers
Legen-legendary lovers
Ohh
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers,
Yes we could be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers,
Yes we should be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers,
Yes we could be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers,
Yes we should be, legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
