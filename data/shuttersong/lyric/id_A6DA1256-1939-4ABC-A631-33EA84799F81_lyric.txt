Some people all about the dolla bill
It's quite a shame that ain't really how you oughta feel
It's all the same, every day, how you gotta deal
With all the pain, but in time it is gonna heal
We never change for anybody that would just be insane
Light a flame, rock it back and forth, let me take you away
With my words, I heard someone kicked it to the curb
Keep your head held high, like you're chiefin' on the herb
It's absurd the way the dolla bill rules life
Two types of people on this earth, who's right?
One side's controlled by material things
The others live for experience and everything it brings
I'm the king of the latter, sing about what matters
At the ball park with my friends swing batta batta
Just another summers day, watch the sun fade away
All I gotta say is we'll never change
Get away from it all not a care in the world
Watch the sun hit the water as the waves curl
No plans but a drink in my hand
No shoes, no shirt, swimsuit, ray bans
Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding
Come on baby girl the water's fine just dive in
Ain't a dream so open your eyes, we're just living
in paradise
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Swear we'll never change
So come with me, come with me
Beach sides where we're gonna be
Smiling and enjoying the world that we're living in
Party on an island somewhere in the Caribbean
Somewhere tropical underneath the hot sun
Not a worry in the world we ain't got one
Shotgun another brew by the deep blue
Never going home 'cause we really don't need to
I'm feeling irie, congo line right behind me
We getting lively chillin' in Hawaii
Yeah taking shots like Kyrie
Take a couple more now you in my league
Come vibe with me, get high with me
I know we don't know each other's names
Where we wanna be, blue skies and sea
Yeah, we'll never change
Get away from it all not a care in the world
Watch the sun hit the water as the waves curl
No plans but a drink in my hand
No shoes, no shirt, swimsuit, ray bans
Get away from it all no one knows where we're
hiding
Come on baby girl the water's fine just dive in
Ain't a dream so open your eyes, we're just living
in paradise
We're never changing, we'll stay the same and
We'll never change at all
We're never changing, we'll stay the same and
We'll never change at all
Get away from it all not a care in the world
Watch the sun hit the water as the waves curl
No plans but a drink in my hand
No shoes, no shirt, swimsuit, ray bans
Get away from it all no one knows where we're
hiding
Come on baby girl the water's fine just dive in
Ain't a dream so open your eyes, we're just living
in paradise
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Swear we'll never change
Just me and you
We're just living in paradise.
