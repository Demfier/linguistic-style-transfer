[Harry:]
I wanna write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song

[Liam:]
I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You'll have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

[Louis:]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Liam:]
I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink
You know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

[Louis:]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Harry:]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Niall:]
I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a song
