We were coastin' on a coast when you opened my eyes
Made me notice where the ocean is holdin' the sky, bright
I was blinded, your smile shinin' behind those green eyes
The horizon so enticing please say you'll be mine

Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything it seems that you are
The truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far

My afternoon dream when
The world is speeding
I am still sleepin'
In my blue dream and
I know the meanin'
For all the seasons
You are the reason
My love

My mind is open
So hard since you came inside
I feel so alive
Without you life just passes by
Passes by, passes by

Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything it seems that you are
The truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far

My afternoon dream when
The world is sleepin'
I am still thinkin'
Of my blue dream
It's, bliss
Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything it seems that you are
The truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far
My afternoon dream when
The world is sleepin'
I am still thinkin'
Of my blue dream
It's, bliss
