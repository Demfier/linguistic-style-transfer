I see what you're wearing
There's nothing beneath it
Forgive me for staring
Forgive me for breathing

We might not know why
We might not know how
But baby, tonight
We're beautiful now

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

We might not know why
We might not know how
But baby, tonight
We're beautiful now

We'll light up the sky
We'll open the clouds
'Cause baby, tonight
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful

We're beautiful

Wherever it's going
I'm gonna chase it
What's left of this moment
I'm not gonna waste it

Stranded together
Our worlds have collided
This won't be forever
So why try to fight it?

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

We might not know why
We might not know how
But baby, tonight
We're beautiful now

We'll light up the sky
We'll open the clouds
'Cause baby, tonight
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful

We're beautiful

Let's live tonight like fireflies
And one by one, light up the sky
We disappear and pass the crown
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now (beautiful)
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful

We're beautiful
We're beautiful now

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

We're beautiful
