(Beau Brooks)
I'm never gonna pick up baby go ahead and give up cause
You're never gonna get a second chance
You weren't even wasted when you said I'd never make it

So, I guess I gotta prove that I'm the man
You treat me like a hobby and you're telling everybody
That you didn't really love me like that
I'm about to change my number and I bet that you're gonna wonder why

I never ever called your ass back
(Luke Brooks)
You're gonna miss me when my song's on the radio

You're gonna hate this freakin song
It goes like:
(The Janoskians)
La da da da da da
You said you loved me
La da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da

I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You're gon' hate this freakin song
(Jai Brooks)

I don't think you get it but I meant it when I said it
That you're never gonna get a second try
You said I was a zero but I'm gonna be a hero when I
Hit the red button every time
(Luke Brooks)

You're gonna miss my when my song's on the radio
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
I just can't wait until you hear me on the stereo
You're gonna hate this freakin song
It goes like:
(The Janoskians)
La da da da da da
You said you loved me

La da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You're gon' hate this freakin song
(James Yammouni)
You told me I was gonna flop baby
And get a job baby

And I was never gonna live in my dreams
So baby, don't despair cause I see you

When you show up at my shows
You screwed up cause I blew up
And you blew up my phone
That's Karma
(Luke Brooks)
