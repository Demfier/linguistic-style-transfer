You know you're not the only one
To see the boy that you hold very close to you
He's not your kind of guy, I hope you realise

I have no care for answers, 'cause now you're standing lonely next to me
Oh oh
So take me on a tangent, 'cause tangible is something we perceive
Oh oh

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire
Nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history

From a retrospective point of view
It's time to reinvent
Don't care to what extent

Subconsious disarray
I want to look away
I'll live for shadow-play

I can't tell the difference
When everyone's pretending to play ball
Oh oh

Now I'm all for resistence
But I can't take it anymore
Oh oh

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire
Nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire
Nothing to desire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history
Finally we can be part of history

I told you
I told myself
It's alright
Alright
Alright

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire
Nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire
Nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older
Finally we can be part of history
Finally we can be part of history
