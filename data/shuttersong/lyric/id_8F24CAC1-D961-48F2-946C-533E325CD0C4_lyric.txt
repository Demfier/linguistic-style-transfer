We were never meant to be quiet

I'm on the edge got to get away
I've seen it all before
I'm going down like a renegade
And I'm still begging for more

This is the last time I tell you to open your eyes
The city is sleeping, the monster's outside
The fire is burning, there's nowhere to hide
And I won't say it anymore

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet

There are lights that'll lead the way
To what we're searching for
A million miles from yesterday
And it's right here on the floor

This is the last time I tell you to open your eyes
The city is sleeping, the monster's outside
The fire is burning, there's nowhere to hide
And I won't say it anymore

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet
