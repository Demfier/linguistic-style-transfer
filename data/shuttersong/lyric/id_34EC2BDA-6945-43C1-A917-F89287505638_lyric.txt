Not sure when I'm gonna be back
State lines don't know where I'm at
Who can say how you'll react
When I tell you I'm leaving

Like a fire craves the rain
Like a beggar hopes for change
Like a flood needs to drain
I only need one thing

Point me in your direction
I'm halfway
There is a misconception of what
It really isn't this disconnection an excuse
Don't make it easy for me to forget you

Not sure when I'm gonna be home
Lonely hearts they start to roam
I hate to miss you on the telephone
Always feels like I'm leaving you

Like a fire craves the rain
Like a beggar hopes for change
Like a flood needs to drain
I only need one thing

Point me in your direction
I'm halfway
There is a misconception of what
It really isn't this disconnection an excuse
Don't make it easy for me to forget you

Here comes the hardest part
Can you feel the beat from the farthest heart
Bring something back to life
Are you coming back

Are you coming back
Are you coming back
Are you coming back to me
Yeah

Point me in your direction
I'm halfway
There is a misconception of what
It really isn't this disconnection an excuse
Don't make it easy for me to forget you

Point me in your direction
I'm halfway
There is a misconception of what
It really isn't this disconnection an excuse
Don't make it easy for me to forget you
