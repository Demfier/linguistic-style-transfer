She falls asleep and all she thinks about is you
She falls asleep and all she dreams about is you
When she's asleep the air she's breathing is for you
Are why she wants to live
She's not got that much more to give

She sits alone, on her phone
She's calling about her broken home
And I don't know what I should say cause she's crying
And feels as though she's thrown it all away
She won't last another day

You're climbing the stairs, unaware that she's hurting
Bad and lying very still on the floor by the door
But it's locked 'cause she was hoping
You would come back for more
But it's too late to realize you've made mistakes

She falls asleep and all she thinks about is you
She falls asleep and all she dreams about is you
When she's asleep the air she's breathing is for you
Are why she wants to live
She's not got that much more to give

Please save me
I've been waiting,
Been aching for too long

She falls asleep and all she thinks about is you
She falls asleep and all she dreams about is you
When she's asleep the air she's breathing is for you
Are why she wants to live
She's not got that much more to give

Please save me
I've been waiting
