Lost myself again,
Didn't care,
I was missin',
Said goodbye to friends,
And drove away,

I just don't belong in a town,
Where no one listens,
Even if I'm wrong,
I'll find a way.

Gotta got away from here,
Find a way to disappear,
Say goodbye to everything and everyone I know,
Gotta go and leave this town,
All it does is bring me down,
I just wanna tell my friends no matter where I go,
I'll see them down the road,

Lost myself again,
No one new I was missing,
Said goodbye to dad,
And his new wife.

Studder around this lawn,
Now sick and tired of wishing,
Even if I'm wrong,
I'll still be right.

Gotta got away from here,
Find a way to disappear,
Say goodbye to everything and everyone I know,
Gotta go and leave this town,
All it does is bring me down,
I just wanna tell my friends no matter where I go,
I'll see them down the road.

I'm sick of dreaming,
I would rather stay up all night,
Live my own life,
Don't worry about me!

Gotta got away from here,
Find a way to disappear,
Say goodbye to everything and everyone I know,
Gotta go and leave this town,
All it does is bring me down,
I just wanna tell my friends no matter where I go,
I'll see them down the road
See 'em down the road,
I'll see 'em down the road,
(Lost myself again, didn't notice I was missin')
I'll seem 'em down the road.
