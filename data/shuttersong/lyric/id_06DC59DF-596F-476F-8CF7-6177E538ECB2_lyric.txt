
Mmmmm
Yeah
Yeah
Mmmmm


We are friends for life
Hold that deep inside
Let this be your drive
To survive


And just stand high and tall
Make sure you give your all
And if you ever fall
Know that I'm right here


We'll always be together
Don't you worry, oh
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry
Don't worry, no no no
The circle will never end
Just know that we'll meet again
And we'll always be together
Forever always, oh
I am here


Find me in the sky
Dancing with the moon and night
Your heartbeat is disguised as my
Lullaby


Be happy and know that I'm
Watching you travel far and wide
Waiting for us to meet again


We'll always be together
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
The circle will never end
It'll never ends
Just know that we'll meet again
We'll meet again
And we'll always be together
Forever always
Oh
I am here


If you need me, yeah
I'm in the wind
Look for me friend
I'm in the stars


When you need me
The heavens will send
A message within

Straight to your heart


Oh


We'll always be together
Don't you worry
Don't you worry, no.
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry
Never worry about a thing, no no no no no no no
The circle will never end
It'll never end
Just know that we'll meet again
We'll meet again
And we'll always be together
Forever always
Don't you worry
I am here
I am here
Yeah
I am here
I am here
