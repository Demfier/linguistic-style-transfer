You ready B?
You ready E?
Scotty?
Bring it down!

Girl I must warn you
I sense something strange in my mind
The situation is serious
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time

It's all so beautiful
Relationships they seem from the start
But it's all so deadly
When love is not together from the heart

Oh, it's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it out of my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her

That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and a smile
That girl is poison, woooh

If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I start to meet a fly girl
Because in some portion
You'll think she's the best thing in the world

'Cause she's so fly
She'll drive you right out of your mind
And steal your heart and when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin', demon,

Poison, deadly, movin it slow
Lookin for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Gettin paid, laid, you better lay low
Schemin on house, money, and the whole show
The low pro hoe she'll be cut like an afro
What you're sayin'now, she's a winner to you
But I know she's a loser,
Me and the crew used to do her!

Poison,
Never trust a big butt and a smile
That girl is poison, yes she is

I am the bar, shake, breakin and takin 'em all
That night, I played the wall
Check out the fellas, the highs and lows
Keep one eye open, clockin' the hoes
One particular girl she stood out from the rest
Poison as can be, high power chest
Bivins we're now runnin' this show
Bell, Biv DeVoe
Now you know.
Yo, Slick, blow.

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it out of my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her

That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and a smile
That girl is poison, heeeey, woooh, hey

Poison, poison, p-p-p-poison, woohohohoh
Poison, poison, p-p-p-poison, woohohohohoh
Poison, poison, p-p-p-poison, woooh,
Poison, poison, p-p-p-poison.
