Yeah, I knew I knew I knew
Back when we were in school
All of the crazy things that we used to get in to
But soon, all I am going to remember are the memories that left me torn, tattered, and bruised.
Sick sound in the background is putting my mind at ease helping me unwind and easily breath
I guess I'll go grab my keys and just drive into the night with a Baggie of trees
Lay back, lay back with a view that you would be amazed at
Looking up in the sky the way colors perfectly intertwine gives me a feeling that is so sublime and I...

I knew yeah, I knew, baby girl, yeah I knew
I knew yeah, I knew, baby girl, yeah I knew

Let go we're watching all let this beat inside and take control
Get off the road you're into a place nobody knows go on breath
Let your mind wonder thinking all these thoughts that you always fonder
Come with me, come with me

I knew yeah, I knew, baby girl yeah, I knew
I knew yeah, I knew, baby girl yeah, I knew

Aye, it's funny the way that people give up right after they make a mistake
If you relate to the things that I say, than tell me to whoever you can for goodness sakes
When writing my words I rapidly learn esthetic perfection is needed like insulin for a diabetic
You better think it's me, well now you will regret it
I'm fed up with all the fakes behind the back, talk there's the exit
It's right behind me, choose your words wisely, never be encancerous always speakin benignly
Aye, well maybe that's just how I am
Laid back no one ever gave a damn
Taking life as it goes all the highs and the lows
Opinions don't matter once you leave the people you know
Just do whatever makes you glad, I'll always thinks about the days we had

I knew yeah, I knew, baby girl yeah, I knew
I knew yeah, I knew, baby girl yeah, I knew
