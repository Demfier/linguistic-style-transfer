I didn't lose my focus when you caught me so off guard like that
Tryin' not to look in the direction where you're standin' at
The tension in here is like a short little fuse
And I'ma light this up, I ain't got nothin' to lose, do you feel me?

I couldn't be more turnt when I am over here
Just dancin' with my girls, we're knockin' over chairs
And rippin' at our shirts, gettin' so slizzard
While we dishing up this dirt

And we don't care if we'll be seen
Everyone's jittering
Voulez-vous danser avec moi?
Do you wanna mix with me?
(Tout le monde est jittering)
I like what you got goin' on

Want to see you jitter
Want to, want to, w-want to jitter
Want to, want to, w-want to
Want to, w-want to
Jitter, jitter, want to, want to, w-want to jitter

Woah it got crazy really quick
All these kids are lunatics
Got the jitters up in this
And I might have to call it quits
Don't know how I'm gettin' home
Can somebody ring my phone?
Now I lost you, where'd you go?
And damn that girl looks like a...
Can't find my crew, I was lookin' at you
And the DJ's at it again
Well I lost all my shit in your bag of tricks
And I wish I could find a pen
To write my name on your hand
Take my number, ladies' man
Dance with me

I couldn't be more turnt when I am over here
Just dancin' with my girls, we're knockin' over chairs
And rippin' at our shirts, gettin' so slizzard
While we dishin' up this dirt

And we don't care if we'll be seen
Everyone's jittering
Voulez-vous danser avec moi?
Do you wanna mix with me?

I like what you got goin' on

You say nothing's wrong with growing up too fast
The more you speak, the more you act like being young won't last
And I won't ever forget the day you told me how I should behave
I'm gonna make my own dance cause I'm not too old for that
