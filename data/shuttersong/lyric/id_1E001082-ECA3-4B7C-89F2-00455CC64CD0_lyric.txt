For your consideration,
I offer myself with no sign of hesitation.
Lets get these wheels in motion
Cuz this old guitar's gonna sing by the oceanside.
Oh Apple you're my life.

Feel like a before and after photo
How I've lived without you I don't know.
So we gonna plant the seed and watch it grow

Oh Apple, you don't even know
How your laughter tastes so sweet
Oh Apple, well I thank my stars that you fell so close
You fell so close, that you fell so close to me.

We sit and watch as the waves slowly reach for our names
And surrender them to the time
If I could send out a message in a bottle,
I'd say all I need is here by my side
Oh Apple you're the reason why.

Feel like a before and after photo
How I've lived without you I don't know.
So we gonna plant the seed and watch it grow

Oh Apple, you don't even know
How your laughter tastes so sweet
Oh Apple, well I thank my stars that you fell so close
You fell so close, that you fell so close to me.

Oh Apple, you don't even know
How your laughter tastes so sweet
Oh Apple, well I thank my stars that you fell so close
You fell so close to me.

Oh Apple, you don't even know
How your laughter tastes so sweet
Oh Apple, well I thank my stars that you fell so close
You fell so close, that you fell so close to me.
