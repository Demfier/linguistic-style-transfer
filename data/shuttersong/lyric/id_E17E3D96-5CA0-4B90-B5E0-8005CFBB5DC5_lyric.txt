I guess right now you've got the last laugh
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listening no I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance don't ask I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back please enjoy your party
I'll be here somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh here oh here
Oh I asked myself what am I doing here
Oh here oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners I hope you understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh god why am I here
Oh here oh here
Oh I asked myself what am I doing here
Oh here oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking about her haters she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this I should never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the tv with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh here oh here
Oh I asked myself what am I doing here
Oh here oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here
