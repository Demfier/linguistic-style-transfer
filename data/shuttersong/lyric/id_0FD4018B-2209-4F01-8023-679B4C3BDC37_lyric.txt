And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh oh
When it's just me and my girls

[Camila:]
All the lights, turn them off
It's too loud in here to talk
I don't understand a word you say

[Normani:]
Gotta sleep but instead
Karaoke on the bed
Taking duck face selfies right and left

[Lauren:]
We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it
We don't care if people stare
When we wobble with it

[Ally:]
We get diva on it
We get Queen Bee on it, yeah
We get Britney, Demi, One Direction, Bieber on it

And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh oh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
Watch me now
Me and my girls

[Ally:]
My voice is gone, got my favorite PJ's on
Times like this don't always come along

[Dinah:]
You're all I need, there's nowhere I'd rather be
Than to have you crazy freaks with me

[Lauren:]
We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it
We don't care if people stare
When we wobble with it

[Ally:]
We get diva on it
We get Queen Bee on it, yeah
We get Britney, Demi, One Direction, Bieber on it

And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like ooh ooh oh
When it's just me and my girls
Watch me now
Me and my girls

Break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
Now break it down
[Repeat]

And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like ooh ooh ooh
When it's just me and my girls
Watch me now.
