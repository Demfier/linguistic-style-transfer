And well, I think I've gone mad
Isn't that so sad?
And what a shame, you've lost a brain that you never had
Oh mum, check the car
It can't have gone far
I must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
It's likely in a Sainsbury's
Flirting with the girls and waiting for me
I jumped on a bus, declared my name
Asked if anybody had seen my brain
The brain was last seen going for a run
And would you sign an autograph for my daughter, Laura?
Cause she adores ya, but I think you're shit
I've gotta look for my brain for a bit
I stepped outside, it hurt my eyes
Well, what do you expect when you've got no mind?
I searched all day, it drove me insane

Where would I be if I was my brain?

The nurse told me she felt my pain
But she couldn't find a single trace of my brain
'Oops I Did It Again' started playing
Forget my brain, remember my pain
