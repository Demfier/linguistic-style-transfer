Photograph - Ed Sheeran\n Loving can hurt \n Loving can hurt sometimes\n But it's the only thing that I know\n When it gets hard \n You know it can get hard sometimes\n It's the only thing\n That makes us feel alive\n We keep this love in a photograph\n We made these memories\n For ourselves\n Where our eyes are never closing\n Our hearts were never broken\n And time's forever frozen  still\n So you can keep me\n Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans\n Holding me close until our eyes meet\n You won't ever be alone \n Wait for me to come home\n Loving can heal \n Loving can mend your soul\n And it's the only thing that I know\n I swear it will get easier \n Remember that with every piece of ya\n And it's the only thing we take\n With us when we die\n We keep this love in a photograph\n We made these memories for ourselves\n Where our eyes are never closing\n Our hearts were never broken\n And time's forever frozen  still\n So you can keep me\n Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans\n Holding me close until our eyes meet\n You won't ever be alone\n And if you hurt me\n That's okay baby  there'll be worse things\n Inside these pages you just hold me\n And I won't ever let you go\n Wait for me to come home\n Wait for me to come home\n Wait for me to come home\n Wait for me to come home\n You can keep me\n Inside the necklace you bought\n When you were sixteen\n Next to your heartbeat\n Where I should be\n Keep it deep within your soul\n And if you hurt me\n That's okay baby  there'll be worse things\n Inside these pages you just hold me\n And I won't ever let you go\n When I'm going \n I will remember how you kissed me\n Under the lamppost back on Sixth street\n Hearing you whisper through the phone\n Wait for me to come home
