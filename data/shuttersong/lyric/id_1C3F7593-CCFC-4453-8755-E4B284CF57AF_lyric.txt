 Singing in rain, living  in fidelity, gently
romancing down
and if you're done feeling chances anyway
open new lenses, make a mess of her
open new lenses, make a mess of dreams
Twee de da da
 singing and live, living  in fidelity, gently
romancing down
and if you're done feeling chances anyway
we live somewhere, many doubt you anyway
