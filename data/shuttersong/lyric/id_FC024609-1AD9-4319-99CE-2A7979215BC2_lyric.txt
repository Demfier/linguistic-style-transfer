Oh I beg you
Can I follow?
Oh I ask you
Why not always?
Be the ocean
Where I unravel
Be my only
Be the water where I'm wading

You're my river running high
Run deep run wild

I, I follow
I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow
I follow you, dark doom honey
I follow you

He is a message
I'm the runner
He's the rebel
I'm the daughter waiting for you

You're my river running high
Run deep run wild

I, I follow
I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow
I follow you, dark doom honey
I follow you

Oh oh ohohoh, oh-oh-oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh, oh oh oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh, oh-oh-oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh, oh oh oh ohohoh

You're my river running high
Run deep run wild

I, I follow
I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow
I follow you, dark boom honey
I follow you

I, I follow
I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you.
I, I follow
I follow you, dark boom honey
I follow you.
Oh oh ohohoh, oh-oh-oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh, oh oh oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh, oh-oh-oh ohohoh
Oh oh ohohoh, oh oh oh ohohoh
