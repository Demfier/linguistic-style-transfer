I'm 5 years old, it's getting cold I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh & look up smiling at you I run & run
Past the pumpkin patch & the tractor rides up now the sky is gold
I hug your legs & fall asleep I'm going home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall

But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm 13 now & don't know how my friends could be so mean

I come home crying & you hold me tight & grab the keys
And we drive & drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk & window shop 'til I forgot all their names
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school

But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
I have an excellent father

His strengh is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside & out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house & I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found from back when I was 3

You set up a paint set in the kitchen & you're talkin' to me
It's the age of princesses & pirate ships & the 7 dwarves
And Daddy's smart & you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine and
I didn't know if you knew, so I'm takin' this chance to say
that I had the best day with you today
