Let it go

Let it go

Can't hold you back anymore

Let it go

Let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

The snow blows white on the mountain tonight

Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the Queen

The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside

Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see

Be the good girl

You always had to be

Conceal, don't feel

Don't let them know

Well, now they know

Let it go

Let it go

Can't hold you back anymore

Let it go

Let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand, and here I'll stay

Let it go

Let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance

Makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me

Can't get to me at all

Up here in the cold thin air

I finally can breathe

I know i left a life behind but I'm to relieved to grieve

Let it go

Let it go

Can't hold you back anymore

Let it go

Let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I'll stay

Let it go

Let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway

Standing frozen in the life I've chosen

You won't find me, the past is so behind me

Buried in the snow

Let it go

Let it go

Can't hold you back anymore

Let it go

Let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I'll stay

Let it go

Let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway

na na na na na na
na na na na na na
Let it go na na na

you go

Let it go

Let it go

Let it go
