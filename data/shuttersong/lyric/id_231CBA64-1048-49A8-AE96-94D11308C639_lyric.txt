Red rose, so attractive
Bleeding broken feelings
In this shade of hate
Your colour turns to black
New dawn enlight my wrong thoughts
Make blind my weakness
Align the astral conscience
To my old strength
Outside, no ways need to be found
Change of visual
Inside, find the deepest contact
With your soul
A face that hides a secret
Dark lying mirror
An always hidden whisper
Revealing truth
SENSATION, EMOTION
DEEP FEELING, TRUE DEVOTION
SUPREME LOVE, SUPREME HATE
DIVINE CHOICE FOR A NEW FATE
Symptoms of viral illness
Hard to challenge
Closed eyes tired to see the
Red rose turning black
A never-ending try
To escape myself
While there still lies the mirror
And something more
SENSATION, EMOTION
DEEP FEELING, TRUE DEVOTION
SUPREME LOVE, SUPREME HATE
DIVINE CHOICE FOR A NEW FATE
