I know I won't stop if you give me the keys
'Cause I can drive it like a criminal
I won't watch if you want me to leave
'Cause I keep lookin' back for a miracle.
I'm just a lighter without a spark,
Take a bullet right straight through the heart,
Oh, I've made my mistakes,
But I won't let you walk away!
Please don't tell me you're gone 'cause
Please don't give it too long 'cause
Please don't tell me you're gone 'cause
Please, 'cause I won't let you walk away.
I got my windows down, getting lost in the breeze
And I feel like I'm causing a fairytale
I can't stop wanting you next to me
'Cause I keep holding up for a miracle.
I'm just a lighter without a spark,
Take a bullet right straight through the heart,
Oh, I've made my mistakes,
But I won't let you walk away!
I won't let you walk away!
I won't let you walk away
I won't let you walk away
I won't let you walk away!
