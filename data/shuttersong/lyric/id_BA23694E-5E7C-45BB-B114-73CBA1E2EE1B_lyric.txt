It's your love, you can't be for it tonight 
Feel me like you provide all this fire 
City light, believe in her light 
Take my hand and take me to sky 
and if we fallin' throw clouds 
Together we'll fly 
With all your spirit 
Let's travel, let's star tonight 
Take my hand and take me to sky 
And if we fallin'throw clouds 
Together we'll fly We will fly
