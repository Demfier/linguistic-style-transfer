Baby I - Ariana Grande
Baby I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don't know where to start
I love you more than anything
But the words cant even touch what's in my heart
When I try to explain it I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling
So I say baby baby  baby
Baby I (ooh baby  oh baby  my baby)
Baby I (ooh baby  baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Baby  baby ohohohoh
Baby I'm so down for you no matter what you do
(Real talk) I'll be around
See baby I been feelin' you
Before I knew what feelings were about
When I try to explain it I be sounding crazy
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say baby baby  baby
Baby I (ooh baby  oh baby  my baby)
Baby I (ooh baby  baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Baby  baby ohohohoh
Staright up you got me (all in)
How could I not be I sure hope you know
If it's even possible
I love you more
Than word love can say it
It's better not explaining that why I keep saying 
Baby I
Ooh baby  oh baby  my baby
Baby I (ooh baby  baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Baby  baby ohohohoh
Ooh baby ooh baby ooh baby baby I
Ooh baby Baby I
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Baby  baby
