Falling

We are falling now

Words written down

They are falling now

But the lies they will hurt you

Hold on

Human kindness desert you

Hold on

Let's start a revolution

How beautiful it is

Let's start a revolution

How beautiful it is (revolution)

Running with a crown on your head

A resolution

Written on your hands

And the lies they will hurt you

No more

Human kindness desert you

No more

Let's start a revolution

How beautiful it is

Let's start a revolution

How beautiful it is

City's on fire but it's beautiful

Revolution

City's on fire, won't you burn it all?

Revolution

City's on fire but it's beautiful

Revolution, revolution

Oh, oh, oh, revolution

Oh, oh, oh, revolution

Oh, oh, oh, revolution

Oh, oh, oh, revolution

Oh, oh, oh, revolution

Let's start a revolution

How beautiful it is

Let's start a revolution it is

Oh, oh, oh, revolution

Oh, oh, oh, revolution

Oh, oh, oh, revolution
