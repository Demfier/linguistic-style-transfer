Sunday Candy - Donnie Trumpet The Social Experiment
She could say in her voice in her way that she love me
With her eyes with her smile with her belt
With her hands with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is jesus christ and taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is hand made pan fried sun dried
Southside and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied president of my fan club saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my sunday candy
Come on in this house cause it's gonna rain
Rain down zion it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house cause it's gonna rain
Rain down zion it's gonna rain
I come to church for the candy your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin I came and sat in your pew
I come to christmas for dinner fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light gas water electricity rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singing his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher dream team team captain
Matter fact I ain't seen you in a minute
Let me take my butt to church
Come on in this house cause it's gonna rain
Rain down zion it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house cause it's gonna rain
Rain down zion it's gonna rain
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my sunday candy
Slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my sunday candy
Come on in this house cause it's gonna rain
Rain down zion it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house cause it's gonna rain
Rain down zion it's gonna rain
