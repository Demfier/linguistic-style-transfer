Good morning, you're leaving
I'll see you in the evening
My best friend till the end, my better half, no pretend
Our language is secret, no people try to solve it
New adventures on the way
You and me together,
Take on the world forever

I know all your secrets and I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling crueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
Woah oh, yeah, woah oh
We're clutzy, but so lucky that I always have you to catch me
We're partners in crime, you're stuck with me your whole life
So different, out of our minds from a planet that's hard to find

Every second, every day

You and me together,
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets and I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
You're right by my side whenever I need you, through the hardest times

I'll be there for you
At the crack of dawn, when the moon is gone

I won't be hard to find
'Cause you and me, oh yeah we're seamless
You and me together
Take on the world forever

I know all your secrets and I promise you I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah we're seamless
Woah oh, woah oh
