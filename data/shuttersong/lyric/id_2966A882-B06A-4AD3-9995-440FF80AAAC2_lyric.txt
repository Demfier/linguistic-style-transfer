I'm falling in,
I'm falling down.
I wanna begin
But I don't know how
To let you know,
How I'm feeling.
I'm high on hope.
I'm reeling.

And I won't let you go,
Now you know,
I've been crazy for you all this time.
I've kept it close
Always hoping
With a heart on fire,
A heart on fire.

Hand in hand,
Sparkling eyes.
The days are bright,
And so are the nights.
'Cause when I'm with you I'm grinning.
Once I was through
Now I'm winning.

And I won't let you go,
Now you know,
I've been crazy for you all this time.
I've kept it close
Always hoping
With a heart on fire,
A heart on fire.
A heart on fire,
A heart on fire.

Let me walk through life with you.
Everybody dreams of having what we do.
Like we're rolling thunder,
You pull me out from under.

No, I won't let you go,
Now you know,
I've been crazy for you all this time.
I've kept it close
Always hoping
With a heart on fire,
A heart on fire.
With a heart on fire,
A heart on fire.

A heart on fire.
