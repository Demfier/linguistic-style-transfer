We drove around in your car
But we didn't drive very far
Cause your tongue was in my mouth
and I'm thinking of someone else

I'm not making out with you
Even though I think your cute
I'm not making out with you
Cause you always make me blue

We were sitting in your room
And I wanted to leave soon
but you had to kiss my first
But in my head I thought of her

I'm not making out with you
Even though I think your cute
I'm not making out with you
Cause you always make me blue
