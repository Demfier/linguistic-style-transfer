Look at all the love that I've found
Zhivago, Zhivago (what have you done?)
Look at all the love that I've found
Zhivago, Zhivago (what have you done?)
I see the world
In shades of blue
Look at all the love that I've found
Without you
Zhivago
Now that we're done

Look at all the love that I've found
Zhivago, Zhivago
Look at all the love that I've found
Zhivago, Zhivago

I'm miles away
You never knew

Look at all the love that I've found
Without you
Zhivago
Now that we're done

I dreamt you were taken away
Zhivago
I let go

Look at all the love that I've found
Without you
Zhivago
Now that we're done

No
No
