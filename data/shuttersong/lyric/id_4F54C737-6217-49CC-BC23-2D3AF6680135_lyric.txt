How weird it is to think in 60 years
We won't exist and everyone
We've ever loved will just go on
The sun, the moon will shine above

And when we're deep beneath the ground
Our bodies vacant like the sound
Of empty space where we were born
The planets dancing all around

An eternity to drown
In a cemetery town
Is haunting me

The thing that hurts the most
The saddest part of all
Is you won't even know
That I'm missing you

Do angels sit up high in silver snow
I'll hope and pray but never know
Until they hold me by the hand
I may not ever understand

When i've lay here in my grave
The sun has grown until the day
It's warmth will splutter in the cold
The glow will finally fade away

An eternity to waste
And a cemetery fate
Is haunting me

The thing that i'll lament
What scares me half to death
Is you won't even get
That i'm missing you

I'm missing you

And i don't want to die,
I've told myself a lot of lies
But i fear my second death
When someone says my name for the last time

Darling don't you try
Don't you ever say that you wanted to
Oh i know that you wanted to

The strangest part of life
What keeps me up at night
Is you'll sleep sound despite
That i'm missing you.
