You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list
and checking it twice

Gonna find out, who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake

He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh you better watch out

You better not cry
You better not pout

To town
