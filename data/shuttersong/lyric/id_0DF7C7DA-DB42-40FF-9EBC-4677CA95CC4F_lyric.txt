WELL HOT DAMN!
\t\t

It's hard to tame the passion - THAT LEADS ME HERE
No Better choice
No stronger voice
And we'll sacrifice the fear

I've pushed through hesitation - IVE SEEN THROUGH DOUBT
I'm better now
Within her eyes
THEN I'LL EVER BE WITHOUT


We can push through
we are one in this
we are not Undone
WE ARE NOT UNDONE

We can push through
we are one in this
we are not Undone


I know my limitations - I'VE LEARNED FROM LIFE
THIS GREAT REWARD
I'M HONOR BOUND
Not Sacrifice, Not Price

I've found my inspiration - HELD IN BOTH HANDS
I'm Fully whole
In trust and care
I'm STRONGER

We can push through
we are one in this
we are not Undone
WE ARE NOT UNDONE

We can push through
we are one in this
we are not Undone
WE ARE NOT UNDONE

we are not undone
WE ARE NOT UNDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNEEEEEE!

(solo)

WE CAN PUSH THROUGH

we are one in this
we are not undone
WE ARE NOT UNDONE

we can push through
we are one in this
we are not undone
