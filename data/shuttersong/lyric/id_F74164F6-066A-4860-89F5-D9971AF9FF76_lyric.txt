The lights are low
Hot anticipation waiting for the show
Feel my heart is racing, losing all control
Got me so impatient for you
Yeah, yeah

'Cause in my mind
I see you touching me in ways undefined
I don't want to stop it
I gotta press rewind
So baby, tell me what we gon' do, gon' do

Oh
Don't you dare turn off the lights?
Let's make this last all night, yeah
Oh-I
Let's do it till the sky turns bright
Let's make this last all night

When you look into my eyes
The world stops and sparks fly
There's nothing sweeter than this paradise
Sing, oh
Babe, you set my love on fire
We can make this last all night

We can make this last all night
We can make this last all night
B-baby, baby, baby, baby
We can make this last all night
B-baby, baby, baby, baby

Mmm, feel this energy
Building up inside, it's like a sweet release
You play with this emotion, oh, so cleverly
You got me so addicted to you, to you

'Cause in my head
I know the night doesn't really have to end
I'm ready, steady, go, I am so prepared
For whatever you say, boy, I do, I do

Oh
Don't you dare turn off the lights?
Let's make this last all night, yeah
Oh-I
Let's do it till the sky turns bright
Let's make this last all night

When you look into my eyes
The world stops and sparks fly
There's nothing sweeter than this paradise
Sing, oh
Babe, you set my love on fire
We can make this last all night

We can make this last all night
We can make this last all night

We can make it
We can make it
We can make it
We can make this last all night

We can make it
We can make it
We can make it
We can make this last all night
