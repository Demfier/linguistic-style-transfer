Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is baste
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you - aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
For battles sucka - duck, crawl out the back
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
