Stay up late and think 
Of where you might be
I can't sleep I've got the image of you and him in the marquee
He made you smile when did I stop doing that?
Was it happening for a while?
You should've of just said
Instead I'm lying here wresting demons in my bed
Around and round we go
Demons in my bed

I don't mean to be so rude 
But next time you think you might not love someone
Don't you think it's best to tell them earlier on

Was he one of those whom you swore was just a friend
And did he used to send those messages through the night
Your screen would flash and in tone so brash
You'd say it's the time zone
And you're working late you're working too hard
You're working us to the ground
And I don't feel too sound
Is he better pound for pound?
You'll never know

I don't mean to be so rude 
But next time you think you might not love someone
Don't you think it's best to tell them earlier on

I don't mean to be so rude 
But next time you think you might not love someone
Don't you think it's best to tell them earlier on?
