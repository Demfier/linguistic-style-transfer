Missing You - All Time Low\n I heard that you've been\n Self medicating in the quiet of your room\n Your sweet  suburban tomb\n And if you need a friend\n I'll help you stitch up your wounds\n I heard that you've been\n Having some trouble finding your place in the world\n I know how much that hurts\n But if you need a friend\n Then please just say the word\n You've come this far\n You're all cleaned up\n You've made a mess again\n There's no more trying\n Time to sort yourself out\n Hold on tight\n This ride is a wild one\n Make no mistake\n The day will come when you can't cover up what you've done\n Now don't lose your fight  kid\n It only takes a little push to pull on through\n With so much left to do\n You'll be missing out  and we'll be missing you\n I heard that you've been\n Having some trouble finding your place in the world\n I know how much that hurts\n And if you need a friend\n Then please just say the word\n You've come this far\n You're all cleaned up\n You've made a mess again\n There's no more trying\n Time to sort yourself out\n Hold on tight\n This ride is a wild one\n Make no mistake\n The day will come when you can't cover up what you've done\n Now don't lose your fight  kid\n It only takes a little push to pull on through\n With so much left to do\n You'll be missing out  and we'll be missing you\n Grit your teeth  pull your hair\n Paint the walls black and scream  Fuck the world\n Cause it's my life  I'm gonna take it back\n And never for a second blame yourself\n Hold on tight\n This ride is a wild one\n Make no mistake\n The day will come when you can't cover up what you've done\n No  you can't cover up\n One  two  three  four\n Hold on tight\n This ride is a wild one\n Make no mistake\n The day will come when you can't cover up what you've done\n Now don't lose your fight  kid (Don't lose your fight  kid)\n It only takes a little push to pull on through\n With so much left to do\n You'll be missing out  and we'll be missing you\n
