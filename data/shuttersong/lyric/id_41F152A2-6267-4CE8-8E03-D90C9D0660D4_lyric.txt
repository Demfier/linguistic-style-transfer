I've seen every place
And pretty face
And then my heart they took
And now I've come to realize
There is nowhere left to look
And even when I'm struggling
Or can't seem to get by
You're right there by my side

I see every single message
You're send to my phone
And checking every photograph
Whenever you're alone
What I gotta do to show you
What you mean to me
It's not as easy as it seems

Don't know how to say it
There's no other way and
I'm telling you every single day
I don't want nobody nobody nobody nobody
But you you you

You're one of a kind
I'm losing my mind
I'm telling you
All the time
I don't want nobody nobody nobody nobody
But you you you
No-no-nobody but you

I've never needed someone else
As much as I need you
I'm letting go of all my fears
I've never seen the blues
And baby I'm still struggling
And trying to get by
But I know I'll be alright

So throw 'em up and knock 'em down
And get up out of my way
Cuz I'm running to your doorstep
And begging you to stay
Tell me what I gotta do to show you
What you mean to me
Oh you make my life complete

Don't know how to say it
There's no other way and
I'm telling you every single day
I don't want nobody nobody nobody nobody
But you you you

You're one of a kind
I'm losing my mind
I'm telling you
All the time
I don't want nobody nobody nobody nobody
But you you
No-no-nobody but you

Don't know how to say it
There's no other way
I'm telling you
Every single day
I don't want nobody but you

Oh you're one of a kind
I'm losing my mind
I'm telling all of the time
I don't want nobody
No-no-nobody but you
