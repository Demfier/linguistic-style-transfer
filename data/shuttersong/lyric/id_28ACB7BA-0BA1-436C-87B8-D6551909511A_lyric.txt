If you leave this time I'll feel that you be gone for good
So, I'll hold on like leaves in Fall to what is left
Said her father left her when she was young and
He said he'll be back with that same
tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do

Its safe to say your the only reason for it

I've been bleeding in your silence
I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God

must be mad with me it's coming
I'm confused who'll I'll spend my forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do

All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poke (and I poke) and I poked
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it Some more (some more)
And in my notepad, man I wrote (man I wrote)
If I dont have it, if I dont grab it
If I dont chip then a toe tag is, one last
Ima hope (ima hope) so iceberg
Dont float (dont float)
If I do manage to do damage to you
Dammit
It'd be grand, its ten grammies or my
Granite still standing
With a note (with a note) that read
"Granted, dont you panic"
When you make mistakes the most (the Most)
One day it'll make you grow (you grow)
When you outlandish and lose
Manners
To god you shall consult (consult)
When the bright cameras are still
Cramming
In your face and at provoke (provoke)
You to act manic, just stay planted
Cause your reapin what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and (and)
Keep a noose from round your throat and (and)
When you get mad and you poke at
It
When you poke at it just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when
You re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk titanic, duff giving to do a critic man?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when doves cry do
You hear em love?
(Do you hear em love? Do you hear em?)
And if my ship go down tell me who will
Abort?
And they won't let me live even when
Remorse that I give
When it goin rejoice and forgive, tell me
How I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even when I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
it seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the reason for it

All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
