It's been at least another year
And still I haven't got the chance to say
Always rolling off the tongue

Never said but nearly sung about a million ways
Every photograph and story
Trickled through the lengthy web of friends

I overthought but understood
Distant looks but looking good
And not the other way

But you, you fail to remember
But you, you fail to remember

Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time

With heat struck afternoons long through
Those idle dreams go back to you

The echo seems somewhat displaced
Every form that's of her face, I'm drifting off to

Bored of inflirtations
The rest was made of constellations that I've sought

Was this only in my head?
Just like most things go misread when overthought
But you, you fail to remember
But you, you fail to remember
Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time
Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time
Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time
