Songs Title£ºlike light to the flies
Behold our beloved revels
In tragedy (in tragedy)
Self-denying abhorence for bloodshed
Behold hypocrite
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Devoutly wished for blinded eyes
This tragedy's like light to the flies
This seems to suit you better
Bleeding out the eyes (bleeding out the eyes)
Hope's left in chain suspension
Holding onto lies, to make the truth
Behold our beloved revels
In tragedy (in tragedy)
Self-denying abhorence for bloodshed
Behold hypocrite
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
