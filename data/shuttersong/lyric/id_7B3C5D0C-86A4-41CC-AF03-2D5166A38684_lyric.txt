Time takes a cigarette
Puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger
then another finger
then your cigarette.
The wall-to-wall is calling
it lingers but still you forget
Oh oh oh oh oh
You're a rock n roll suicide.

Too old to lose it
but you're too young to choose it
and your clock waits so patiently on your song
Well, You walk past a cafe,
but you don't eat when you've lived to long
Oh oh oh oh oh
You're a rock n roll suicide

Chev brakes are snarling
as you stumble across the road
but the day breaks instead so you hurry home
don't let the sun blast your shadow
don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural
religeously unkind

Oh no love, you're not alone
you're watching yourself but you're too unfair
you got your head all tangled up
but if I can only make you care
Oh no love you're not alone
no matter what or who you've been
no matter when or where you've seen
all the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share
now I'll help you with the pain

you're not alone!
Just turn on with me
and you're not alone
Give me your hands
cos you're wonderful
Just gimme your hands
cos you're wonderful
gimme your hands
cos you're wonderful

oh, gimme your hands!
