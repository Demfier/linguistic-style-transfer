If you wanna stay, you should really stay Don't let me hold you back, don't let me hold you back
If you wanna go, you should really go
It's a simple fact it's nothing more than that.
I'm not being rude I'm just being real Breaking hearts is never something that you wanna feel

Now I'm on the road not looking back, back, yah, oh oh oh
You're sitting still, not moving much
It's taken over you

You're really feeling shocked
You had a chance to make it right
Do what you want, cuz I'll be gone tonight Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh
Cuz I'll be gone tonight
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh
Cuz I'll be gone tonight!
Swallow the bitter words, oh, how they used to burn

Watch as the tables turn, no longer my concern

Now that I'm out of site, baby you're out of mind
I'm not being rude, I'm just being real Broken hearts they never count unless it's you they kill,

Now yah feeling low and I'm not looking back, back, yah oh oh oh
You're sitting still, not moving much
It's taken over you
You're really feeling shocked

You had a chance to make it right
Do what you want, cuz I'll be gone tonight Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh
Cuz I'll be gone tonight
Woah
I'ma hold on tight to my own damn life, Woah, oh
If you call think twice, it's a broken line
You're sitting still, not moving much

It's taken over you
You're really feeling shocked

You had a chance to make it right
Do what you want

It's taken over you
You're really feeling shocked
You had a chance to make it right
Do what you want, cuz I'll be gone tonight Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh
Cuz I'll be gone tonight
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh
Cuz I'll be gone tonight!

Tonight tonight,
You're sitting still, not moving much, it's taken over you you're really fe
