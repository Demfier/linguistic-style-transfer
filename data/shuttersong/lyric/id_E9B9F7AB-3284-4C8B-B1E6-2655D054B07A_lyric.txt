Where Are U Now - Justin Bieber
Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
Need you the most
Where you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya 
Need you the most
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back
Quert was sayin'
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin'
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin'  oh lord
Where are you now that I need ya 
Where are you now that I need ya 
Need you the most
Where you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya 
Need you the most
I give you my hart when you such was broken
Yes I did
I Gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith and you doubt and it opened
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my choice to the open
Tell me he  where are you now that I need you 
Where are you now 
Where are you now that I need ya 
Couldn't find you anywhere
Where you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya 
I need you the most
