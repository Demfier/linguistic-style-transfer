Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh eeh ooh
ooh ooh ooh

We're so beautiful and so broken
I think the cover is about to crack open
I watched you through the window
at the Abbey
Looking like you're in a video

But when your so-called friends turn away
The shadow crosses over your face
For a minute I know just what you're thinking
You might have it all, but you're sure of one thing
Living in a plastic world
you think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing

I could be all that you need
to feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing, girl
Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh ooh
All the posers that hover around you

Dropping names and cash like the who's who
Bet they all think they're Hollywood and high class
Bet their numbers all wind up in the trash
And though you seem so hard to get too
I know all the secret places i can find you
I'd like that she likes the slummer on the dark side

Well I could keep you entertained for awhile
Living in a plastic world
you think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But I'm what you're missing

I'm what you're missing
I could be all that you need
to feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing
And girl when there's nobody else around

I'll make it okay to come down
Take off your Converse and your crown
Cause' you've been wandering
I've been waiting
And I'm what's missing

Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh eeh ooh
Living in a plastic world
you think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But i'm what you're missing, i'm what you're missing
I could be all that you need
to feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing, girl
I'm what you're missing, girl
I'm what you're missing, girl
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah
I'm what you're missing, girl
I'm what you're missing
I'm what you're missing
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah
