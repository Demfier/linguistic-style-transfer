All we have is love

oh, we're growing
faster than we ever could have dreamed
and our bellies are bulging
we're gonna burst right through our seams
it's got us all in competition
for wealth and recognition
globalization I say's a contradiction
for we can't keep paving over this world
we won't all fit in

all that we have is hope and love
so don't you worry child
don't you worry 'bout a thing
(in the night?)
but those can lift us up
so we can rise above
so we can rise above
and all that we have is hope and love
so don't you worry child
don't you worry 'bout a thing
(in the night?)
but those can lift us up
so we can rise
so we can rise above the madness

and there's enough wealth for everyone
but some have the most
and most have some
and there's enough food for us all to flourish
tell me why are so many malnourished
you say this weakness in an empty pocket, no
and I'll tell you this weakness in an empty heart
and you say there's strength in the power to control
and I'll tell you no, there's strength in only love and compassion

all that we have is hope and love
so don't you worry child
don't you worry 'bout a thing
(in the night?)
but those can lift us up
so we can rise above
so we can rise above
and all that we have is hope and love
so don't you worry child
don't you worry 'bout a thing
(in the night?)
but those can lift us up
so we can rise
so we can rise above the madness

soon we'll find our own way home
'cause we all need a little healing sometimes
soon we'll find our own way home
'cause we all need a little healing
so give love
it's the only thing that heals you
come on sisters, give it to your brothers
so give love
it's the only thing that heals you
cause we all need a little healing
so give love it's the only thing that heals you
come on brothers, give it to your sisters
so give love it's the only thing that heals you
'cause we all need a little healing

and I can rest to show you that love will always cure you
no matter what your sickness is
no matter what hurts you
so give love it's the only thing that cures you
we all need a little healing

and if you give it, I have learned
it'll all be returned
if you only give love
if you only just give your love

all that we have is hope and love
so don't you worry child
don't you worry 'bout a thing
(in the night?)
but those can lift us up
so we can rise above
so we can rise above
and all that we have is hope and love
so don't you worry child
don't you worry 'bout a thing
(in the night?)
but those can lift us up
so we can rise
so we can rise above the madness
