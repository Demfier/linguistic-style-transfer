What you wanna do baby

Where you wanna go

I take you to the room baby

I take you to the floor

I treat you like a real lady

No matter where you go

Just give me some time baby if you know

Even when we're right 
 
I know my heart is still beating you

Five more hours

Tell the night it's on tonight with you

This right here is my time for party

Five more hours we're just getting started

This right here is my time for party

Five more hours we're just getting started

Five more hours we're just getting started

How you wanna feel baby

What you wanna know

Just pour another drink baby, 
 
come on pour a little more

I'll treat you like a real lady, 
 
I'll keep you out the cold

I'll give you all my time baby, 

you know even when we're apart

I know my heart is still there with you

Five more hours

Tell the night it's on tonight with you

This is ye~

This right here is my time for party

Five more hours we're just getting started

This right here is my time for party

Five more hours we're just getting started

Five more hours we're just getting started

Just getting started

I follow the sign of your heartbeat

How he always calls me, 
 
finding my way back to you

I'm feeling it more now than ever

I'll do this forever, 
 
just to spend a night with you

This is ye~

This right here is my time for party

Five more hours we're just getting started

This right here is my time for party

Five more hours we're just getting started

Five more hours we're just getting started
