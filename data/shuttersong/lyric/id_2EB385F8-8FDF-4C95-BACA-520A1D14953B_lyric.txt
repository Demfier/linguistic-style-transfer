This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up
Light it up light it up
Haha it's the dirty south connection ya'll
Florida georgia line
Uh uh it's florida uh uh it's georgia
We light it up
Light it up light it up
The mixtape's got a little hank little drake
A little something bumping thump thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hanging 'round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon
Baby this is how we roll
I'm from the dirty dirty baby listen
My accent's got a little twang little thing
Little something something
Always makes the ladies scream my
My name louder reverse cowgirl
Little bump bump in that trunk
All up in my new maybach
Let her wear my snapback
You can find us where the party at
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you
Baby this is how we roll
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we love to get drunk
Yeah we cuss on them mondays
And pray on them sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day
'Cause this is how we roll
This is how we roll baby
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud cuttin' through the countryside
Baby this is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we do
We burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon
Baby this is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we roll
