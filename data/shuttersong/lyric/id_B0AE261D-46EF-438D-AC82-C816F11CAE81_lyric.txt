I come home in the morning light,

My mother says "When you gonna live your life right?"

Oh,mother,dear,

We're not the fortunate ones,

And girls,

They wanna have fu-un.

Oh,girls,

The phone rings in the middle of the night,

My father yells "What you gonna do with your life?"

Oh,daddy,dear,

You know you're still number one,


Some boys take a beautiful girl,

And hide her away from the rest of the world.

I wanna be the one to walk in the sun.
