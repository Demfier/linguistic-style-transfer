To your brother, to your sister, to your misses, to your mister.
To your friends, to your foes, give the love around and back around it goes.
It all comes from the top and it spreads right round
Treat a man wrong he's gonna pass it on down

To the next in line, who's probably his wife bringing up his kids
Now watchin' mamma cry
And they pick it up, cause they learn everything
Life has a funny way of going in a ring
End up growing up in trouble with the law
Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore
Now it seems that every brand new generation

Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation

They're trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation
That's lost its trust (that's lost its trust)
We gotta change before the train leaves the station
and realize the revolution ain't a revelation
it takes blood, sweat, tears, innovation
It starts with us, it starts with us.

Yeah, it starts by giving love to your brother
Giving love to your sister

Giving love to your misses
Love to your mister
Giving love to your friends
Love to your foes
Give the love around and back around it goes
giving love to your brother

giving love to your sister
givin love to your misses
love to your mister

giving love to your friends
love to your foes
give the love around, and back around it goes
Round it goes, round it goes

round it goes goes goes
Give the love around and back around it goes
Oh we're all just folks working in a wheel
Spinning all around life's cruel battlefield

Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day
Watch it wash away
I bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away

Flutter from a butterfly forms a storm
Over half a million people die
Oh we don't care because we're all desensitized
We don't realize we're putting all this shit before our children's eyes
Now every brand new generation

Have all been growing up with cracks in their foundation
We're trying fill a holes of a whole damn nation
That's lost it's trust (that lost it's trust)
We gotta change before the train leaves the station
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation
It takes blood, sweat, tears, innovation

It starts with us, it starts with us
it starts with giving love to your brother, love to your sister
givin love to your misses, love to your mister
Love to your friends (around it goes)
To your folks (around it goes)
Give the love around, back around it goes

give the love to your brother, give the love to your sister
give the love to your misses, love to your mister
give the love to your friends, love to your foes
give the love around and back around it goes
give the love around and back around it goes
give the love around and back around it goes
love to your friends, love to your foes
give the love around and back around it goes
