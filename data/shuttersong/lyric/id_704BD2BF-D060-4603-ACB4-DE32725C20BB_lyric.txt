This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long

Up up all night long
You, where the hell did you come from
You're a different, different kind of fun
And i'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come

Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me

Haven't felt it for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it

Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long

I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If i'd have known where i'd be now

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh I could do this for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long

Up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long

Up up all night long
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you

Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (one more time)
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long (Yeah)
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Up up all night long
