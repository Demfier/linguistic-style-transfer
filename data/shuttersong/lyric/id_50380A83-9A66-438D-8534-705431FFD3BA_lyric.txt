Crashd√Øet -Away From You

Sadie, the queen of disaster
I can't believe I fell for you
Lady, you tourbillon laughter
Makes me fade away

Lady, the wounds could heal but
Baby, when I'm living without you
Life's alright, I'm tired of your game
The more you lie the more I hope
You're gone forever, I feel alright
Cause we're through

Away from you, I will be fine
and I'll leave it all behind
Away from you, I never
look back
Everyone knows you're a maniac
Away from you, Theres no way turning back
