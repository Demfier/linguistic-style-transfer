What can I say?
I fucked this up again
What can I do?
I took it out on you
I run around and make
A mess of everything
I made a big mistake
And now I'm wondering

Would you
Bail me out if I need it?
Help me down
Will you catch me when I fall?
Another night I'm out here wasted
Another night you've got to take my call

Would you bail me out?
Bail me out
Bail me out
See are you gonna take my call?

So listen up
I know I'm out of line
Just settle down
You know it's gonna be alright

Please come around again
Get me out of here
Just take me far away
I really wanna disappear

Would you
Bail me out if I need it?
Help me out
Would you catch me when I fall?
Another night I'm out here wasted
Another night you've got to take my call

Would you bail me out?
Bail me out
Bail me out
Are you gonna take my call?

Dont stop
Ready or not
It's such a long way
Away from the top
And I know
That you'll be there to catch me
If I stumble down this road

Would you bail me out if I need it?
Help me down
Will you catch me when I fall?
Another night I'm out here wasted
Another night you've got to take my call

Would you bail me out if I need it?
Help me down
Will you catch me when I fall?
Another night I'm out here wasted
Another night you've got to take my call

Would you bail me out?
Bail me out
Bail me out
See are you gonna take my call?

Bail me out
Bail me out
