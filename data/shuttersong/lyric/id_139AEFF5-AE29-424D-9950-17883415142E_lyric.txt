Verse 1: 
 
I’ll be giving up, oh 
 
Home is where the heart is, 
And I gave it to you in a paper bag 
 
Even though it’s tarnished 
You told me it’s the best you ever had 
You got my secret combination 
And I don’t be giving that out easily 
 
With my deep … 
 
You can tell that you were brought the same for me 
 
Chorus: 
 
So please don’t let go, 
Cause you know exactly what we found 
So please don’t let go my darling 
 
You keep me hooked up underground 
 
It’s gonna be you and me 
It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed 
It’s gonna be who and me 
It’s gonna be everything and 
Everything, we’re meant to be 
 
We’re meant to be 
 
Verse 2: 
 
Rolling with the punches 
So they won’t get inside our happiness 
 
Love is always hunted, 
But you’re white rose is soaring through my tear 
Cause you know you give me something 
 
Yeah you give me exactly what I need 
 
Got my blood pumping 
 
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed 
 
Chorus: 
 
So please don’t let go, 
Cause you know exactly what we found 
So please don’t let go my darling 
 
You keep me hooked up underground 
It’s gonna be you and me 
 
It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed 
 
It’s gonna be who and me 
 
It’s gonna be everything and 
Everything, we’re meant to be 
 
In you’re big house on the hills 
 
Where you keeṗ your dollar bills 
 
And you stashed my heart 
 
Somewhere in the dark 
Keep it safe I know you will 
 
Know you will, know you will 
 
Know you will 
 
I know you will
