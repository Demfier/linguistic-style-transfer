I see your face, you see my face
A thousand races in space
Universal law never makes mistakes
Baby, you know I just wanna live with you
Do what I can to be my best
Nevertheless never settle for less
Higher I go, I'm never quenched
Even though life never goes so right
Do what you feel
All the ways that
All the ways that
All the ways that love can feel
All the ways that love can rise above

I know you can't hear me
I know you can't hear me
All the ways
All the ways
Class is in session tonight
Show me the lessons of your life
All the ways that love can feel alive

I see your face, you see my face
A thousand races in space

Baby, you know I just wanna live with you

Do what you feel
All the ways that
All the ways that

All the ways that love can feel
All the ways that love can rise above

Show me the lessons of your life
All the ways that love can feel alive
