We're taking the long way home
(Taking the long way home)

Take me back to the middle of nowhere
Back to the place only you and I share
Remember all the memories
The fireflies and make believe

Kicking back at the old school yard
Singing songs on our guitars
This is our reality
Crazy stupid you and me

We know this is the way it's supposed to be

So we're taking the long way home
(taking the long way home)
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with
you talking about nothing, yeah whatever baby
So we're taking the long way home
(taking the long way home)
Tonight

Taking the long way home
(Taking the long way home)
We're taking the long way home

Now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere
Yeah it only took our time to get there
Hiding out in our dreams
Catching fire like kerosene (kerosene)

And you know I'd never let you down
Till the sun comes up
We can own this town
Something like make believe
Living in a movie scene

Know this is the way it's supposed to be

So we're taking the long way home (taking the long way home)
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with
you talking about nothing, yeah whatever baby
So we're taking the long way home (taking the long way home)

Hitting every red light
Kissing at the stop signs darling
Green day's on the radio
And everything is alright
Now we're turning up the headlights darling
We're just taking it slow

So we're taking the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with you talking about nothing, yeah whatever baby
So we're taking the long way home

Hitting every red light
Kissing at the stop signs darling
Green day's on the radio
And everything is alright
Now we're turning up the headlights darling
We're just taking it slow

We're taking the long way home
We're taking the long way home
We're taking the long way home
