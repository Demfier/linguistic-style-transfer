You turn, and I learned that the wall comes falling down
Not a word, only heard what my friends can tell me now
I feel love when I see your face
But all these scars, I can't replace
Shock me high
Hit me hard, and I don't know what to say

When you knock on my door
And tell me you don't want to fight
Oh, baby I'm sure that I'm not gonna fall this time

You never brought me flowers
Never helped me in my darkest hours
And you left it so late that my heart feels nothing nothing and towers
Once we were made like towers
Everything could've been ours
But you left it too late now my heart feels nothing nothing at all

It's a shame
You're to blame
'Cause once you owned my heart
I remember feeling so high
But I'm right back at the start
I still feel love when I see your face
But all these tears I can't erase
Sorry heart, I'm sorry heart
But we'll have to start again
So don't knock on my door and tell me you don't wanna fight
'Cause I've heard it before
And I'm not going back this time
Not going back this time

You never brought me flowers
Never helped me in my darkest hours
And you left it so late that my heart feels nothing nothing and towers
Once we were made like towers
Everything could've been ours
But you left it too late now my heart feels nothing nothing at all

Nothing at all

When you're close I wanna change mind
But I remember you and what we're like
I don't wanna let you waste my time

And you never brought me flowers
Never helped me in my darkest hours
And you left it so late that my heart feels nothing nothing at all
Once we were made like towers
Everything could've been ours
But you left it too late now my heart feels nothing nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Once we were built like towers
Nothing at all
We were built like towers
Now my heart feels nothing at all
