 forever in blue...  in blue
Believe me girl, I tried not to call
But here I am once again, yes once again
Beside you, with my hands on the wall
Two hearts, reach for each other
Once chance, she's like no other
I'm lost, lost  in the dream of you
Those two hearts, reach for each other
Once chance, she's like no other
I'm lost, lost  in the dream of you
'Cause it's true oh
I'm  forever,  forever  in  blue
