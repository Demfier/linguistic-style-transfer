Glee Cast - Last Chritmas
Yeah      Ha      
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day  you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me 
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(whispered) Merry Christmas 
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
And meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day  you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day  you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
Oh my I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me 
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in her heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
(You tore me apart  ooo-ooo)
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day  you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day  you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
