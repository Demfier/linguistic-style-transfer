Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon your greatness
That you'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send
The call I'll send

Call all the ladies out
They're in there finally
A hundreds jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we told
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose they don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air, so there
So all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet but it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't recieve
Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kinda older than I was when rebelled without a care
So there

We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free
Living in ruins of the palace with in my dream
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know
