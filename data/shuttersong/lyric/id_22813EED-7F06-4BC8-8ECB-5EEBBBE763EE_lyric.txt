I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm goin' nowhere

I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
and I don't wanna let it go

Noooo
And I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit angry
When everyone's around
But I get a little lonely
When no one's out

I feel my demons misleading me

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer That things will get better

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
Weights off my shoulders
It was bringin' me down (down)

I've never been that lucky
I've never tasted fame (fame)
I was always lookin' for somethin'
But I hate changing

Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinnin and I won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there

Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground
I'm just a believer That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go
