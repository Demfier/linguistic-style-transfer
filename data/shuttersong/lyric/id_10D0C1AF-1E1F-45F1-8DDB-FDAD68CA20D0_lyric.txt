You end up alone after all that you've done
All that you've paid for

Did you get what you wanted?

Loaded the gun with all you were made of

When you're alone,

People don't think you know what you're made of, oh

You've been with me,

It's not up to see, it's all that you wait for

I'll find a way up

see you through what came to pay for

All our love, can we last?

Isn't it what it's made for?

You were there for me

And I was there for you

 
No-oh, never let you go!
You will always be the one

That I really love

 
No-oh, never let you go! 
Let you go!

Let you go!

You're here in the way,

How could you stay after that you've paid for

Leave it in time, won't let you wait

How could you be assured?

We're holding on our hope

Saying that we are trying to find home, home

I think I'm back again,

I've come to understand my will

Tell me that I can't pretend

I hear that you care about your stuff,

but the most of things might feel rough

And let you go

Holding a room for you

Holding a room, holding a room for you

You were there for me

And I was there for you

 
No-oh, never let you go! 

You will always be the one

That I really love

 
No-oh, never let you go! 
Holding a room for you

Holding a room, holding a room for you

You were there for me

And I was there for you

Oh oh, I remember times like that!

You will always be the one

That I really love

Oh oh, never let you go!

Let you go!

Let you go!
