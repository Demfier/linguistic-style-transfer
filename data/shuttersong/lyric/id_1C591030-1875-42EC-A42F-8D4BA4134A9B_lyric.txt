First things first, I'm the realest (realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let them feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness, I can hold you down
Like I'm givin' lessons in physics (right right)
You should want rape boys like this (huh?)
Drop it and serve it up just like this (yeah)
Full of grace, full of truth, full of heirs
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Let the fame and money raid, never chase that
(Never) Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back (what?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at? Champagne kill it, home cant raise that
I'm so fancy, you already know

I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow
I said baby I do this, I thought that you knew this
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department

Better get my money on time, if they ain't got money, decline

And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if it ain't 'bout money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
and gotta that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?

Remember my name, 'bout to blow
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y

That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y
Bout to blow (Blow)
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y
Bout to blow (blow)
