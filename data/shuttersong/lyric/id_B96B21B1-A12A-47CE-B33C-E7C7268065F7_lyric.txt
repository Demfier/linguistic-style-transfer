Anything she can do I can do it too
Wait till we get home, boy I'm gon' show you
Remember that thing she did on stage?
Times that by two, boy don't be afraid

I twerk it, twerk, it twerk it
Left right, twerk it
Throw it in yo face
Boy, you lookin' nervous
I make it hot when I'm surfin'
I make a split look perfect
You ain't swayin', you ain't workin'
I'll make it clap, you deserve it
Anything she can do, I can do betta
I betcha, nigga I betcha
Anything she can do, I can do betta
I betcha, nigga I betcha

I went to the club for some inspiration
I ain't plan on breakin' the bank
Cause I think one of these lame niggas put some Molly off in my drink
Now I'm feelin' myself, no hands
Nigga got me open, make me wanna pole dance
Yea, because she a stripper she ain't got no chance
Sexual connection makes it worth the romance
So baby, bring it on, we can get it, start it early
Got me swingin' from the ceilin' fan, while I'm swirlin'
Yeah you betta stretch out, fuck around, pull a muscle
This right here workin', lemme show you how to hustle
Lemme show you how to hustle

Anything she can do I can do it too
Wait till we get home, boy I'm gon' show you
Remember that thing she did on stage?
Times that by two, boy don't be afraid

I twerk it twerk it twerk it
Left right, twerk it
Throw it in yo face
Boy, you lookin' nervous
I make it hot when I'm severin'
I make the split look perfect
You ain't swayin', you ain't workin'
I'll make it clap, you deserve it
Anything she can do, I can do betta
I betcha, nigga I betcha
Anything she can do, I can do betta
I betcha, nigga I betcha

You know anything means anything
We could switch roles, you could make it rain
Make it wet, we gon' break a sweat
Said you study, time to take a test
Where da cash at? I ain't seen it yet
I'm just playin'
And you ain't even know what to do with it
I'm just sayin'
On my 'P's' and 'Q's' if its pleasing you, got my mind focused on us
The best part can be when I shake for free, and I never stop when the music change
And I apologize if I move too fast
But don't trip boy, you know I could make this ass...
Do anything...

Anything she can do, I can do betta
(Betta)
I betcha, nigga I betcha
I can do it
I can do it
I can do it
