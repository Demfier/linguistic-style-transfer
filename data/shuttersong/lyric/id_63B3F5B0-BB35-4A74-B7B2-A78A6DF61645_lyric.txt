I'm your piece of mind
Fight for what you've made yourself believe
Tell me what you find
Will you cross the line
To sabotage me?

I'm wide awake I'm wide awake

If you could save me now,
Would I want you to?
What will it take this time
To break away, forget your face
And everything you said?
I can't hold on to you anymore.

I'm your ignorance
Paid the price to dance
And fell to my knees
Love is dangerous
And when it comes to this nothings for free

You're wide awake waiting for me to sleep

If you could save me now,
Would I want you to?
What will it take this time,
To break away, forget your face
And everything you said?
I cant hold on to you anymore.
Anymore

How could you make me the promises?
I was confused!
Cause I never thought that you'd treat me like this!

I'm your piece of mind, fight for what you've made yourself believe

If you could save me now,
Would I want you to?
What will it take this time?
To break away, forget your face
And everything you said
I cant hold on to you anymore.
