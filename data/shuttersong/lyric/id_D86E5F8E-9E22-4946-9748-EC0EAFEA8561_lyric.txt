I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying "this is it I've had enough"
Because like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say "I hate you", we break up, you call me, I love you
Uuh...
We called it off again last night
But Uuh-uh-uh--uh-uh...
This time I'm telling you
I'm telling you,

We are never ever ever getting back together
We-eeee
Are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But We-eeee
Are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like... ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your piece of mind
With some Indie Record that's much cooler than mine
You called me up again tonight
But Uuh-uh-uh--uh-uh...
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We-eeee
Are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But We-eeee
Are never ever ever ever getting back together

Uuh-uh-uh--uh-uh... Uuh-uh-uh--uh-uh...
I used to think that we were forever ever ever
And I used to say "never say never"

We are never ever ever getting back together
We-eeee
Are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But We-eeee
Are never ever ever ever getting back together

And, we are never ever getting back together.
