She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go, oh-woah, let it go
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home, oh-woah, take her home

But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love, oh

Maybe she's just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth (what you're worth)
Maybe all her friends have told her, \
