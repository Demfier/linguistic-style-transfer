Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all, bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch, makes you fall in love like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
Ay, she's perfect
Ay, she's perfect

How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know if she can make a man lose his mind

With the smell of her perfume, I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh, curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
Ay, she's perfect

I could see her body rushing into you, crushing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep on your skin, skin next to me
She's crushing on your skin, settling in
Burning so deep, deep on your skin, skin while you're sleeping
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
Ay, she's perfect
