Hey you only need the light when it's burning low.
Only miss the sun when it's starts to snow.
Only know you love her when you let her go.
Only know you've been high when you feeling low.
Only hate the road when you missing home.
Only know you love her when you let her go, and you let her go!
Starring at the bottom of your clothes hope me you one day you make me dream lost but dreams come slow and you go so fast.
You see when you close your eyes maybe you one day you'll understand why everthing you touch surely dies.
But you only need the light when it's burning low.
Only miss the sun when it's starts to snow.
Only know you love her when you let her go.
Only know you've been high when you feeling low.
Only hate the road when you missing home.
Only know you love her when you let her go.
Starring at the seal in the dark, them old empty feeling in your heart!
'Cause love come slow and it go so fast.
Will you see when you fall asleep? And never to touch out, never to keep 'cause you loved it to much and you dive to deep.
Well you only need the light when it's burning low.
Only miss the sun when it's starts to snow.
Only know you love her when you let her go.
Only know you've been high when you feeling low.
Only hate the road when you missing home.
Only know you love her when you let her go, and you let her go.
And you let her go...
Will you let her go!
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low!
Only miss the sun when it's starts to snow!
Only know you love her when you let her go!
Only know you've been high when you feeling low!
Only hate the road when you missing home.
Only know you love her when you let her go.
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low.
Only miss the sun when it's starts to snow.
Only know you love her when you let her go.
Only know you've been high when you feeling low.
Only hate the road when you missing home.
Only know you love her when you let her go.
And you let her go...
