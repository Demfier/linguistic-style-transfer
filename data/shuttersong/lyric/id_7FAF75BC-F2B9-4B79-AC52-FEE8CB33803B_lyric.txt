I see clear just like a picture on the wall, and now I
Know how to steer, I'm not afraid if I should fall yeah
It took some tears but together we were strong
and now I feel a burning beat inside my heart and
I feel alive for the first time in my life, oh baby
I feel alive tonight
You lift me up, before I fall too far
You lift me up you help me see the stars
You pick me up when all my hope is gone
You lift me up, you lift me up
You lift me
Living in fear, I couldn't see the rising sun
Just felt the weight of the world every time I tried to run
You helped remind me who I am and where I'm from
And now I feel a burning beat in my heart, yeah
I feel alive for the first time in my life, oh baby
I feel alive tonight
You lift me up before I fall too far
You lift me up, you help me see the stars
You pick me up when all my hope is gone
You lift me up, you lift me up, you lift me
You lift me, you lift me
Been through the fire but we blocked off the pain
And we kept reaching higher, you were with me all the way
No turning back now, we're so alive tonight tonight tonight
You lift me up before I fall too far
You lift me up, you help me see the stars
You pick me up when all my hope is gone
You lift me up, you lift me up
You lift me
You lift me up, you lift me up
You lift me up (you lift me)
