Come as you are
As you were
As I want you to be
As a friend
As a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time
Hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest
As a friend
As an old-
Memoria
Memoria

Memoria
Memoria

Come doused in mud
Soaked in bleach
As I want you to be

As a trend

As a friend
As an old-
Memoria

Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
(...)

(No, I don't have a gun)
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
