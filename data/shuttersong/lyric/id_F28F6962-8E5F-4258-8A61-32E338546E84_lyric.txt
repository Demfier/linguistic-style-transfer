All I want for Christmas is anything but you
I wrote it on my wishlist
Santa better make it true
All I do for Christmas is anyone but you
You put me on your hit list
And you screwed me like a tool

I woke up feeling good but on my own
For the first time in weeks I'm letting go
Now you tell me how is that for Christmas?
Been a while and I don't miss you at all
The only thing I missed are your phone calls
Now tell me how is that for Christmas?

You thought I'd always be around but all you did was beat me down
Now you're back for another round

All I want for Christmas is anything but you
I wrote it on my wishlist
Santa better make it true
All I do for Christmas is anyone but you
You put me on your hit list
And you screwed me like a tool

Did you think I would wake up and come back
At the snap of you're fingers like that
And tell me how is that for Christmas?
Said that you want me back now that I'm gone
Keep on trying so hard but I've moved on
And tell me how is that for Christmas?

You thought I'd always be around but all you did was beat me down
Now you're back for another round

All I want for Christmas is anything but you
I wrote it on my wishlist
Santa better make it true
All I do for Christmas is anyone but you
You put me on your hit list
And you screwed me like a tool

Just forgive me I'm gone you never meet me
I tried to give you my all you didn't get me
I said just let me be free you wouldn't let me
And now you're stuck to my sleeve like some confetti
So you stay out of my life I'll do the same
Please forgive me I don't remember your name
Anything but you that's all I wanna discuss
Anything but you that's all I want for Christmas

All I want for Christmas is anything but you
I wrote it on my wishlist
Santa better make it true
All I want for Christmas is anything but you
I wrote it on my wishlist
Santa better make it true
All I do for Christmas is anyone but you
You put me on your hit list
And you screwed me like a tool
