(Aaah!)
(Aayh!)

When you're away at work
I'm seeing this other guy
He's treating me really well
You know I don't ask for much

It's so hard to be alone
You're always gone
It's so hard to be alone
You're always gone

Ah-ah-ah-ah-I
Wanna feel the music take me away
Ah-ah-ah-ah-I
Feel the beat and the music take me away (Heey!)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-I (Yeaaah, yay!)
Wanna feel the music take me away (Yaay-iih-yaay-iih-yaay!)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-I
Feel the beat and the music (Aaah!) take me away (Heey!)

Sorry to break your heart
(But you don't really give me much choice, do ya)
I have to live my life
(And all I wanna do is to dance and have fun)

It's so hard when you're away
I'm all alone
It's so hard when you're away
I'm all alone

Ah-ah-ah-ah-I
Wanna feel the music take me away (Yaay-iih-yaay-iih-yaay!)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-I
Feel the beat and the music (Aaah!) take me away
I...
Ah-ah-ah-ah-I (Wanna dance, wanna da...!)
Wanna feel the music take me away (Yaay-iih-yaay-iih-yaay!)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-I (Aaah!)
Feel the beat and the music take me away
