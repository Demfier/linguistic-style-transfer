I know a girl who wants to be my friend
She's a 10, but I don't want to be her friend
'Cause I want something more in the end, in the end

(I want to tell her)

You're my American Pie and I really really want a piece
'Cause you keep my adrenaline high and I never get no release

And now I'm singing,
You're in somebody else's bed
You say you want me there instead
You keep on messing with my head
When we get close to the end zone,
You put me back in the friend zone (hey, yeah)
You put me back in the friend zone (hey, yeah)
You put me back in the friend zone

You got me sprung like a spring girl,
You got me photo for the ring girl,
Give me a shot and I'm in girl,
But you ain't giving me a thing girl

(I want to tell her)

You're my American Pie and I really really want a piece
'Cause you keep my adrenaline high and I never get no release

And now I'm singing,
You're in somebody else's bed
You say you want me there instead
You keep on messing with my head
When we get close to the end zone,
You put me back in the friend zone (hey, yeah)
You put me back in the friend zone (hey, yeah)
You put me back in the friend zone

You're in somebody else's bed
I'll climb through the window and break his head
'Cause you're all I ever wanted

What kind of boyfriend's name is Chad?
Seriously?
Fuck that dude, whatever his fucking name is

You're in somebody else's bed
You said you want me there instead
You keep on messing with my head
When we get close to the end zone,
You put me back in the friend zone

You're in somebody else's bed
You say you want me there instead
You keep on messing with my head
When we get close to the end zone,
You put me back in the friend zone (hey, yeah)
You put me back in the friend zone (hey, yeah)
You put me back in the friend zone
