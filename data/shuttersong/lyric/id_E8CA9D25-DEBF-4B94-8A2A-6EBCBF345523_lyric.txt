Send My Love (To Your New Lover) - Adele
Written by£ºAdele Adkins/Max Martin/Karl Johan Schuster
This was all you
None of it me
You put your hands on
On my body and told me
Told me you were ready
For the big one
For the big jump
I'd be your last love
Everlasting you and me
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
I was too strong
You were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising
Baby I'm still rising
I was running you were walking
You couldn't keep up you were falling down
There's only one way down
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready if you're ready if you're ready I am ready
If you're ready if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
Know we ain't kids no more
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready if you're ready if you're ready I am ready
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready if you're ready if you're ready I am ready
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
