Okay okay
Why? Why?
Okay okay
Everybody's looking for that something
No one ever wants to pay the price
Everybody's scared of going nowhere
But we ain't going anywhere tonight!

I should be more cynical than tell myself it's not okay
To feel this good when I'm with you
Tried my best to fight it, say I hate you
But I always stay!
Oh ooh ooh oh oh

Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!

Okay, hold up
Everybody's talking 'bout the next thing
Feel like what they got ain't good enough, ooh
But all I wanna do release the tension
Bring the conversation back to us.
Oh yeah!

I should be more cynical than tell myself it's not okay
To feel this good when I'm with you
Tried my best to fight it, say I hate you
But I always stay!
Oh ooh ooh oh oh

Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!

Uh, can we stop all the yelling baby
and hear me out
I want you here and now!
Tried my best to fight it, say I hate you
But I always stay!
Heyy! Heyy!
Yeaaah, yeah alright
Everybody's looking for that new thing
Ooh oh oh
Ooh oh oh
Ain't nobody nobody nobody like
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
