If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world
To find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark, and you can't see
I'll be the light
To guide you

Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like 4, 3, 2
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah

Woooh woo
Yeah yeah

If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song
Beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Every day I will
Remind you

Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like 4, 3, 2
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah

Woooh woo
Yeah yeah

You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go, never say goodbye
You know you can

Count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like 4, 3, 2
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do

Count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like 4, 3, 2
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah
Woooh woo
You can count on me 'cause
