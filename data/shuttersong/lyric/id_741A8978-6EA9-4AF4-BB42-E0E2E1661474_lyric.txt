I try not to believe
Everything I hear, everything I see
But it's hard with everything I bet
In favor of, It all be real, yeah
It's hard to be in doubt with all the pieces there are to believe
And it's hard not to go with everything that I'm feelin' in me

Into the night, I'm going there to
Walk too close to the tides
To be swept up in her arms,
Awake and alive, I come out here to
Be with you one more time

Are we one, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?
When we go walk, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?
Are we love?

In the sky, open trees
In the ocean blue, everything is free
I'm alive, with all the feeling I have in me
'Cuz they are so real, yeah
It's hard to be in doubt with all the reasons there are to believe
Right now I'm gonna go with everything that I'm feelin' in me

Into the night, I'm going there to
Walk too close to the tides
To be swept up in her arms,
Home and alive, I come out here to
Be with you one more time

Are we one, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?
When we go walk, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?

And now I can tell you 'bout it
I'll carry on like it do'nt exist
But in my heart I'm really thinkin' 'bout it
And I gotta let you know what it is

And now I can tell you 'bout it
I'll carry on like it do'nt exist
But in my heart I'm really thinkin' 'bout it
And I gotta let you know what it is

Are we one, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?
When we go walk, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?
