Hey heart, on the road again
Moving on forward
Stick and stones won't break our bones
We're in the car on the highway
It's a magical feeling that no one's got a hold
You're a catalyst to your own happiness you know

This is your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling
And it's whistling

Hey heart, on the run again
Drive is strong onward
Stick and stones won't take its course
You got the part in the front seat
It's the best world's feeling
Like nothing can go wrong
You're the decider of the world that you will get to know

Cause it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling.

Hey heart, on the road again
On a highway, on a highway
Hey, heart, on the road again
On a highway, on a highway.

Cause it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling
And it's whistling
And it's whistling
And it's whistling
