If you're looking for me follow the screaming
Looking for a good time just jump in
We got the blacked out shades, black top, black bottoms,
Black diamonds, we got them

City is our personal play ground,
Pretty girls always around
Every night is a new adventure
And everyday it gets better

When we ball we ball hard
When we fly you'll see stars
Everywhere I go is always off the chain
And everybody knows my name

All day and night
I I
Can't deny
I I
Love my life
I I
Love my mymy...
All day and night
I I
Just can't lie
I I
Love my life
I I
Love my mymy... life

Made a couple bucks, I'm bout to make more
But half my stuff I ain't even had to pay for
I'm a king what ever you call it
Can buy a castle with the money in my wallet

Hit the club whole place stops
Hands up like somebody called the cops
I'm armed but ain't holding
It's just I'm golden

When we ball we ball hard
When we fly you'll see stars
Everywhere I go is always off the chain
And everybody knows my name

All day and night
I I
Can't deny
I I
Love my life
I I
Love
All day and night
I I
just can't lie
I I
love my life
I I
love my my my my my my life

Hands up high, hands up high if you love love love love love,
Hands up high, hands up high, if you love love love love love,
If you love your life
Get your hands up high, get your hands up high.
If you love your life.

And when we ball we ball hard.
And even when we fall, you'll see stars.
Everywhere I go is always off the chain
and everybody knows my name

All day and night
I I
Can't deny
I I
Love my life
I I
Love my mymy... life
All day and night
I I
Just can't lie
I I
Love my life
I I
Love my mymy
All day and night
I I
Just can't lie
I I
Love my life
I I
Love my mymy... life
