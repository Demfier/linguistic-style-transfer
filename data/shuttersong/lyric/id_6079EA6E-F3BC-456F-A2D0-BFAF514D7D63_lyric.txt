We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love

Turn it up now!
Get it poppin', hop the molly
Dirty bass, we're so body body
Too egit, we can't quit the party

Super freaks, no Illuminati
So, one, two, hit the booze
We on YouTube, nothing to lose
So let it loose, 'cause the sheep don't sleep

Like pop pop pop pop pop

Drop low to the L O
V E gotta get low
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands

I got nothing but love to give
Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me no
Here's some love for your stereo

So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give

We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air

So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love
We are one tonight

And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love

Go ahead now floss your love like a heart of gold
Dirty bass will make your pussy fall
If you go low, on the floor
I got a crew that will handle that, cookie jar

Damn girl, I ain't tryin' to be rude
Spread love like a guest list you plus two
That's what you call a move
Like pop pop pop pop pop

Drop low to the L O
V E gotta get low
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give

Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me no
Here's some love for your stereo
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
Like pop pop pop pop pop

Turn me on like this your song
Dirty bass got love to give
Turn it up now

Mad monopoly all night long
Dirty bass got love to give
Yo, let me see that grill from here to here
So much love in the atmosphere
The good times roll with me right here
I got nothing but love to give
We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love
We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the love
Turn it up now
Turn it up now
Dirty bass got
Love to give
(Got love to give)
Like pop pop pop pop
