I try to tell you time and time again
You are trapped inside a feeling
and the scam never ends
Its making you a stranger to your soul
Pay to lose the merry
soon youll be forgettin
You keep hoping it will go

You cant get enough
You cant get enough
Pleasure

Maybe all the troubles in your mind
You can take a couple pills
Try to hide your worries if you like
Youre missing every chance you had to live
Soon youll be regrettin
The people that you are lettin
and the person that youve been

You cant get enough
You cant get enough
Cant get enough
Cant get enough.
