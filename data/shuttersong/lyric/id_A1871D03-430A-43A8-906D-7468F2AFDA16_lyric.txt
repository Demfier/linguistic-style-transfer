I've been to all the familiar places
I've been running like a sentence never begun
I've been looking for way to let you know well
I've got nothing left to fill the spaces
I've got nothing but a centre coming undone
I've been doing circles and it shows it shows
Every cloud in the sky

Every place that I hide
Tell me that I
I was wrong to let you go
Every sound that I hear
Every thought that I fear
Tell me that I
I was wrong
I was wrong to let you go

It's the little things that make you crazy

Like the thought of someone touching your skin
I can see you everywhere I go i go
You could be inside a sea of faces
It could be the rumour of your grin
Swimming in the river as it flows it flows
Every cloud in the sky

Every place that i hide
Tell me that i
I was wrong to let u go
Every sound that i hear
Every thought that i fear
Tell me that i
I was wrong i was wrong to let you
To let u go to let u go to let u go

Every cloud in the sky
Every place that i hide
Tell me that i
I was wrong to let u go
Every sound that i hear
Every thought that i fear
Tell me that i
i was wrong i was wrong to let u go
