Baby I've been searching
Searching through these crowds
To make my find someone who knows what I'm about
All these excuses, you're too sound down
So it's crazy what you got me doing now
Hold up baby
You know you drive crazy
And I want everybody to know

I'm down
Nobody's looking right now
Ain't not time for messing around
But it won't take a minute
Baby come kiss me quick
The satire feeling right here
Make this unforgettable
Baby come kiss me quick

No we don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring
So don't put the pause when giving it plain
You got me hooked on your VDA
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Before you go away

Hold up baby
You know you drive crazy
And I want everybody to know

I'm down
Nobody's looking right now
Ain't not time for messing around
But it won't take a minute
Baby come kiss me quick
The satire feeling right here
Make this unforgettable, yeah
Baby come kiss me quick
