You were in the flow, of things
don't you know?
I was there with you somehow, somehow

Windows in the sun, i think i can see you,
The light is on the run and it's going nowhere.

Hello to you
did you ever know that you were in the middle of my mind?
Hello to you
i could never figure out why you were so hard to find.

You were in the sand, dancing forever
I was there with you, somehow somehow

Hello to you
did you ever know that you were in the middle of my mind?
Hello to you
i could never figure out why you were so hard to find.

You were on the street, striding to somewhere.
Life is at your feet, and i think i'm there.
