California
Then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well that's what took me where I need to be
Which is here
Out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California
At the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does

Whoa, All I know
And all I need to know is there is no,
Yeah, there is no end to love

I didn't call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone's a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom
In a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California
Blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself
There's no end to grief
That's how I know

Whoa, That's how I know
And why I need to know that there is no,
Yeah, there is no end to love
Whoa, All I know
And all I need to know is there is no,
Yeah, there is no end to love

There is no end to love...

Whoa, All I know
And all I need to know is there is no,
Yeah, there is no end to love
Whoa, we come and go
Stolen days you don't give back
Stolen days are just enough
