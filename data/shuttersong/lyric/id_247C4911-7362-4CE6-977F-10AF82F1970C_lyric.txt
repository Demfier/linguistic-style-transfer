It's like i'm waiting for something specific
But i'm not sure yet what it is
I want to test out love at first sight, out love at first breath
Oh but am i ready yet

I'm holding out for you
But i don't even know who you are
Wishing on some star
I can get it right next time
Balancing on the edge
Of a little more not less
Heres myself and
I am here in my dress
Slow slow slow

Touch me when the lights go off
It feels better that way
Touch me 'til the music stops
It feels simple that way
Hold me like i need you to
'til i walk away
Kiss me like i need you to
I'm making it simple if you care
Oh but don't fall in love

And it's like i'm craving for something that i've never had
Oh but i cant tell you that
It's the best damn thing to own
And i wanna go back to what i know for sure
To where i feel secure
But have i forgotten everything that i know

When i'm holding out for you
I don't even know who you are
Wishing on some star
I can get it right next time
Balancing on the edge
Of a little more not less
Oh here is myself and
I am here in my dress
Slow slow slow

Touch me when the lights go off
It feels better that way
Touch me 'til the music stops
It feels simple that way
Hold me like i need you to
'til i walk away
Kiss me like i need you to
I'm making it simple if you care
Oh but don't fall in love

Touch me when the lights go off
It feels better that way
Touch me 'til the music stops
It feels simple that way
Hold me like i need you to
'til i walk away
Kiss me like i need you to
I'm making it simple if you care
Oh but don't fall in love

Touch me when the lights go off
It feels better that way
Touch me 'til the music stops
It feels simple that way
Hold me like i want you to
'til i walk away
Kiss me like i need you to
Yeahh yeahh

Oh but don't fall in love
No don't fall in love with me
