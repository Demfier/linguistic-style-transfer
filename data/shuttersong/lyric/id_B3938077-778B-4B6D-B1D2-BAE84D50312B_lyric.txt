Please tell me why do birds
sing when you're near me
sing when you're close to me

They say that I'm a fool
for loving you deeply
loving you secretly

But I crash in my mind
whenever you are near
getting deaf, dumb and blind
just drowning in despair
I am lost in your flame
it's burning like the sun
and I call out your name
whenever you are gone

Please tell me why can't I
breathe when you're near me
breathe when you're close to me

I know, you know I'm lost
in loving you deeply
loving you secretly
secretly

But I crash in my mind
whenever you are near
getting deaf, dumb and blind
just drowning in despair
I am lost in your flame
it's burning like the sun
and I call out your name
whenever you are gone

Tomorrow
(say it all tomorrow) I'll tell it all tomorrow
(say it all tomorrow) or the day after tomorrow
(say it all today) I'm sure I'll tell you then

Well, I crash in my mind
whenever you are near
getting deaf, dumb and blind
just drowning in despair
Well, I am lost in your flame
it's burning like the sun
and I call out your name
The moment you are gone
