Come they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

[Scott:]
A new born King to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

[Mitch:]
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

[Kirstie:]
To lay before the king
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum

So to honor Him
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
When we come

[Scott:]
Little baby
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
I am a poor boy too
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

[Mitch & Kirstie:]
I have no gift to bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
That's fit to give our King
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum

Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

I played my drum for Him
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
I played my best for Him
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum

[Kirstie, Scott & Mitch:]
Then He smiled at me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Me and my drum
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Kristie:]
Come they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
A new born King to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

Me and my drum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum
