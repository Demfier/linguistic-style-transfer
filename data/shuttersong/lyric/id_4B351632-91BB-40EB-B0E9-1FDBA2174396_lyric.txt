It's more than I can take
Just slowly coming down
Spinning figure-eights
But I'm in it
And I'm barely half-awake
Just waiting on the ground
For the hourglass to break
Any minute

We're living an American life
Keeping busy wasting time
Running on a chemical high
And it never felt so good

We're infinite high
We're infinite falling
Infinite high
And it never felt so good

We're infinite high
We're infinite falling
Infinite high
And we never had it so good
And it's getting all too much
Your life is getting hard
Living month-to-month
On a credit card

And it's never quite enough
Just being who we are
And searching for a rush

Until we've gone too far
We're living an American life
Keeping busy wasting time
We're running on a chemical high
And it never felt so good
We're infinite high
We're infinite falling
Infinite high

And it never felt so good
We're infinite high
We're infinite falling
Infinite high

And we never had it so good
Infinite, infinite high
Infinite, infinite high
Infinite, infinite high

We're infinite high
We're infinite falling
Infinite high
And it never felt so good
We're infinite high
We're infinite falling
Infinite high
And we never had it so good
