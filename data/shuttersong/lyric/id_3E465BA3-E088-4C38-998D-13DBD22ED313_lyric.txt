Take my hand, I'll teach you to dance.
I'll spin you around, won't let you fall down.
Would you let me lead? You can step on my feet.
Give it a try, it'll be alright

The room's hush hush and now's our moment.
Take it in, feel it all and hold it
Eyes on you, eyes on me.
We're doing this right.

'Cause lovers dance when they're feeling in love
Spotlight's shining. It's all about us
It's oh, oh, all
About uh, uh, us
And every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling, You never felt Boy
But it's all about us

Suddenly I'm feeling brave
Don't know what's got into me
Why I feel this way
Can we dance real slow?
Can I hold you real close?

The room's hush hush and now's our moment
Take it in, feel it all and hold it
Eyes on you, eyes on me
We're doing this right

Cause lovers dance when they're feeling in love
Spotlight's shining. It's all about us
It's oh, oh, all
About uh, uh, us
And every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling You never felt Boy
But it's all about us

Do you hear that love? They're playing our song
Do you think we're ready? Oh, I'm really feeling it
Do you hear that love? Do you hear that love?

Do you hear that love? They're playing our song
Do you think we're ready yet? Oh, I'm really feeling it
Do you hear that love? Do you hear that love?
