When you think no one is watching
I'm watching only you
When you feel no one listening
I hear through the noise to hear you
If you're looking for the demons
To play while with your own
Then you should look no further
Here with me you'll never have to be alone

Your shoulder blades
Your eyes ablaze
The way you throw your head back
When you're losing faith
But finding hope
It lights your face
That helps me cope
Through all of this without a kiss
And I get through all of this without a kiss

From the atlas
Take me far
Leave me reckless
Off the map
Turn the paper
Don't bring me back
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
Do you feel how I'm feeling
My cup is half empty
You can crush all the parts
And break them in half for me
Stop the words on my tongue
From cutting my mouth to pieces
Cover your eyes
Because I don't know what this is

Your shoulder blades
Your eyes ablaze
The way you throw your head back
When you're losing faith
But finding hope
It lights your face
That helps me cope
Through all of this without a kiss
And I get through all of this without a kiss

From the atlas
Take me far
Leave me reckless
Off the map
Turn the paper
Don't bring me back
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
My eyes see you
I see you but you don't see me
(You don't see me)
(You don't see me)
