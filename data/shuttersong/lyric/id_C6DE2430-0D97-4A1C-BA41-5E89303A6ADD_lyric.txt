 Baby Got Back&quot; 
 Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt. 
 It is so big. *scoff* She looks like, 
 one of those rap guys' girlfriends. 
 But, y'know, who understands those rap guys? *scoff* 
 They only talk to her, because, 
 she looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? 
 I mean, her butt, is just so big. *scoff* 
 I can't believe it's just so round, it's like, 
 out there, I mean - gross. Look! 
 She's just so ... black! 
 I like big butts and I can not lie 
 You other brothers can't deny 
 That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist 
 And a round thing in your face 
 You get sprung, wanna pull out your tongue 
 'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed 
 Deep in the jeans she's wearing 
 I'm hooked and I can't stop staring 
 Oh  baby, I wanna get wit'cha 
 And take your picture 
 My homeboys tried to warn me 
 But with that butt you  got makes me feel so horny 
 Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin 
 You say you wanna get in my Benz? 
 Well, use me, use me 
 'Cause you ain't that average groupy 
 I've seen them dancin' 
 The hell with romancin' 
 She's sweat, wet, 
  Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette 
 I'm tired of magazines 
 Sayin' flat butts are the thing 
 Take the average black man and ask him that 
 She gotta pack much  back 
 So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!) 
 Has your girlfriend  got the butt? (Hell yeah!) 
 Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!) 
 Shake that healthy butt! 
  Baby  got  back! 
 (LA face with Oakland booty) 
  Baby  got  back! 
 I like 'em round, and big 
 And when I'm throwin' a gig 
 I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal 
 Now here's my scandal 
 I wanna get you home 
 And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh 
 I ain't talkin' bout Playboy 
 'Cause silicone parts are made for toys 
 I want 'em real thick and juicy 
 So find that juicy double 
 Mix-a-Lot's in trouble 
 Beggin' for a piece of that bubble 
 So I'm lookin' at rock videos 
 Watchin' these bimbos walkin' like hoes 
 You can have them bimbos 
 I'll keep my women like Flo Jo 
 A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya 
 I won't cuss or hit ya 
 But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *f*k* 
 Til the break of dawn 
  Baby  got it goin' on 
 A lot of simps won't like this song 
 'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it 
 And I'd rather stay and play 
 'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong 
 And I'm down to get the friction on 
 So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah} 
 If you wanna role in my Mercedes {Yeah!} 
 Then turn around! Stick it out! 
 Even white boys  got to shout 
  Baby  got  back! 
  Baby  got  back! 
 Yeah,  baby ... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't  got nothin' 
 to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3&quot;.
