Captured effortlessly
that's the way it was
happened so naturally
Idid not know it was love.
The next thing I felt was you holding me close
what was I gonna do
I let myself go.
And now we fly through the stars
I hope this night will last forever.

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I've been waiting for you
it's been so long

I knew just what I would do when I heard your song.
You filled my heart with a kiss
you gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone.
And now we're flying through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I make my wish upon a star and hope this night will last forever
I make my wish upon a star and hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me.
We stare into each other's eyes
and what we see is no surprise
We've got a feeling most would treasure
and love so deep we cannot measure.

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
