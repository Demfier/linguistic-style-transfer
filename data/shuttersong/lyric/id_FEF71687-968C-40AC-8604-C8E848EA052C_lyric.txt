Picking up the pieces
All the little pieces
They lie on the floor
They were once our hearts
Once our hearts were beating
And we felt them beating
It all fell apart
As you stand before me
I'm give in to the memories
And time has gone by
A fairy tale ought not to die
I just wanna make up
Back to where we gave up
Shed light in my dark

Cause I don't ever wanna let go of you
That's all I know
If you feel the same about me
Come and let it show

I can't believe that I would
never thought that I could find someone like you
Delicate, who's heart is true
And I recall the feeling
Of love a deeper meaning
Now that we've been through
As you stand before me
I'm give in to the memories
And time has gone by
In a wink of a night
Oh don't you wanna make up
Forget about the shake up
And make fire with a spark

Cause I don't ever wanna let go of you
That's all I know
If you feel the same about me
Come and let it show

And I don't ever wanna let go of you
We've been high and low
Love is tough when you feel the real deal
Baby let's take it slow
Every word that I'm saying
Comes from deep within my soul
As we pick up the pieces
All the pieces of our hearts we're making whole

Picking up the pieces
All the little pieces
They lie on the floor
