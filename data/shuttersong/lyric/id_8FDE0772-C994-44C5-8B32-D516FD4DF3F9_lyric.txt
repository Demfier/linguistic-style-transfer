I don't really care when you say that girls just want to have fun
Want to do her hair every single day 'til the end of the month
Hey look at this one, fine as hell but missed some
Significant screws and pistons that's why I can never pick one

I know you called me 'cause you have no place to go
If you want me 'cause you're lonely I'll pretend you ain't a hoe
'Cause you fine, you know you're fine, that's why your mind is like a bowl
Of compliments and confidence, hey that's how it goes oh

Oh oh, you are just an LA girl, I will never fall for
Oh oh, a spoiled little LA girl, I don't really need that
Oh oh, you are just an LA girl acting like you own the world
Stupid little LA girl and I don't really need that

Big butt and a face like Cali, takes more than a pretty face to wow me
She can't go anywhere without me, she's an LA girl but she never been to Cali

I got a girl who fine as shit and I want all y'all to know but the problem with this chick is that she coming at me cold
When we making our deposits into her apartment you know that I'm an artist so why you think I got shit
You acting like you want me, you just want some clothes, yeah I know I got a side piece you are just a pro, man
I call you 'cause you stay up, tap you so you wake up, fine as a day job, you are getting laid off

Oh oh, you are just an LA girl, I will never fall for
Oh oh, a spoiled little LA girl, I don't really need that
Oh oh, you are just an LA girl acting like you own the world
Stupid little LA girl, I don't really need that

Big butt and a face like Cali, takes more than a pretty face to wow me
She can't go anywhere without me, she's an LA girl and she never been to Cali

If lodging (if lodging) is a problem (is a problem) there's a hotel (there's a hotel) that can solve it

Oh oh, you are just an LA girl I will never fall for
Oh oh, a spoiled little LA girl, I don't really need that
Oh oh, you are just an LA girl acting like you own the world
Stupid little LA girl, I don't really need that

Big butt and a face like Cali, takes more than a pretty face to wow me
She can't go anywhere without me, she's an LA girl and she never been to cali
Big butt and a face like Cali, takes more than a pretty face to wow me
