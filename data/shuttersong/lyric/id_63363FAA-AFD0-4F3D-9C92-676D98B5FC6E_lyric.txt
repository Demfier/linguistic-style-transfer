Marked for demolition; I'm
just a penis ticking inside.
No hope for the hopeless.
I can see the pieces all laid out in front of me.

No point even asking why.
Couldn't help even if you tried.
Step aside or you might just be the next contestant to feel the brutality.

Devastation, obliteration
Are all to the point of exacerbation
There's no explaining my situation; Now
why does this shit keep happenin' to me?

I've held on too long just to let it go now.
Will my inner strength get me through it somehow?
Defying the curse that has taken hold.
Never surrender, I'll never be overcome.

Too dark for forgiveness; I
can't seem to do anything right.
When I tried to rebuild I see my humble shelter just fall to the ground again.

Object of an evil eye.
No point to let anyone try.
Take heed, my friend lest you be torn asunder like all that's become of me.

Decimation, disintegration; Now
beyond the point of imagination.
