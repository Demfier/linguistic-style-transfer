Where the fun, ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, ain't got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, ain't got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To climb to
High all the time
To climb to

High all the time

To keep you off my mind

High all the time
To climb to

High all the time
To keep you off my mind
