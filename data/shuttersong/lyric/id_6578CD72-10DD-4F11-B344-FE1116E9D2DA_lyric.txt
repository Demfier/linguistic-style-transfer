WASHINGTON: Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been
anywhere in the world tonight, but you're
here with us in New York City. Are you ready
for a cabinet meeting huh?
The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton's
plan to assume state debt and establish a
national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have
the floor, sir.

JEFFERSON: ‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn't settle for less.
These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em.
Don't act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em.
Oww
But Hamilton forgets
his plan would have the government assume
state's debts. Now, place your bets as to who that benefits: the very seat of government where
Hamilton sits.

HAMILTON: Not true!

JEFFERSON: Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it.
If New York's in debt why should Virginia bear it?
Uh! Our debts are paid, I'm afraid.
Don't tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade.
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground.
We create. You just wanna move our money around.
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
and it's too many damn pages for any man to
understand.
Stand with me in the land of the free
and pray to God we never see Hamilton's candidacy.
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky.
Imagine what gon' happen when you try to tax our whisky.

WASHINGTON: Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response.

HAMILTON: Thomas. That was a real nice declaration.
Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation.
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic.
How do you not get it? If we're aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you don't pay for labor.
