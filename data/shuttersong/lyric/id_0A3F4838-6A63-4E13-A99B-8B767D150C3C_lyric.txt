No choice now, it's too late

Let him go, he gave up

I gave up

Lisa said Take time for me

Dropping him down to his knees

Oh chest down

Take me away, see I've got to explain
Things they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place
Ah you drink too much, makes me drink just the same

People try, felt so right
Giving themselves good advice
Looking down sometimes felt nice

He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then in dollars makes more dead than alive
Lets suck more blood lets work 3 hours a day
The world is over and I don't care cause
I am with you, now I've got to explain
Things they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place
You drink too much, makes me drink just the same
