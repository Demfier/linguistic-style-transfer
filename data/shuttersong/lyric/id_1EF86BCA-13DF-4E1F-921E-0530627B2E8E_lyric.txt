 You look so wonderful in your dress
I love  your hair like that
The way it falls on the side
Of  your neck
Down  your shoulders and back
We are surrounded
By all of these lies
And people who talk too much
 You've got that kind of  look
 In  your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want  you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that  you are is all
That I'll ever need
I'm  so  in love,  so  in love
 So  in love,  so  in love
 You  look  so beautiful  in this light
 Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue
 In  your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices
Surrounding us here
They just fade out
When  you take a breath
Just say the word
And I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want  you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that  you are is all
That I'll ever need
I'm  so  in love,  so  in love
 So  in love,  so  in love
Lumi¨¨re, darling
Lumi¨¨re over me
Lumi¨¨re, darling
Lumi¨¨re over me
Lumi¨¨re, darling
Lumi¨¨re over me
And should this be
The last thing I see
I want  you to know it's enough
For me
Cause all that  you are is all
That I'll ever need
I'm  so  in love,  so  in love
 So  in love, love, love, love,
 So  in love
 You  looked  so  wonderful
 In  your  dress
I loved  your hair like that
And  in the moment I knew  you back
