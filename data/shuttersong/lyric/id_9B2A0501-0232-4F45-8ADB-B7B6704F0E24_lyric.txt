Let's go move into my apartment (one day)
One look at her my heart was stopping (heartbreak)
I did whatever she was asking
She said: Maybe later catch you in the elevator
A couple days we got to hanging (real close)
Since now she wasn't even taken (oh, no)

I made a move, she said: Baby you're in mistaken, I'm not into bacon
She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind

And that's why it makes me cry

'Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl

She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh why?, tell me why did I fall for those eyes?

She said I was nice but she's not into guys
I found a girl
I should've know to walk away then
I should've left it alone
But when she called me on the phone
We'd be hanging again

I know we're pobably some friends
But now she only talks to me about some other woman, she said

She got that smile and that body is to die for

One of a kind
And that's why it makes me cry

'Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice but she's not into guys
I found a girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I found a girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't believe I met somebody like you
And now I'm feel like a fool
And that to me is so cruel
I can't believe it I just think like a man
That you just wanted me bad
But you had different plans
'Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice but she's not into guys
I found a girl
Found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice but she's not into guys
I found a girl.
