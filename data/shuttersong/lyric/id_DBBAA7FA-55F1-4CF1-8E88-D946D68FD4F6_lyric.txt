In my heart I can find
All the strength I need to go on
I am here, with this hope in my hands
And faith will guide me on

After the storm I will be fine again
The sun will come

I'll fly like a bird
I'll fly
Fly into the sky just to get
Where you are today
Emotions that are filling me until the very end of time

The lights shine from up here
There's a rainbow no more fear
All it takes, just the power of dreams
So dream along with me

So spread your wings and learn how to fly with me
There are no obstacles

I'll fly like a bird
I'll fly
Fly into the sky just to get
Where you are today
Emotions that are filling me until the very end of time
Until the very end of time
