Woke up on the balcony
Face up to the sky with the sun lookin' down at me
Standin' up and lookin' out I see
These houses in hills, it's a dream life reality
That's Cali, baby
Shit can get a little crazy
Yeah but that's how we prefer it so we do it on the daily
Young gun and gotta keep the fun comin'
And I'll never stop chasin' these dreams 'till I'm done runnin'

I'm gonna chase the day away
Ay, ay, ay
I'm gonna chase the day away
Ay, ay, ay

I see it in your eyes
It's the horizon and the pacific coast ocean we dive in
Movin', movin'
Over the sound we race cause memories of yesterday today we chase
The colors are beautiful, it's miraculous
And I know in the future I'll look back at this
And think of all the dumb shit we did and laugh at it
and smile at the love we made, that was passionate

I'm gonna chase the day away
Ay, ay, ay
I'm gonna chase the day away
Ay, ay, ay
And Imma have a place to stay
Ay, ay, ay
I'm gonna chase the day away
Ay, ay, ay

Woke up on a couch this morning
Today's a another day
Last night was the same old story
I couldn't feel my face

And we livin'
And we livin'
And we livin'
And we livin' so fast
And we livin'
And we livin'
And we livin'
And we livin' so fast

I'm gonna chase the day away
Ay, ay, ay
And Imma have a place to stay
Ay, ay, ay
I'm gonna chase the day away
Ay, ay, ay
