I gave you the key, when your door wasn't open
Just admit it
See i gave you faith, turned your doubt into hope and
You can't deny it
Now i'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me here
Where are you now that i need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that i need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, i didn't leave you
I was by your side
Where are you now that i need you?
Where are you now that i need you?
...
Where are you now that i need you?

Where are you now that i need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying, ohh
I gave you the shirt off my back what you saying
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh lord
...
Where are you now that i need you?

Where are you now that i need you?
