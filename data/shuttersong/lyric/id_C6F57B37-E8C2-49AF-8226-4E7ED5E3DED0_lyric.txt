My heart's a stere
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Gym Class Heroes, baby
If I was just another dusty record on the shelve
Will you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for make skipping tracks
This the last girl that play me, left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I sing a song and the image grab you by the head
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo, the only place for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you

Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo
Let's go!
If I wasn't old school, fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up before of the cops
And crank a higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
Will you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make

You never know we come and go like we're on a interstate
I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear it, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune

And know my heart is a stereo, the only place for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you

Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo
I only pray you never leave me behind
Because good music can be so hard to find
I'd take your head and hold it closer to mine

Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo
