I hear melodies in my head
Find little notes in my bed
I got songs tangled up in my head
I see pianos keys everywhere

My heart is a beating drum
Repeating my favorite song
I hear Beethoven number nine
All the time

And it's kinda like do-re-mi
About as easy as a-b-c
Beautiful like a symphony
I'm talking about you and me

I hear melodies in my head
Hear melodies in my head
I was little off key then you
Melodine me and I'm better than ever

I hear melodies in my head I hear melodies in my head
I had the beat a bit wrong,
But I got a new song now,

So I put my headphones on
Plug into you
Plug into you
Boy you're my favourite song,
Plug into you
Plug into you

Oh-woah-oh
You're so wrong
That it makes you right
Keep me, wide awake at night

I can't sleep now I know you're around
I'll like listening and singing every sound
I love it when I hear your voice
Oh baby

I don't think we really got a choice
Mozart is in the air, and I'm right here
And it's kinda like do-re-mi
About as easy as a-b-c

Beautiful like a symphony
I'm talking about you and me
I hear melodies in my head.
I hear melodies in my head

I was little off key and you
Melodine and I'm better than ever
I hear melodies in my head
Hear melodies in my head

I had the beat a bit wrong,
But, I got a new song now
So I put my headphones on
Plug into you
Plug into you
Boy you're my favorite song

Plug into you
Plug into you
I wake up in the middle of the night
Can't stop for the melodies that I hear

The melodies baby I hear
Melodies all the time, and I'm about to go crazy
Keep on singing I'm about to see you baby

You're my melodie
And I - I hear melodies in my heart
I hear melodies in my heart
Keep the melodies in my head
I was little odd keep and you
Never die me and I'm better than ever
I hear melodies in my heart
Keep the melodies in my head
I have to be wrong but
I got a new song now
So I put my headphones on
Plug into you
Plug into you
So you're my favorite song
Talking to you
Talking to you
