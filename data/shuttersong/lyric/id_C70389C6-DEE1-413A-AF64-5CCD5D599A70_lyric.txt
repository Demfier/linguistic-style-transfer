Move, move moving on
Grow, grow growing up
It's time to face the truth
Don't think of it as a door thats shut

I just need to say
Before you go away

This is home
It's made of us,
Not the bricks but love and trust
Time has come and change we must,
We're the heart we're not the dust

We won't let go go go

Try, try, try enough,
To make sense of where you are
You're only 3 miles down the road,
But you're a world away my Mollie Rose
I just need to say
Before you go away

This is home
It's made of us,
Not the bricks but love and trust
Time has come and change we must,
We're the heart we're not the dust
You're in our blood, you'll never fade
Though I'll miss you let's celebrate
The times we shared they'll still remain
You've got a whole new life to make

But don't let go go go go
You have to go go go
We won't let go go go

You're in our blood, you'll never fade
Though I'll miss you let's celebrate

This is home
It's made of us,
Not the bricks but love and trust
Time has come and change we must,
We're the heart we're not the dust
You're in our blood, you'll never fade
Though I'll miss you let's celebrate
The times we shared they'll still remain
You've got a whole new life to make
