Out of the depths I shout to You
unable to see Your design
I keep my contemp to comfort in
and swim in my sin laiden grime
out of the depths I cling to You
soften this hard heart of mine
give me the joy to realize
You test me like gold to refine
I trust in Your Love everlasting
I cling to Your unfailing Grace
in seasons of sorrow and blessing
I give You my pain and my praise
You undying mercy awaits
out of the depths I hold on to
the faith that sustains through the wake
how soon I forget the gifts that You give
and focused on that which You take
out of the depths I cry to You
only on You can I call
Mercy Awaits, You promise me
no matter what storm may be strong
I trust in Your Love everlasting
I cling to Your unfailing Grace
in seasons of sorrow and blessing
I give You my pain and my praise
You undying mercy awaits
I trust in Your Love everlasting
I cling to Your unfailing Grace
in seasons of sorrow and blessing
I give You my pain and my praise
You undying mercy awaits...
