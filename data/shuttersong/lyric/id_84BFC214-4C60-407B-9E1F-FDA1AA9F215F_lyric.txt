Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know
You're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
Would you take away my hopes and dreams
And just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me
You'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls or leave
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me
You'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling out drunk
Getting myself lost
I am so gone
So tell me the way you home
I listen to sad songs
Singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me 
You'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
