I am the diamond you left in the dust
I am the future you lost in the past
Seems like I never compared
Would notice if I disappeared

You stole the love that I saved for myself
And I watched
You give it to somebody else
But these scars no longer I hide
I found the light you shut inside

Couldn't love me if you tried
Am I still not good enough
Am I still not worth that much
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out sorry for the smile I'm wearing now guess I'm still not good enough
Does it burn knowing I used all the pain

Does it hurt knowing you're fuel to my flame
Don't look back
Don't need your regrets
Thank God you left my love behind
Couldn't change me if you tried
Am I still not good enough
Am I still not worth that much
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out sorry for the smile I'm wearing now guess I'm still not good enough

Release your curse 'cause I know my worth
Those wounds you made are gone you ain't seen nothing yet
Your love wore thin and I never win
You want the best so sorry that's clearly not me
This is all I can be
Am I still not good enough
Am I still not worth that much
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out sorry for the smile I'm wearing now guess I'm still not good enough
