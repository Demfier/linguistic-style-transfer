ll give you these wings, but just don't fly away

Yeah sammy yeah
You're like a diamont in the rough
Shining brighter than a rising sun
Can I get enough
Like a fiend needing drugs again
Dreams are making love in the middle of the caribbean
Lay back in the sun while I grab the weed and roll it up
This love is for you
And this heart is for you
Why not take a chance while we still have our youth
Guess only time will tell now
So tell me how youfell about me
Ohhh

The way she roll that bob marley got me coming in a hot pursuit
She got a smoking hot body, just to compliment that attitude
Alright

All I do throw signs your way
Are you catching my vibe
Girl I don't mind the wait
Tell me when it's time
We'll sip slow by the bay
I'll give you these wings but just don't fly away

Oh don't flay away, from me girl
Me and this girl went out to the ocean
On a summer day
The wind in our hair
Our bodies in motion
Don't know what to say
I asked for the ligth with the blunt in my hand
Sun high in the sky while our feet in the sand

The way she roll that bob marley
Got me coming in a hot pursuit
She got a smoking hot body, just to compliment that attitude
Alrigth now

All I do is throw signs your way
Are you catching my vibe
Girl I don't mind the wait
Tell me when it's time
We'll sip slow by the bay
I'll give you these wings
But just don't fly away

I'll give you these wings now, yeah
There's something bout you
That I can't quite put my finger on
It's summertime baby the spring is gone
You should just follow my lead like it's a singalone
You tell me I can't handle you I tell you bring it on
Bring it on
I'm up for the challenge
If it results in my cuffing the baddest
I'll teach you to surf upon these waves
I promise it's nothing but balance
You're feeling my vibe
I'm getting you high
We up in the attic
Me and my girl yeah we only puffing the fattest
Yeah

The way she roll that bob marley
Got me coming in a hot pursuit
(Yeah she do every time now)
She got a smoking hot body, just to compliment that attitude

All I do is throw signs your way
Are you catching my vibe
Girl I don't mind the wait
Tell me when it's time
We'll sip slow by the bay
I'll guve you these wings
But just don't fly away
