I have tried but he doesn't love me
He doesn't love me.
I should cry but my blue eyes are dry
I'm dying inside
But I'm still alive.

He's giving me signs
But I'm a blind.
Is he looking at me
Or the girl behind?
My mind is in knots
I can't untie.
Be mine
This time.

Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.
Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.

I have tried but he doesn't love me
He doesn't love me.
I say hi with the sun in my eyes
I cant tell if he's smiling
I love when he's smiling.

I can't compete
With no one else.
He's thinking of me
When he's by himself.
Will he want me more
If I look away
And play his game?

Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.
Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.

There's something about you
Oh oh oh
There's something about you
Oh oh oh ohohoh
Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.

Girls and boys
Lost in love.
Girls and boys
Lost in love
Girls and boys
Lost in love
Girls and boys
Lost in love

Oh oh
ohohohoh
oh oh oh
theres something about you

Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.
Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.
Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.
(I hate you but I love you)
Boy oh Boy oh boy
I hate you but I love you.
(I hate you but I love you)
I have tried but he doesn't love me
He doesn't love me.
