When your legs don't work
Like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember
The taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
Darlin' I will
Be lovin' you
Till we're seventy
Baby my heart
Could still fall as hard
At twenty three
When my hair's all but gone
And my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands
Don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul could never grow old
It's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right
Where we are
I'm thinking out loud
Uhh we found love right
Where we are
We found love right
Where we are
