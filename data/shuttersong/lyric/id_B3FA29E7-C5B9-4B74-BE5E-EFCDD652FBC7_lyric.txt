Yo, them man know I'm not here to play the game
I'm here to change it
And with change, come questions
Watch this

I hear man have been asking man about me
Questioning my whole team
Asking man if the tings got bodies - don't question what you can't see
Please don't touch what you can't reach
And miss me with the bad boy speech
Man came from selling OZ's, to running a business - And now I keep the receipts
I was a bad boy back in 03'
Locked up back in 06'
I robbed man but I never lost sleep
And now I got more legal money that I got bricks
I've had more vehicles than you've had chicks
They said I made my money on YouTube
But I've done more robberies than vids'
And I've took more drug money than I took pics

They don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
But then I just stopped, and then I look back
And still nobody got near, nobody got near

I come from the bottom where there's nothing but mud
Turned OZ's into boxes of bud
Turns out water is thicker than blood
So I'm talking to B'Loke about the hood
Told him I'll lick man down if I could
But he told me I made way too much money this year
to be chatting like a reckless thug
I'm chatting like I don't live good
Like I have to address these scruffs
I don't care if there's been a drought in the bits - round here there's been a flood
I told Darkee to go get a crib - forget the roads for a minute and lets live
Then I thought, wait
What about when my man gets out?
Fuck it, It is what it is

They don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
But then I just stopped, and then I look back
And still nobody got near, nobody got near

Can a real nigga respect a snitch? - No
Can a fake nigga try it with [?]? - No
Can you have family in the police force and still represent the bits? - No
Them man are washed up now its a minor
They're on a swegway, I'm on a night rider
They can keep coming and coming and coming
But how can a meerkat fight with a tiger?
They need me cause they know i'm in a different league, different league, different league
Last year man made about 100G's
I let them make music based on me
I'm like a sawn-off shotgun, letting off ball bearings
Them man are letting off a BB
I'm on your radio and your explorer page and your mind and more time on your TV

They don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
But then I just stopped, and then I look back
And still nobody got near, nobody got near

I rolled up and told her she's better without me
Took of my trainer
Took of my tracksuit
I left the house and jumped in my Audi
Next time I seen her was on Facebook, with her holding her boyfriends hand so proudly
But she's constantly turning the radio down when the radio is talking about me

Love is a funny thing when they love you, but you don't love them
I don't need their adult problems
I tell a lie
I got one I love, the rest I don't want
The funny thing i just like knowing that I could have got them
I told her I'll settle down
But not right now, cause I'm not here too often

But I think she forgets that when I'm not here, when I'm not here, when I'm not here
I think she forgets that when I'm not here, when I'm not here, when I'm not here
I think she forgets that when I went clear, when I went clear, when I went clear
That was the plan
And I won't stop till I'm a legend out here, legend out here
