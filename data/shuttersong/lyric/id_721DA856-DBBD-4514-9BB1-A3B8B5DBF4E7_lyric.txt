Yo, I'm a quick learner
Trap it up, don't let the bitch burn ya
If you smokey, don't be playing with me
On Fridays I be big worming
On Sundays I think I'm Richard Sherman
Block the pass and then I make the earnings
Bounce your head and that's for every person
From the hood up to the damn suburbans
I'm getting fly bitch, close the curtains
Me, you and this Hennessy got me Lil Durkin'
Tryna make it perfect, is it working?
Making money got me waking early
I don't even gotta throttle my hand, I continue to grow while y'all walk around me
That's just motivation, send a notification like
