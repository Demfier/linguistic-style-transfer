Woo-ooo-ooh, woo-ooo-ooh, woo-ooo-ooh

Well I met you yesterday
You took my breath away.
And I kinda like the way that you're so damn unpredictable.

That was just history
It turned into you and me.
It happened so easily, like i'm livin' some kind of miracle.

The world keeps spinning
It won't stop, it's just beginning.

Cause I got high hopes, high hopes.
high hopes for me and you.
And when we grow old, I'll say "I told you so"
Cause i got high (high, high) hopes.

Woo-ooo-ooh, woo-ooo-ooh, woo-ooo-ooh

I can move in with you
And we could get married too.
Go on our honeymoon
maybe we should finish this coffee first.

It might sound a little weird
It's like I've known you for years.
So every word you hear might just sound a little over rehearsed.

The world keeps spinning
It won't stop, it's just beginning.

Cause I got high hopes, high hopes.
high hopes for me and you.
And when we grow old, I'll say "I told you so"
Cause i got high (high, high) hopes.
¡°
Cause i got high (high, high) hopes.

The word keeps spinning
It wont stop, it's just beginning.
Cause I got high hopes, high hopes
High hopes for me and you, (for me and you yeah baby)
When we grow old, i'll say "I told you so."
Cause i got high, (high, high)
I got high hopes, high hopes
High hopes for me and you, (for me and you yeah baby)
When we grow old, i'll say "I told you so."
