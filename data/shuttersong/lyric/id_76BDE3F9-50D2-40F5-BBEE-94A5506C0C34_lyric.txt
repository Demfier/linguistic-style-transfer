Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
No, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
A loser hides behind
a mask of my disguise
And who I am today
is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So, I'm taking this moment to live in the future
Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried a suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're
Messin' with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone
Only if you understand.
(Hey, hey, hey, hey,)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey.)
No, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You don't know my brain
the way you know my name
You don't know my heart
the way you know my face
You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future
Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried a suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're
Messing with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone
Only if you understand.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
My people singing
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
My people singing.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
Hope you're dead, cause how can you sleep at a time like this
People they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets, wrote this in three minutes
Three words to a line, it's just poetry divided
I'm the kind of guy who takes every moment he knows he can fight it
And music to use it for others to use it.
You're dead cause how can you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here, but you comment below
And comments below has become common motivation
To promote your show's next episode so your brain knows to keep going
Even though hope, is far from this moment
But you and I know, it gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember; the morning is when night is dead.
Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried a suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're
Messing with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone
Only if you understand.
Please use discretion when you're
Messing with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone
Only few understand.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
My people singing
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
My people singing.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
My people singing.
