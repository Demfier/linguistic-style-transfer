Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Never dies
Tomorrow never dies
Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Never dies

Life can be so hard to breathe when you're trapped inside a box
You're waiting for a break to come, it always comes too late (woah)
You're on the edge, stumbling' and the road it starts to wind
But every time a page is turned a chance to make it right

Oh the sun will rise
Like a flame ignites
We're not done
Til we say it's over
We won't fade away
Oh the sun will rise
Tomorrow never dies

Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Tomorrow never dies

It's hard to see the enemy when you're looking at yourself
Maybe your reflection shows, you're screaming out for help (woah)
And you try your best to just keep up, and your feet they fall behind
But the beat you're marching to, you're keeping perfect time

Oh the sun will rise
Like a flame ignites
We're not done
Til we say it's over
We won't fade away
Oh the sun will rise
Tomorrow never dies

Try your best to change your fate
You can just enjoy the ride
The sun will rise, the moon will fall
Tomorrow never dies (it never dies)

Oh the sun will rise (the sun will rise, the sun will rise)
Like a flame ignites (the flame ignites, the flame ignites)
We're not done
Til we say it's over
We won't fade away
Oh the sun will rise
Tomorrow never dies

Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Tomorrow never dies

Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Never dies, never dies, no (woah, woah)
Tomorrow never dies
