Turn a half to a whole thing
With cocaina you will make a name
If you wanna make a mountain
Gotta turn that kitchen to a hurricane
Trapping out the boarded houses
Don't go check the door without John Wayne
All white bricks, plain Jane
Have you ever seen a drop before?
Have you ever seen a drought? (hell nah)
Have you ever seen a pot before?
Fishscale jumping out
Everybody know cocaina make the whole world turn around
Out of Venezuela talking cocaina with the plug right now

No cop whip it like a shelf
Cut that profit like, yeah
Throttled up look like a crocker
Got some bad hoes up in here rappin'
Got some crosses round my neck like pastors
Fuck a father like son, bitch, we bastards (fuck em)
Got some baking soda, that's what sells a plug
I wanna see some heels, cooking make me love
Yeah, I got that dope like pieces, I would love to meet ya
I done beat it, beat it, now she say she bleeding

Don't mislead her, treat her now she knows it's easy
She know it's easy yea

Actavis ‘cause we don't drink that wise shit
They talking about the Migos we spreading like we a virus
Thinking about running up on me, think I'm sweet, I wouldn't advise it
Diamonds build our temperature up, fucking run it to the closet
Chopper make you do whatever I say niggas call me Simon
When they growing all pinocchio, nigga, but I ain't lying
Most of these bitches ain't mine, I fuck them then move down the line
See that cocaina gon' bring you to crime
And that cocaina gon' start bringing the fire
But get caught with that cocaina get time
You been fucking up and run at the wrong time

It can be a crumb they gon' charge you like it's a dime
Looking at my neck and wrist like why I can't shine
Looking at the IA like why can't I rise?
Cocaina come out the boat and it's certified
