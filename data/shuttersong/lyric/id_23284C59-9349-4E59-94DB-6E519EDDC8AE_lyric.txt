swimming/
I wish I was swimming/
I wish I was swimming/
I wish I was/
I wishawishawishawas/

bring your mask and snorkel/
bring the flippers also/
bring the frisbee baby/
bring something to drink/
bring your purple bathing suit/
depends on where we're going to/
if we're going to that swimming hole/
we son't need nothing at all/
some warm clothes to jump into/
or we could air dry/
I'll do the cannon ball/
if you do your swan dive/
you can plash me if you want to ///
but not in the eye/

chorus

somewhere in the well kept secrets/
I'll never tell where the rope swing is/
ooo waawww ooo waawww
somewhere in the well kept secrets/
you'll never tell where the rope swing is where to hold on/
when to let go/
swing out/
give out a yell/
you'll never hit bottom/
you'll never grow tired/
of this wonder you're under/
water
