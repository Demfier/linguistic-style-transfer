She says she wants to end it all when she's all alone in her room
She cries
The way she feels inside
Is too much for her
When you all got is these four walls

It's not that hard to feel so small
Or even exist at all
How come no one heard her when she said
Maybe I'm better off dead
If I was, would it finally be enough?
To shut out all these voices in my head
Maybe I'm better off dead
Better off dead

Did you hear a word

Hear a word I said
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
(gone gone)

This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

She doesn't know she's beautiful
'Cause no one's ever told her so
And the demons that she hides
Are all she knows

Maybe she could fall in love

With someone in her life that she could trust
And tell her she's enough (Will someone tell her she's enough?)

How come no one heard her when she said?

Maybe I'm better off dead
If I was, would it finally be enough?
To shut out all these voices in my head
Maybe I'm better off dead
Better off dead

Did you hear a word
Hear a word I said
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When all you got is these four walls
It's not that hard to feel so small
When all you got is these four walls
It's not that hard to feel so small
All she wanted was to be enough
All she wanted was to be enough
What does it take?
Maybe it's not too late
Yeah no one heard her when she said
Maybe I'm better off dead
If I was, would it finally be enough?
To shut out all these voices in my head
Maybe I'm better off dead
Better off dead
Did you hear a word
Hear a word I said
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
(Gone gone)
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
(Gone gone)
This is not where I belong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
