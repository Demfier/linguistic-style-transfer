Oh, yeah.

I've been thinking now for a while.

With you, I've got exactly what I need.
When I see you stop and turnin' around.
And now you've got me shaking in my teeth.

I can't afford the kind of love you sell
But I can't afford to ever watch you leave.
Won't you come and put your sugar on my tongue.
You've got your spell on me.

And how could I leave this life to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I said.
And how could I leave your heart to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I did.

I'm the only one who knows
The secret places that the lights don't show.
(The lights don't show)

No!

I can't afford the kind of love you own
But I sure as hell could never let you go.
Every time I start to tell you no
And then you go and take off all your clothes.

And how could I leave this life to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I said.
And how could I leave your heart to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I've done.

Those things that I've done.

Yeah!
I know what no one else knows.
Sure as hell can never let you go.

No, I won't let you
Go.

Hey! Hey!
Move!
And how could I leave this life to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I've said.
And how could I leave your heart to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I've done.
And how could I leave this life to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I've said.
And how could I leave your heart to another one.
Take back; I'll take back those things that I've done.
Oh!
