Rap around, open arms
and let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
We ain't got to talk about love no more
We ain't got to talk about love no more
Just let me feel your love
Let me feel your love!

Times aren't that bad
Of course you're making me mad driving me crazy
Oh no no no, I wouldn't change it
Baby I guess, I guess, I guess were drinking for the hell of it, yelling shit
I don't even know the melody, no energy
Been listening for the whole night
What we do I guess it's alright
We've been treating everyday like it's a holiday
My mama said work hard, but I gotta play!
'Cause we're doing it, it's alright
Listen to this whole night

Wrap around, open arms
and let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
We ain't got to talk about love no more
We ain't got to talk about love no more
Just let me feel your love
Let me feel your love!

Times aren't that bad
Of course you're making me mad driving me crazy
Oh no no no, I wouldn't change it
Baby don't go!

Why why why why you're always on your phone?
I can't get with it, I'm yelling shit
Oh no, you say she a relative, I bet she is
We said nothing for the whole night
I can't do this here all night
Get something that no other here could ever give
Me and you against the world, we are some rebel shit
Uhm, but I know I'll be alright
But I can't do this all night.

Rap around, open arms
and let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
We ain't got to talk about love no more
We ain't got to talk about love no more
Just let me feel your love
Let me feel your love!
Let me feel your love!
Let me feel your love!
Let me feel your love!
Let me feel your love!
