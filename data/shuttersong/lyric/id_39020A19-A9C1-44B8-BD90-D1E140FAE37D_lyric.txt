So much pressure
Why so loud?
If you don't like my sound
You can turn it down

I got a road
And I walk it alone

Uphill battle
I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious, precocious
I get braggadocios

I'm not gonna stop
I like the view from the top (Yeah)

You talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah shit
And I'm so done, I'm so over it
Sometimes I mess up, I f*$% up, I hit and miss
But I'm okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greats
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, aaah
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, aaah

Those who mind don't matter
Those who matter, don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing
Then I'll leave you behind

Gone in a flash
And I ain't living like that

They talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah shit
Roll with the punches, and take the hits
Sometimes I mess up, I f*$% up, I swing and miss
But it's okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greats
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, aaah
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, aaah

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
Masterpiece, masterpiece (Yeeah)

I still fall on my face sometimes (still fall)
And I can't colour inside the lines (inside the lines)
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete (perfectly incomplete)
I'm still working on my masterpiece (on my masterpiece)
And I, I wanna hang with the greats (oh, with the greats)
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait, no (wait, no)
You haven't seen the best of me (b-b-best of me)
I'm still working on my masterpiece (I'm still working on my masterpiece)

Oooh, oooh (Yeeah)
Oooh, aaah (Hey)
Oooh, oooh (Still working on, still working on)
Oooh, aaah (Still working on my masterpiece)
