Before I start just let me say
You make the baddest bitch look good any day
I wont forget the day you rescued me
The day your true colours came out to play

Did anybody tell you
You look better with your makeup on
Did anybody tell you
You don't matter to me anymore
I was your joke
You were my heart
You played me well like a deck of cards
I see the tears run down your face
What you think my mind is gonna change
And I'm like...

No no no no no no no
You're gonna have to let this go
Didn't wanna say I told you so oh oh
But someone had to let you know
And if you think your tears are gonna change my mind
I'm not gonna waste your time
I'll remind you
What I told you
You'd be laughing until you cry

I told ya

You'd be la -a -aughing till you cry cry back to me
You'd be la -a -aughing till you cry cry back to me

Before you go let me explain
With you I lost way more than I ever gained
And now you're crying back to me what a shame
You had the best and now the worst has come your way

Did anybody tell you
You look better with your makeup on
Did anybody tell you
You don't matter to me anymore
I was your joke
You were my heart
You played me well like a deck of cards
I see the tears run down your face
What you think my mind is gonna change
And I'm like...

No no no no no no no
You're gonna have to let this go
Didn't wanna say I told you so oh oh
But someone had to let you know
And if you think your tears are gonna change my mind
I'm not gonna waste your time
I'll remind you
What I told you
You'd be laughing until you cry

I told ya

You'd be la -a -aughing till you cry cry back to me
You'd be la -a -aughing till you cry cry back to me

If you think I'd take you back you must be dreamin'
(your dreamin')
If you think I'd understand I've got no reason
(no reason)
And if you think that this ain't fair take what your given
I knew there would be a time you would cry back to me
