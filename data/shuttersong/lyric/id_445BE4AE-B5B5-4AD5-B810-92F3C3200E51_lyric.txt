I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Da da da da da da
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rap of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealing
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never lived to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if its true
If it's you, what you say in your raps is what you do
So they feel, it's part of ya obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets face to face are you for real?
The confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, you can conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it
'Til its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
I'm a soldier
(these shoulders hold up so much,
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up)
I'm a soldier
(even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble)

I love pissing you off, it get's me off
Like my lawyers, when the fucking judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'm violating. All the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch is news
Pistol whipping mother fuckin' bouncer 6'2\
