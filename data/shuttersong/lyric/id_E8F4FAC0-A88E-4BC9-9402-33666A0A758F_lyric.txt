Lift me up - David Guetta
Inside a soul
There's a hero to discover
There's no way we can triumph
Without struggle
I'm just like you
Why you trying to be bring me down
I'm just like you help me turn
This thing around
I dream at night  Of a better day
You and I  In a better place
Don't know how 
But I'll know that I'll reach it
Don't know when 
But I know that we'll meet there
Lift me up 
Don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down
Don't bring me down
Lift me up 
Don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down
Don't bring me down
Lift me up to higher ground
Not too proud to say I need you now
Lift me up 
Don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down
Don't bring me down
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Yeah yeah yeah
Don't bring me down
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Yeah yeah yeah
Don't bring me down
We're meant to be here
For one another
Don't forget you're my sister
You're my brother
I'm just like you
I got troubles of my own
Just like you I'm trying to make it home
I dream at night 
Of a better day
You and I 
In a better place
Don't know how 
But I'll know that I'll reach it
Don't know when 
But I know that we'll meet there
Lift me up 
Don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down
Don't bring me down
Lift me up 
Don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down
Don't bring me down
Lift me up to higher ground
Not too proud to say I need you now
Lift me up 
Don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down
Don't bring me down
