We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hair pins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

If you want we'll help tonight to split his seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams

I won't be smilin' but the notes
From my admirers fill the dashboard just the same
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out

White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hair pins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
and there's nothing here to stop

To stop us when
We're up for it
I know you love it when the hair pins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods

and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this
(And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could)

I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, they way they seem
It's something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights
in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing and love it
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could
We got the glow in our mouths...
White teeth teens are out...
White teeth teens are out
