Take your nose of my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of uuu
What you following me for?
This aint no f-ckin sing-along
So girl what you singing for?
Keep me blowing like c4
Got my whole crew blowing like a c4
20's keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's and the trash we going, straight to the top
Rooftop close with a harm of girls and they all so foreign
Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light skinned chick first flights from Poland
A whole lot of friends first flights from Poland
A whole lot of girls coming straight from Poland

Why?
Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew 
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

They loving the crew
They lovinng the dadadadada
