You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in the form of Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it be mindful of the speakers please
Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms, break the sound
Feel the embraceful pound
Treat all the things profound
If you wanna dude to help you out

From El Segundo to Toronto

But I'd never say who unless my name was Tanto
Yup, you know how the date rape go

Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on the door like we \
