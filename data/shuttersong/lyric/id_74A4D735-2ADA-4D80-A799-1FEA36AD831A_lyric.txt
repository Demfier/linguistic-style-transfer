Experts at eighteen,
With warm beer and caffeine
We spoke all night and hang out due to first light would come
We knew it was over, the morning came sober
We said goodbye and then we smiled trough a lie, just thinkin'

All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head
And although this is the end,
Broken hearts are meant to mend

And I know we'll meet again

Days turn to weeks, yeah
We all cut our teeth, so
We're keeping touch although we don't talk much
I knew we'll find out some new friends
Life changes, it happens

But we're still crazy for those good old days we had,
Just singing

All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head (Ooh, yeah)
And although this is the end,
Broken hearts are meant to mend
And I know we'll meet again
Along the road
Oh oh oh ooh

Oh oh oh ooh
Oh oh oh ooh
Along the road

Some will lose their way,
Vanish in the ha-aaaaze
But as the sun goes down,
I sometimes think about
Yeah yeah!
All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head
And although this is the end,
Broken hearts are meant to mend
And I know we'll meet again
Along the road
All the words we never said
All the crazy things we did
Keep on playin' in my head
(I know, yeah)

And although this is the end,
Broken hearts are meant to mend
And I know we'll meet again
Along the road

Oh oh oh ooh
Oh oh oh ooh
Oh oh oh ooh
Along the road
