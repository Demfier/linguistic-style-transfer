Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (eh, eh)
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland...
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland...

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with the cheshire cat's smile
Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
We found wonderland

You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (eh, eh)
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland...
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
In wonderland...
I reach for you

But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad
Oooooh!

We found wonderland

You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland...)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland...
