You call and tell me that you are lonely
Voice mentally clear and I can't hear you
It's 2 a.m and the bars close you're open
You're hoping that I will take over for you

I won't hold your hands
When you are lonely
When you wound me
When you got nothing to do
And breaks your heart
I am not lonely
And I don't break like I used to

- Mala Rodriguez:
Me equivoco por deporte, donde esta lo sabio?
El unico riesgo es volverse loco
Dejale en el corte, cambio
Conocerme mejor improvisando
Sujeta al antojo del pizado
No digas nada q te condene
Hechos hablen notas suenen sin control
Lo peor de cada uno se viene

Nunca creas que sabes demasiado
Hay cientos en los juzgados solias
Deberias desprogramarme y olvidar
Pero estamos mal educados
Toma la manzana te dije de buen grado
Aun no me siento culpable de haberte liberado
Solo estoy buscando
Me uso y te uso y parece que nunca es demasiado

I won't hold your hands
When you are lonely
When you wound me
When you got nothing to do
And breaks your heart
I am not lonely
And I don't break like I used to

I used to make you go crazy
So now you knock on my door
I see my phone on the table
You are the picture before
And I can't just picture it now
And it's not what I used to see
Tonight you will find a replacement
And I know you will picture me

I won't hold your hands
When you are lonely
When you wound me
When you got nothing to do
And breaks your heart
And breaks your heart
I don't break like I used to

I won't hold your hands
When you are lonely
When you wound me
When you got nothing to do
And breaks your heart
I am not lonely
And I don't break like I used to

Like it used to
Like it used to
Like it used to
Break it like we used to

Like it used to
Like it used to
Like it used to
Break it like we used to
