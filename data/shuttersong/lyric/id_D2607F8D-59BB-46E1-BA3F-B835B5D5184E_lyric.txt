I need your love
I need your love
I need your lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you oh-oh oh
If I love ya love me right back
That kind of love that keep you coming back
If i love ya love me right back
Don't ever leave me, girl don't do me that
So please (stay) Don't walk (away)
Give me another chance, me love you the right (way)
My true feelings pushing up
Woman you love me, can't do without
Who am I without you by my side?
Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark
Wishing I could hold you now...
When you were here for me I was not there for you
I was too blind, couldn't see what you did for me
Now i don't know what to do
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be right here for you.
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be calling out for you, can you here me?
