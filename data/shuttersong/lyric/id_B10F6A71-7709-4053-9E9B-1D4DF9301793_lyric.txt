In this context, there's no disrespect
So, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect collect the rhythm effect
To lose this inhibition, follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
Coz when we beat out, girl it's pullin' without
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out!
Burn it till it's burned out
Turn it till it's turned out
Act up from North, West, East and South!

Everybody, everybody, let's get into it (Yeah), get stupid (C'mon)

Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Ya'll here a body, two pieces to it
Get started, get stupid
You'll want me body people will walk you through it
Step by step, like you're into new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transit hits, with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'
