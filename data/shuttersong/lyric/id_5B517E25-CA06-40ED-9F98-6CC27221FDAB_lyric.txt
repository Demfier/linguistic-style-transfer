Please, Lay a Little Longer
The Weight is on my Shoulder, Holding me down
Some days it cant get much darker
feeling more than ever
when your not around

When i think about love,
You are right beside me
Oh i think about us,
You will always find me
My heart is lost,
i know that you'll guide me
I think about all the little things that still Remind Me.

These days
reflections like a stranger
You were so much braver,
Braver than me,
oh, save me
Save me from my demons, teach me to defeat them
and leave me to piece.

When i think about love,
You are right beside me
Oh i think about us,
You will always find me
My heart is lost,
i know that you'll guide me
I think about all the little things that still Remind Me.

When im living life there's nothing left to lose
When i turn my back on everything i do
When i set upon the silence in a room
oh oh, Remind me
Remind Me
Remind Me
Remind Me, of yo--u
So i think about love,
and you're right beside me
i think about us,
i know that you'll always find me
My heart gets lost,
i know that you'll guide me
I think about all the little things that still Remind Me.
I think about all the little things that still Remind Me.

All my life, you'll remind me
