Started low
Got lost along the way, too young to know
That everything would change if we let go
So don't let go

I hear it loud
A heart beating to a different sound
Riding high on things we haven't found
Now we're not coming down

Oh, we're not coming down

Oh, if you only get it right
You're wasting, you're wasting time
And if you try to win my fight
You're wasting, you're wasting mine
Picking up the pace when you're moving slow
But running only takes you the long way home
I wish I'd known right from the start
When times get hard
Getting lost is the best part

Hold my breath
Sick of leaving all these words unsaid
Tired of sleeping in my restless head
Let's do it all again

Oh, let's do it all again

Oh, if you only get it right
You're wasting, you're wasting time
And if you try to win my fight
You're wasting, you're wasting mine
Picking up the pace when you're moving slow
But running only takes you the long way home
I wish I'd known right from the start
When times get hard
Getting lost is the best part

Let's go back to the start
Back to the heart of this
The start of this
Let's run right through the dark
Right to the start of this
The heart of this

Oh, if you only get it right
You're wasting, you're wasting time
And if you try to win my fight
You're wasting, you're wasting mine
Picking up the pace when you're moving slow
But running only takes you the long way home
I wish I'd known right from the start
When times get hard
