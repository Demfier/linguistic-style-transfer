If you could be me
And see what I see
Just take a breath and you'll know what I mean
I'll always be yours
I'll always be yours

You're like the sound playing to me
And I wanna follow in sweet harmony
I'll always be yours
I'll always be yours

You set light to the darkness
Give life to the heartless
And I, I, I, I'll always be yours
You're a home to the homeless
Give hope to the hopeless
And I, I, I, I'll always be yours

That very first day you were alone
You were diamond surrounded by stones
I'll always be yours
I'll always be yours

When nothing remains and faces will change
The view from my heart will still stay the same
I'll always be yours
I'll always be yours

You set light to the darkness
Give life to the heartless
And I, I, I, I'll always be yours
You're a home to the homeless
Give hope to the hopeless
And I, I, I, I'll always be yours

Oh
And I, I, I, 'll always be yours

You've given me all that I need
But most of all, you've inspired me
I'll always be yours
I'll always be yours

You set light to the darkness
Give life to the heartless
And I, I, I, I'll always be yours
You're a home to the homeless
Give hope to the hopeless
And I, I, I, I'll always be yours

Oh
And I, I, I, 'll always be yours
Oh
And I, I, I, 'll always be yours
Oh
And I, I, I, 'll always be yours
