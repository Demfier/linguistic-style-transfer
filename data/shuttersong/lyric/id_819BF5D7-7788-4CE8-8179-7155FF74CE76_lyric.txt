Melbourne sound we ain't fucking around
Fuck these radio tracks, see we keep it underground
Cause work these days has me feelin' like shit
But it's all worthwhile when the weekends like this
Man i'm off-guard running amuck at lady luck
Then it's Satday, never a sober at Korova
Weekend come close coming to an end
With a fuck am i heading, heading to revs

It's Melbourne, the best scene on the earth
Best sound, slash drugs and we're living it first
Turn it down, no cunt, you better turn it up
And if they try to turn it off? Tell 'em get fucked!
Tuesday feeling better, Wednesday looking bright
Thursday can't wait and Fridays tonight
So fuck work, fuck the mix and better the music

Listen to the drop and FUCKING LOSE IT

Melbourne sound we ain't fucking around
Fuck these radio tracks, see we keep it underground
Cause work these days has me feelin' like shit
But it's all worthwhile when the weekends like this

Melbourne sound we ain't fucking around
Fuck these radio tracks, see we keep it underground
Cause work these days has me feelin' like shit
But it's all worthwhile when the weekends like this
It's Friday feelin' different at the makers of mischief
Saturday feelin' fine i'm heading to cloud nine
Week come close what am i gonna do
It's Sunday get reading i'm heading to TFU
Fuck work Fuck them x8
Fuck work x8
LISTEN TO THE DROP AND FUCKING LOSE IT
