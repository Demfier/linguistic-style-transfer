It's a long road
And it get's windy
Fog is real low
And it's so blinding

Oh I'm trying to steer
Trying to take the lead
But I feel like
The road is steering me

Getting so lost
Like a castaway
Feeling so crossed
Like a renegade

And I'm trying to call out
In the big city
Just a small voice
And no one's listening to me
Oh oh

Tell me where to go
Tell me that you know
Just how bright I glow

Every time
That you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights

Every time
That you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights

So shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, ooh

Oh I'm blending in
And I'm sticking out
Like a sore thumb
That they don't know about

Wanna make peace
Wanna just breathe
Wanna be the light
That makes them all believe

I'm the race car
Not the spectator
I'm the hero
Not the narrator
Hercules, battling, conquering everything, yeah
Oh oh

Tell me where to go
Tell me that you know
Just how bright I glow

Every time
That you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights, you're the city lights

Every time
That you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights

That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, ooh

Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights
Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights
Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights
Everybody knows
That everybody glows
Like the city lights

The city lights oh oh
Oooh the city lights ooooh

Every time
That you think you've lost your shine
Just remember nothing's brighter
You're the city lights, you're the city lights

Every time
That you fade into the night
Just remember you're the fire
You're the city lights

That shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, night, oh
Shine into the night, night, night, ooh
