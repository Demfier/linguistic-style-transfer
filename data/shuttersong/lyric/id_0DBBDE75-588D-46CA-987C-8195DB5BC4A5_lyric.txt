Heartbeat so cold that I don't feel at all
Scarred up inside so I build all these walls
Head rolling back, but I'm faking the rush
I'm out every night and I'm lonely as fuck

I make my own rules, and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way, that's my way
And then I saw you in the dream right
I wanna call you, a kind of feeling
I can't name, I can't name

It's strange, but I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like
I've been chased; maybe I just knew I had to wait for you
Draw a knife and carve a little space for you
It feels nice

It's strange, but I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like

Open me up, I let down my defense
I swore that I wouldn't go falling again
I could be faded with somebody new
Rather be sober at home just us two.

I make my own rules, and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way, that's my way
And then I saw you in the dream right
I wanna call you, a kind of feeling
I can't name, I can't name

It's strange, but I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like
I've been chased, maybe I just knew I had to wait for you
Draw a knife and carve a little space for you
It feels nice
I make my rules, and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way, that's my way
And then I saw you in the dream right
I wanna call you, a kind of feeling
I can't name, I can't name
