The gates of heaven were locked shut
The pits of hell they were all filled up
And I fear I don't belong here
Yeah
They might call me a sinner
A walking flame from the fire that burns
Disappear, you don't belong here
Yeah

The church of fear
The church of failure
The church of fools
So call me a nothing
Call me a something
Treat me cruel

Hey!
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here, we don't belong
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here
It's the anthem of the underground
So get back up when they push you down
We're singing
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here, we don't belong
(We don't belong, we don't belong, we don't belong)

Can you hear the march of the rejects
Line up a parade of the defects
Can I hear we don't belong here

So rise from the darkness
Eyes of the dismissed
Hearts of the used
Show me your worst
Show me your cursed
Tell me the truth

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here, we don't belong
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here
It's the anthem of the underground
So get back up when they push you down
We're singing
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here, we don't belong

(Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh)
The gates of heaven were locked shut
The pits of hell they were all filled up
And I fear I don't belong here
(Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh)

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here, we don't belong
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here
It's the anthem of the underground
So get back up when they push you down
We're singing
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
We don't belong here, we don't belong
When you're alone
We don't belong
I don't belong
