All it takes is some moonlight and as long as the weathers fair
Reacts through a river, Romance by the evening air
A fragrance on the flesh this is who she is don't apologize
You are to awe her but you'll only be beautiful in the beholder's eye

Wonderful Wildflower
Open up let me see
Sexy hints in seasons,
Share your sunshine with me

The picture is perfect, a keepsake cause the occasion's rare
It's a portrait of motion, I'm just proud to say I was there
To pull her out of the ground,
standing out in the crowd, Oh my how she's grown
Hold her in both my hands and put her right on the
table when I get her home

Wonderful Wildflower
Open up let me see
Sexy hints in seasons,
Share your sunshine with me

Show those pretty colors baby,
Show them all to everyone, everybody's got a little light under the sun

Wonderful Wildflower
Open up let me see
Sexy hints in seasons,
Share your sunshine with me

Wonderful Wildflower
Open up let me see
Sexy hints in seasons,
Share your sunshine with me
