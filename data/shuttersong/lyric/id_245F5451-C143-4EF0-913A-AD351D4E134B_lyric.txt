Don't worry, about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singin', don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright

Rise up this mornin', smiled at the rising sun
Three little birds pitched by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Singing, this is my message to you

Singin' don't worry (no no no) 'bout a thing ('bout a thing)
'Cause every little thing (oh) is gonna be alright (is gonna be alright)
Singin' don't worry (don't you worry) about a thing (baby, don't you worry 'bout a thing)
'Cause every little thing, is gonna be alright (yes it is)

Rise up this mornin', smiled to the rising sun
Three little birds pitched by my doorstep

Singing, this is my message to you (so, pretty baby, let me tell you)
