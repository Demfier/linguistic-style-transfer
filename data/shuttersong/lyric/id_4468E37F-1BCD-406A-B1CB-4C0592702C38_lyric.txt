I've been out on the ocean
Sailing alone, traveling nowhere
and you've been running on hard ground
With just you around
Your heartbeat's the only sound

But I know, once in a while we will find
The sound of your heart beats with mine
And when it's time
I'll leave the ocean behind

So I'll look out for a lighthouse
See through the fog, Search the horizon
You'll be like in a movie
Where everything stops; You can see clearly now

But I know, once in a while we will find
The sound of your heart beats with mine
And when it's time
I'll leave the ocean behind
Ooooooooohhh
I'll leave the ocean behind
Oooooooohhh

'Cause I know, once in a while we will find
The sound of your heart beats with mine
And someday, the crash of the waves will be far away
And I will sail in your eyes
'Cause when it's time
I'll leave the ocean behind
