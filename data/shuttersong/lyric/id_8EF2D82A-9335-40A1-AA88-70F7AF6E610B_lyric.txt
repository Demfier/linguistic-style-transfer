All the mornings and late nights
You know I still treat you right
Long days and I'm hard at work
But you know I put you first
Hold your body close to me
Don't worry no one can see
Don't worry no one can see
Your head on my pillow next to mine
There's never enough time
To let you know that I'm all yours, forever

Here, when you call my name I'm on your
I can make it all alright
Even when I know when you go
I'll get you anytime you like,
I, I, I, I'm taking you to my life
I, I, I give all I
Not a secret, they all know
My love for you I'll show
And I don't care what they have to say
In my arms you will remain
In my arms you will remain

Here, when you call my name I'm on your
I can make it all alright
Even when I know when you go
I'll get you anytime you like,
I, I, I, I'm taking you to my life
I, I, I give all I
I knew it was true, knew what I had to do
You were the one, nothing else could be done
I knew it was true, knew what I had to do
You were the one, nothing else could be done

Here, when you call my name I'm on your
I can make it all alright
Even when I know when you go
I'll get you anytime you like,
I, I, I, I'm taking you to my life
I, I, I give all I.
Here, when you call my name I'm on your
I can make it all alright
Even when I know when you go
I'll get you anytime you like,
I, I, I, I'm taking you to my life
I, I, I give all I.
