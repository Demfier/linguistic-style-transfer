So what it is girl, what's good,
Why you so dangerous with those looks,
And you can hit me on the phone when you're home alone,
Tell me when to go, I'll be on the road, 
Tryna get next to you, 
You're uncomfortable,
Puzzle pieces don't fit better than we do,
I bet the tick-tock on the clock stops when the beat drops,
Uh, I put that on citas
Tick-tock on the clock stops when the beat drops,
C'mon, I put that on citas
