In our home all day I waited for the change
Something warm that I could say
But I admit it won't come
Somehow I don't care
Though I love the clothes she wears
And I love her body bare (bare)

So, I pray, I pray that it wont feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling, yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart.

Here I pass the day in a most peculiar way
Watching ships out in the bay
and I swallow so hard
Am I too weak to fight?
As the day becomes the night
and I don't want to be right (right)

So, I pray, I pray that it wont feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling, yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart.

Don't better
Oooh
Better
Out of this
And I will tell you let it go
Oooh
Oooh
