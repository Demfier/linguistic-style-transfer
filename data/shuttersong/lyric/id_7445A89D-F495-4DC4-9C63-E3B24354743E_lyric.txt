We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover when under sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That's where we run
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
Anybody's got the power
They don't see it
They don't understand
Spin around and run for hours
You and me we got the world in our hands
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
Always we looking for the loving the little light
Loving the little light
We could be
Always we looking for the loving the little light
Loving the little light
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
