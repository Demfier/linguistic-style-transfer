One apple, one palm fruit, 30 pounds stewed dog root
three children play loudly along a sound valley
want you to be mine, knowing it's not fine, no it's not right, now is not the time
one thing my eyes say when they gaze, they gaze upon your gaze upon your light
let it be right...
let it be right...
let it be right...
let it be right...

all around me people seem so, they seem so happy
how can they be happy, when they know you aren't with me
if you the only see the way I see, the way I dance when i'm alone
you would marry me certainly nowthere's no doubting no no

with all the troubles this world has going
take me in your row boat till the sun's not glowing
when the world aint turning
I can be your sweet delight.
