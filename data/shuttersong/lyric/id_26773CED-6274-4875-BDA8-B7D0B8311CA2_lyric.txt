Everybody listen all over the world
I got a story 'bout my favorite girl
(Wait a minute)
Oh, my baby sexy for sure
I had to have him when he walked through the door
(Wait a minute)

She was 'bout to drive me insane
She come with drama while I'm giving her chains
(Wait a minute)
I'm focused but I'm losing control
He only wants me for my body zone
(Wait a minute)

Girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
(Wait a minute)
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking you get it just like that
(Wait a minute)

Minding my business, I was doing my things
Got my attention, so I gave him a chance
(Wait a minute)
Did I mention he was buying a bar? Yes he did
Gave him my number, he was trying so hard
(Wait a minute)

Bought me some things I didn't want, didn't need
Dropped down his jeans like I'm supposed to drop to my knees
(Wait a minute)
I been blowing up my phone like he know me
Been leaving messages, \
