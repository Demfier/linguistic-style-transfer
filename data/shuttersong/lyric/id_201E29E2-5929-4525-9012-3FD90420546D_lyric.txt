Imma get you niggas something
Started from the bottom, I came from nothing
Anybody in my way Imma punch them
You can all lick my balls, I'm gone, bitch
You best get lost or get tossed to the sharks, bitch
If that ain't raw, fuck it all, I'm garbage
At least I made enough to move out my mom's crib
And I made it out the game with a bomb, bitch
I wish she mention this when I got my palms read
She didn't mention this that I leave you all dead
She didn't say that I put you in your bed
That the game is mine and my sound is timeless
The god of music said, I'm one of a kind, yeah

There's nothing now that can get me down
You hear me now
Life just took me for a spin around
I get it now
There's nothing now that can get me down
You hear me now
Life just took me for a spin around
I get it now
Bitch, nothing now that can get me down

Life just took me for a spin around
I get it now

I'm talking ex-girls took my bed bills
Took my old friends, nigga, shit is real
Tryna find a home, tryna cook a meal
Sleeping in my whip, do you got the wheel?
I don't want to be a failure
I just want to be the man, yeah
God, do you hear my prayers?
If you hear me, can you say something?
I want a new life, shit, to live it twice
Sold my body cause the bones look nice
Why you do shit when it don't look right?
All I know is blow like dynamite
I know one thing is I won't die tonight
I'm super thankful that I got a life
Prehistoric to the bone, nigga
I have come to kill you clones, nigga
Knock you right up off the throne, nigga
Since you want to act chrome, nigga
Imma aim for your dome, nigga
Pull a trigger on a hoe nigga
Reverse it all and you gon' die tonight
You need happiness to live this life
Oh, you need happiness to live this life
You need happiness to live this life
