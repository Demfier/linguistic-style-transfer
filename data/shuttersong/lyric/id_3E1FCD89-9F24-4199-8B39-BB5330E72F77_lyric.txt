Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields where we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle, Jingle ...
