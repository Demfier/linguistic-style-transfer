Happy Xmas (War Is Over) - The Moody Blues
So this is Christmas
And what have you done 
Another year over
A new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young
Very  merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is Christmas
The weak and the strong
The rich and the poor ones
The road is so long
And so happy Christmas
For black and for white
The yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight
A very  merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
