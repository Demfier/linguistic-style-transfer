I should've known when I got you alone
That you were way too into me to know
This isn't love boy, this ain't even close
But you always think we're something that we're not
And now you call me every single night
I only answer 'cause I'm too polite
We happened once or maybe it was twice
Yeah you always make it hard for me to stop
But you always think we're something that we're not (Hey)

You wanna be more than just friends

I can't go through this again
Stop trying get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook up
It's getting stupid
'Cause I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, Hey!
I hear you're telling every one you know (Hey)

That I'm the one like you can't let me go (Hey)

And you just keep on blowing up my phone
'Cause you never seem to knowing you should stop
Don't introduce me any of your friends (Hey)
Delete my number, don't call me again (Hey)
We had some fun but now it's gonna end
But you always make it hard for me to stop
Now you always think we're something that we're not, Hey!
You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again

Stop trying get inside my head

Don't wanna do more than up
It's getting stupid
'Cause I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, Hey!
Something that we're not, Hey!
You think we're something that we're not
Yeah, you think we're something that we're

Not gonna happen dude

Oh, You wanna be more than just friends
I can't go through this again
Stop trying get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than up
It's getting stupid
'Cause I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, Hey
Something that we're not
You think we're something that we're not
Something that we're not
Something
You think we're something that we're not
Yeah, you think we're something we're not
