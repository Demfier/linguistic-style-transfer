 Even when it hurts like hell, ill praise you 
 Even  when  it makes no sense to sing, louder then ill sing your praise 
ill only sing your praise x3 
and my heart burns only for you 
you wont, you wont let go 
and my soul waits only for you 
I will sing, till the morning has come 
and my heart burns only for you 
you wont, you wont let go 
and my soul waits only for you
I will sing, till the miracle comes
i will only sing your praise x3
 Even  when the morning comes, ill praise you 
 Even  when the fight is won, ill praise you
 Even  when my time on earth is done, louder then ill sing your praise 
i will only sing your praise
