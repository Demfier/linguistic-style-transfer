You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's makin' a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you are sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness' sake

Oh, you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town, to town

He's makin' a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you are sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness' sake

Oh, you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
