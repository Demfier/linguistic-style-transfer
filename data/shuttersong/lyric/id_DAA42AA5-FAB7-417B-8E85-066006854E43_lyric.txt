Wait, I think we're on to something that we can't run from
Fate, but we can let it take us down
Down this road, where all our colours run together
Let's take the worst and make it better
Let's take this mess and make a home

I know it gets hard for you to stay
But do you really wanna throw it all away?
(I'm thinking)

We could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moments
Watching the roads turning into white roses

We don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
The girl with the cinderblock garden
Tonight, take all the ghosts and all those skeletons
You hide, (you hide) bury them deep beneath the ground
Let them rest, (let them rest) because you weren't meant to bear that burden
Look at the roses in your garden
You can breathe now and forget

Forget it gets hard for you to stay
But we don't really have to throw it all away
I'm thinking

We could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moments
Watching the roads turning in to white roses

(Roses)

We don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

Just hold out for tomorrow
Our dreams will follow
Follow us back
(To when)

When nothing was broken
The future was open
Let's go back again
(Let's go again)

We could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moments
Watching the roads turning in to white roses
(Roses)
We don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
The girl with the cinderblock garden
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
The girl with the cinderblock garden
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
The girl with the cinderblock garden
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
Oh Oh O-O-Oh
The girl with the cinderblock garden
