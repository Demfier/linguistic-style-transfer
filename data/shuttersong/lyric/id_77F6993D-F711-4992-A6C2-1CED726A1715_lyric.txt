Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
My my-y my my-y oh give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
My my-y my my-y give me love
