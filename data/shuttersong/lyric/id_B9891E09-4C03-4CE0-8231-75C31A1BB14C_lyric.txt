They closed the parkway late last night
And as I sat with the echoes of lies that I told
I felt young, never changed by crooked hearts
So put the shotgun back in the glove
Come on and wait another year for
that dream far away
To come home, to be brave

Everything has changed
and now it's only you that matters
I will find anyway to your wild heart

They boarded up the windows
and the doors to my house
No one will ever read the letters
or the lies that I told
From the years I was changed
by crooked hearts
Why did they have to go and do us like that
Why did they have to go and run from the
dream far away

Were we there? Was I brave?

To think everything must die
for anyone to matter
Got to find anyway to your wild heart

Everything has changed and
now I can't tell what matters
I will find any way to your wild heart
