I'm gonna face you tonight
And I will thank you for your time
Collecting each word you say
And I will turn them in to rhymes

I keep moving on one down
Look at me, stop turn around
Who will talk and who will do
Anything is up to you
You are getting close to me

I will show you, wait and see
I'm only here for a moment
His love is safe and it won't die
I'm only here for a moment
Keep it up, get to try

You're not a stranger to me
But you're the strangest in the room
Can be myself around you
Oh I can be a wild balloon

I keep moving on one down
Look at me, stop turn around
Who will talk and who will do
Anything is up to you
You are getting close to me

I will show you, wait and see
I'm only here for a moment
His love is safe and it won't die
I'm only here for a moment
Keep it up, get to try
