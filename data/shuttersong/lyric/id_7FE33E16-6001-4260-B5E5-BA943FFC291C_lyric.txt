Desperado
Sitting in a old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow uh
Take it easy
I'm not tryna go against you
Actually, I'm going with you

Gotta get up out of here and you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't, 'cause we share common interests you
Need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never know, no, just want out of here, yeah
Once I'm gone, ain't no going back

If you want
Take a peek and run away, running from
Any site of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing here for me
There ain't nothing here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

(Oh, oh, oh)

Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broken
Take it easy
I'm not trying to go against you
I can be a lone wolf with ya

Gotta get up out of here and you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't, 'cause we share common interests you
Need me, there ain't no leaving me behind

I don't wanna be alone
