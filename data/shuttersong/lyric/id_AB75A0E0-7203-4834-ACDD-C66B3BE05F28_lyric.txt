Got from all the wallets, going down no doubt
Got girls to my left, drinks to my right

(Whatever) Whatever you need is on the dancefloor
Can't wait every morn, because it don't last forever
No-oh

Go jump to the spotlight, and tear it up like we got one night
Cause tomorrow morning, we'll be leaving
So right now you better jump, ride it
Tomorrow morning, we'll be leaving

So let's keep it rocking till daylight
Gotta live like we got one night, one night, one night
Gotta live like we got one night, one night, one night
Cause you know we just got one life, one life, one life

Gotta live like we got one night, one night, one night

Gonna have you screaming out, gonna make you say, ooh, ooh, ooh
