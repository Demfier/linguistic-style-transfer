Flashlight (feat  DJ Fresh) - Ellie Goulding
Do you remember boy when you were so cruel 
When you played the thief and I played the fool 
Gonna make you move 
Make you move  make you move
Spent so long crying over you 
Now I'm coming your way
Gonna make you move
Gonna make you move 
Make you move  make you move
Tracing faces in the sand
Now your dagger is in my hand
I'll make you move  I'll make you move 
I'll make you move
I'll make you run faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
Cause I can't lose 
I'll make you run faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
I'm coming through 
I'll make you run
I'll make you run ¨C ah
I'll make you run ¨C oh 
I'll make you run ¨C ah
Coming down on you with a flashing light 
There's nowhere to run
Baby you can't hide
Gonna make you move  make you move 
Make you move
It's too late now the table's turned 
There's no going back and you'll never learn
Unless I make you move
I'll make you move  I'll make you move 
And you think I'm still broken hearted 
But you'll never win the war you started
You'll never open your eyes
I'll make you run faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
Cause I can't lose 
I'll make you run faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
I'm coming through 
And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you will never win the war you started 
You'll never open your eyes
I'll make you run  I'll make you run 
I'll make you run  I'll make you run 
I'll make you run  I'll make you run
Faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
Cause I can't lose 
I'll make you run faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
I'm coming through 
I'll make you run faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
Cause I can't lose 
I'll make you run faster  faster  faster  flashlight
Flashlight  get outta my way  get outta my way
I'm coming through 
Get outta my way  get outta my way 
I'm coming through
