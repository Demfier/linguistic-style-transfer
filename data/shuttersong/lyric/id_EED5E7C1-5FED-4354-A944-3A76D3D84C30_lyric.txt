Hold me
like the river Jordan,
and I will then say to thee
you are my friend

Carry me
like you are my brother,
love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary
Tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?

When lost will you find me?
But they told me
a man should be faithful,
and walk when not able,
and fight till the end,

but I'm only human!

Everyone taking control of me,
seems that the world's
got a role for me
I'm so confused
will you show to me,

you be there for me,
and care enough to bear me!
(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)

(Softly then boldly) (Yeah!)
(Carry me there) (I'm only human!)
(Feed me) (Hold me!)
(Love me and feed me)

(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed) (I'm only human!)
(Carry)
(Carry me boldly)

(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me there) (I'm only human!)
(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me)

(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)
(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
(Show me you care)
(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)
(Need me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)
