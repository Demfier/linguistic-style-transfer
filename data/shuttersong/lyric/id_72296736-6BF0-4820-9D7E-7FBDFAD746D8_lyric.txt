Hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm

I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded?

Oh no no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

Hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
Well tell me when it kicks in
Hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a brokenhearted lover

Oh no no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

Hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
Well tell me when it kicks in
Hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind, calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind, calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind, calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind, calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind, calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind, calling out across the line

Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
