Style - Taylor Swift\n Midnight\n You come and pick me up no headlights\n A long drive\n Could end in burning flames or paradise\n Fade into view oh it's been a while since I have even\n Heard from you heard from you\n I should just tell you to leave 'cause I\n Know exactly where it leads but I\n Watch us go 'round and 'round each time\n You got that james dean daydream look in your eye\n And I got that red lip classic thing that you like\n And when we go crashing down we come back every time\n 'Cause we never go out of style\n We never go out of style\n You got that long hair slicked back white t-shirt\n And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt\n And when we go crashing down we come back every time\n 'Cause we never go out of style\n We never go out of style\n So it goes\n He can't keep his wild eyes on the road\n Takes me home\n Lights are off he's taking off his coat\n I say I heard oh that you've been out and about\n With some other girl some other girl\n He says what you've heard is true but I\n Can't stop thinking about you and I\n I said I've been there too a few times\n 'Cause you got that james dean daydream look in your eye\n And I got that red lip classic thing that you like\n And when we go crashing down we come back every time\n 'Cause we never go out of style\n We never go out of style\n You got that long hair slicked back white t-shirt\n And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt\n And when we go crashing down we come back every time\n 'Cause we never go out of style\n We never go out of style\n Take me home\n Just take me home yeah\n Just take me home\n Out of style\n You got that james dean daydream look in your eye\n And I got that red lip classic thing that you like\n And when we go crashing down we come back every time\n 'Cause we never go out of style\n We never go out of style
