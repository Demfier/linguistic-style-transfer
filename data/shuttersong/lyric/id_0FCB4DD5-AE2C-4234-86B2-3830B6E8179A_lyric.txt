You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
But you don't really give a shit
You don't let it go, let it go with it
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock'n'roll

You said hey what's your name
It took one look & now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said hey & since that day
You stole my heart & you're the one to blame

And that's why I smile, it's been a while
Since every day & everything has felt this right
And now you turn it all around & suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I...
I smile...

Last night I blacked out I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember making out & then
I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me & my name was on you
I will do it all over again

You said hey what's your name
It took one look & now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said hey & since that day

And that's why I smile, it's been a while
Since every day & everything has felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I...
I smile...
The reason why I...
I smile...
