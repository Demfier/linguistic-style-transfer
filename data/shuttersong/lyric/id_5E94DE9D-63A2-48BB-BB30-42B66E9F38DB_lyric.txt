There are days when I wake up
That I don't know what I'm doing here
I barely recognize the pair of eyes staring back at me in the mirror
there was a day that I was free
Not a care that I could see
So good I barely could believe that it was happening
Oh take me back again

I was 16 with an open heart
windows down in a beat up car
When I was dumb and the world was young and she was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful

How do we end up like this?
Living lives that we don't care about?
Too busy fixing things
On computer screens
While the grass grows green
Me, I'm screaming out

There was a day that I was free
Not a care that I could see
So good I barely could believe that it was happening
Oh take me back again

I was 16 with an open heart
windows down in a beat up car
When I was dumb and the world was young and she was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah

There was a day that I was free
Not a care that I could see
So good I barely could believe that it was happening
Oh take me back again

I was 16 with an open heart
windows down in a beat up car
When I was dumb and the world was young and she was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful
It was you, it was you, and you are beautiful, yeah
I was 16 with an open heart
windows down in a beat up car
When I was dumb and the world was young and she was beautiful
Ohhh
