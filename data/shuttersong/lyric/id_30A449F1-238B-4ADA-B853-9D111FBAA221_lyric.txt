Listen to me

There's only one thing you cannot see
Every time you talk.

Millions of things
There's only one that you cannot see
Every time you talk.

You can stop the clocks forever

Listen to what I say
Stop the clocks for you and me.

Listen to me again
Stop the clocks forever.

Listen to me
There's only one thing you cannot see
Every time you talk.

Millions of things
There's only one that changes everything.
Every time you talk.

You cannot stop the clocks forever.

Listen to what I say
stop the clocks for you and me.

Listen to me again
stop the clocks forever
stop the clocks forever.
Everything happens too fast
now it's a part of my past
everything changes so fast.
Stop the clocks forever
stop the clocks for you and me
stop the clocks forever
stop the clocks...
