Lost in the day  in a way\n It's the same a the one before this\n And I wish I could say\n That's it's all black and white\n But it's grey  it's the same\n It's the same and I'm so tired\n But you are what I'm coming home to\n Oh and I'm thinking abouta a red wine buzz and takin' it easy\n And I got you in my arms  takin' a break from crazy\n And I'll say hey  you'll say baby  how's ur day\n I'll say crazy  but it's all gonna be alright\n You'll kiss my smile  I'll pull you closer  spend a while\n Just getting to know ya  but it's gonna be all alright\n I'm loving you tonight  loving you tonight\n And you are there on my heart  at the start\n Of my every morning and I can't deny\n By the end of the day that I'm running on empty\n But you make me full  steal my breath\n You're so unpredictable  that's what I'm coming home to\n Oh I'm dreaming about a romance  slow dancing with you\n When I got you in arms  I don't care what we do\n And I'll say hey  you'll say baby  how's ur day\n I'll say crazy  but it's all gonna be alright\n You'll kiss my smile  I'll pull you closer  spend a while\n Just getting to know ya  but it's gonna be  alright\n I'm loving you tonight\n Every day is just the in-between\n The hours separating you from me\n I know you'll be waiting  I know you'll be waiting\n And I'll say hey  you'll say baby  how's ur day\n I'll say crazy  but it's all gonna be alright\n You'll kiss my smile  I'll pull you closer  spend a while\n Just getting to know ya  but it's gonna be alright\n I'm loving you tonight  loving you tonight
