Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't WALK man I get caught down
And I'll be falling all the way down

Hundred headlights, making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once then I never think twice
But your temptations making me stay another night
And my sense only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how I feel so raw to me, raw to me
I gotta check myself, before I get what I want
Find out it's not what I thought it was

And you know I gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't WALK then I get caught down
And all before and all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Because if I don't WALK I can¡¯t even sit around
And I'll be falling all the way down

Tell myself leave, while I'm still strong
Going on back till I'm 10 miles gone
And when the road stops I'm gonna keep going
Until I end up in the place that I belong
But the question's pushing me back again
Feeling enough with the ten
There's even use even trying to get you out my head
So I lift my feet off the ground 
And I'm gonna walk right up

Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't WALK man I get caught down
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Because if I don't WALK I can¡¯t even sit around
And I'll be falling all the way down

(x2)
Won't get caught in the offside trap
Run away, run away, never come back
No way I'm going down like that
No, no, run away, run away

Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't WALK man I get caught down
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Because if I don't WALK I can¡¯t even sit around
And I'll be falling all the way down
I'm gonna walk now, 
I'm gonna walk now, yeah
Better walk
