You were dancing in your tube socks, in our hotel room
Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over
Rest your head upon my shoulder
Just wanna feel your lips against my skin

White sheets, bright lights
Crooked teeth in the night life
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy, underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn't let you complete me

I'm trying not to let it show
That I don't wanna let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?

Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
and you clutched my brain and eased my ailings

You're writing lines 'bout me, romantic poetry
Your girl has got red in her cheeks
Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain, but you're stuck in my brain
And all I do is cry and complain
Bcause seconds aren't the same

I'm sorry, but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're lookin' like you fell in love tonight
Can we pretend that we're in love?

I'm sorry, but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're lookin' like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?
