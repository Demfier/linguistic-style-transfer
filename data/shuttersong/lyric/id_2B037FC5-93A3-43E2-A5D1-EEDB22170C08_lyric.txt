The summer sun
Running on the beach
For all the times we had together

There is still faith
Fading away
You said our love was forever

Tears in the rain
Nothing's the same
I'm far from love

Hurt by your flame
Until we meet again
I'm far, so far from love.

The autumn leaves
Falling from the sky
Its turning cold
The summer's fading

You're by my side
We'll meet again
I know this love is forever

Forever and ever...

Tears in the rain
Nothing's the same
I'm far from love

Hurt by your flame
Until we meet again
I'm far, so far from love.
