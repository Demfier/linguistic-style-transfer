Call back the CAPCOM
Tick off the time bomb
Let felicity fly!
(Felicity fly)

Armor the air lock
Blanket the bed rock
And kiss the planet goodbye!
(Planet goodbye)

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark.
(Dark, dark)
But, dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far.

(Da da-da da-da da-da da-da)
(Da da-da da da da daaaah)
Through the galaxies
(Da da-da da-da da-da da-da)
(Da da-da da da da daaaah)
(Da da-da dah)

Fight back the flight deck
Bring on the break neck
Cue the solar eclipse!
(Sun went dark)
Summit the sunset
Dubtail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits.
(Through the galaxies)

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark.
(Sun went dark)
But, dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far.

Oh telescope
Keep an eye on my only hope
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need.
For He is the saving grace of the galaxies!
(Galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, galaxies)
He is the saving grace of the galaxies.
(Galaxies)

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
(Sun went dark)
But, dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far!
(This far)
(I would follow this far)
