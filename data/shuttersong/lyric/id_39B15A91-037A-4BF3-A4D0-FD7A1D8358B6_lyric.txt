She's had a face straight out a magazine
God only knows but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
When she gets his gun he's begging, babe stay stay

I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Will I know?

Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow
You've got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home
She's begging you to stay stay stay stay stay

I'll give you want more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
There'll be a riot, â€˜cause I know you

Well now that you've got your gun
It's much harder now the police have come
Now shoot him if it's what you ask
But if you just take off your mask
You'd find out, everything's gone wrong

Now everybody's dead
And they're driving past my old school
And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
She says: babe, you look so cool

You look so cool, you look so cool, cool, cool, cool
You look so cool, you look so cool, you look so cool, cool, cool, cool, cool
