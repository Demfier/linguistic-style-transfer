This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know

You know, you know
I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore
On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us

Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know
You know, you know
I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you

Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long

So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know
I wanted

I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
I love you (I love you)
I've loved you all along
I forgive you (I forgive you)
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing hold on to me and never let me go
