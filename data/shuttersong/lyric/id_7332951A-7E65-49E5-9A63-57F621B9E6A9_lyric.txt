She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Ow Sweet child o mine
Ow Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me
Of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Ow Sweet child o mine
Ow Sweet love of mine
Ow Sweet child o mine
Ow Sweet love of mine
Ow Sweet child o mine
Ow Sweet love of mine
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Ow Where do we go now
I
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Now
Sweet child
Sweet child o mine
