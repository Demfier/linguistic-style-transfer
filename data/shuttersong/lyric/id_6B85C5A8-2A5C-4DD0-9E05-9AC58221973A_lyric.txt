I can't hold it down
Or hold it in
Cause I got a feeling
That I've finally found.
I've waited on you all my life
And with no rhyme or reason
I got knocked to the ground.

I'm in a thousand pieces and I've got no excuse
To keep this all a secret, secret, now.

I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
I'm gonna be there till my heart stops beating
My heart stops beating
And now it don't matter where you are
I'm never gonna be that far
I'm gonna be there till my heart stops beating
My heart stops beating

While your eyes deny everything to me
But they reflect just like a diamond ring, I see it, oh
And when we're together
We're together now
So confess that this is more than we know
A situation that if we let go
Gonna end up regretting forever
And ever now.

Well, I'm in a thousand pieces and I've got no excuse
To keep this all a secret, secret, now.

I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
I'm gonna be there till my heart stops beating
My heart stops beating
And now it don't matter where you are
I'm never gonna be that far
I'm gonna be there till my heart stops beating
My heart stops beating

Ooooooooooooooooooooh I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
I'm gonna be there till my heart stops beating
My heart stops beating And now it don't matter where you are
I'm never gonna be that far
I'm gonna be there till my heart stops beating
My heart stops beating My heart stops beating
