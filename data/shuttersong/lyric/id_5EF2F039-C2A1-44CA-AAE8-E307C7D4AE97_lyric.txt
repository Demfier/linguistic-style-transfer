You said it's ok
I said I'm happy
Come love me like you love me?
Just one more time

My heart's a jungle
I escape into the city lights
Dive into the colors
And it's alright, it's alright

And I could set the world on fire
Just to see you come undone
I'm fallin' but it feels like flying
Into the daylight, into the daylight

And I could set the world on fire
Just to see you come undone
We're never high enough, come higher
Into the daylight

The heart get no sleep
The heart get no sleep
The heart get no sleep

I trip in phantasy
We're burning diamonds
Feel so united
You hurt like love

We keep our secrets
I shoot rockets through the silence
Touch me like a ritual
Just take it all - Come take it all

And I could set the world on fire
Just to see you come undone
I'm fallin' but it feels like flying
Into the daylight

The heart get no sleep
The heart get no sleep
The heart get no sleep

The heart get no sleep
Love me, come love me
The heart get no sleep
Love me like we've never been hurt

Like we've never been hurt
The heart get no sleep
The heart get no sleep
The heart get no sleep
