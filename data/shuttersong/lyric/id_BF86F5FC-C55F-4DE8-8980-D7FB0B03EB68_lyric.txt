Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just human
These nights never seem to go to planned
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

Oh won't you stay with me
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self control
Deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh won't you stay with me
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Ohohohuh
Oh, won't you stay
Oh, won't you stay
Won't you stay with me
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Won't you
Stay
With me
