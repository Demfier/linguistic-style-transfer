When I was a young boy
My Father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said Son when you grow up will you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned
He said will you defeat them your demons and all the non-believers
The plans they have made
Because one day I leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
Through it all the rise and fall the bodies in the streets
When you're gone we want you all to know
We'll Carry on
We'll Carry on
Though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
Carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I cant contain it
The anthem wont explain it
And we will send you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Lets shout it loud and clear
Do you fight it to the end
We hear the call to
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
You're wiery widow marches
And on we carry through the fears
Ooh oh ohhhh
Dissappointed faces of your peers
Ooh oh ohhhh
Take a look at me cos i could not care at all
Do or die
You'll never make me
Cos the world will never take my heart
You can try you'll never break me
Want it all i'm gonna play this part
Wont explain or say i'm sorry
Im not ashamed i'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Lose it here because it's only
I'm just a man i'm not a hero
Just a boy whos meant to sing this song
Just a man i'm not a hero
I don't care
Carry on
We'll carry on
Though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
You're wiery widow marches
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
We'll carry
We'll carry on
