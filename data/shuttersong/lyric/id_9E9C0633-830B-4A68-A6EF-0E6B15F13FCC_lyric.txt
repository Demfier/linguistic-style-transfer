This Friday, in the underground
I'm in London, lost in the crowd
and I see you, yeah I see you
Styling with that confidence
when you're smiling
I don't stand a chance
I see you, yeah baby I see you
tell me
how would you feel if I ever come and talked to you
my mind is telling me something
it's telling me to make a move
I swear, don't usually do this
but something's coming over me
but I can't hide the way im feeling
you're wicked when you work it out
Oh, you wicked when you work it
Oh, you wicked when you work it out
not trying to get with you
just trying to figure you out now
Oh, you wicked when you work it
Oh, you wicked when you work it out
not trying to play your heart
just trying to figure you out now
I'm dying this kind of love
you're flying so high above
I need you, yeah I need you
So hazy, when you feel like this
So crazy, but you're worth the risk
I need you, yeah baby I need you
tell me
how would you feel if I ever come and talked to you
my mind is telling me something
it's telling me to make a move
I swear, don't usually do this
but something's coming over me
but I can't hide the way I'm feeling
you're wicked when you work it out
Oh, you wicked when you work it
Oh, you wicked when you work it out
not trying to get with you
just trying to figure you out now
Oh, you wicked when you work it
Oh, you wicked when you work it out
not trying to play your heart
just trying to figure you out now
I can't fight the way I'm feeling
want you every day
I can't fight the way I'm feeling
want you every way
Oh, you wicked when you work it
Oh, you wicked when you work it out
not trying to get with you
just trying to figure you out now
Oh, you wicked when you work it
Oh, you wicked when you work it out
not trying to play your heart
just trying to figure you out now
(so good, so high, so crazy)
(so good, so high, so crazy)
(so good, so high, so crazy)
(so good, so high, so crazy)
