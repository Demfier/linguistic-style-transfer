I used to have work clothes looking like I rolled in a dirt road
Boss was in jerk-mode now I got fans in the first row
Used to blaze two in a Prelude
With my eyes all glassy like a space-suit
Spittin gettin' pissy like a drug test
Sippin' on a blood red Bud Hev'
But I'm the best on the beats, it's destined to be, S to the P
O to the S to the E
Emceed got cash for my speech
Never went to sleep without grass on my cleats
I been earning a permanent place and taking it passionately
But my biceps are looking like Avril Lavigne's
I rep for Maine rap I'm yet to change that
Sweat where my taint at, yep, the same cat
Jizzin' on her vertebrae the way I came back
if he ain't wack, he must have \
