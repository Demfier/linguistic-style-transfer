Oh I know you well
All your life I've watched you breathe
I've watched you lie across the seam through space and time
Through every year of every kind
I'd wait like snow, on the eve of spring
I can out last cold, can you out last me?
Every word you say, is a perfect thing
It's the perfect time, for the perfect love

And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire

Oh I've felt your spell
And all alike, it's been like hell
Every single time the cycle goes
In and out of mind, in and out of fear, of getting left behind
I see your glow, your eyes are kind, they kill as well
I bare in mind, every word I say is a silent thing
And a solid wish, will you lay with me?

And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire
And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, our clever love caught fire

And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire
And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, our clever love won't tire

And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, our clever love caught fire

You're all that I want, your that I need
You're my everything
You're all that I want, your that I need
You're my everything
