My life be like
Ooh ahh yea ooh oooh
its times like these that make me say
lord if you see me please come my way
leavin£§ bread crumbs for when i stray
rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
feel me like a fingertip
sometimes i fall i slip
my heartfelt desire be more like you
trying not to quench your fire by the things that i do
on an island by my lonesome stranded
low key and stayin£§ candid
reflect on all the things i try my hand at
search for the equations to persuasions im used to
finding comfort in the zones of closet bones i get loose to
a mountainous fontaine
spinnin and monsoonin
grinnin£§ its high octane
explosive how i came
rollin down hills cause lifes a hastle
enriched by my folly like a moat surround a castle
stay afloat catch a second wind
thin is theair i breathe
teary eyed nose runnin wipe the snot on my sleeve
im callin£§ on my savior to be all thathat i need
please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed
the fear of never falling in love
and the tears after losing the feelings
of what you thought love was
like the dirt still up under the rug
My life be like
bad characteristics
covered in christs blood
the joy of new birth
and the pain of growing up
the bliss between giving my all
the highs and lows
paths and roads i chose
in the cold i froze
trying to ease my woes
in thiis world of sin
clothes to thin to fend
so to god i send
words of help to win
in grumblings so deep
letters could never express
so the sound of ooh aah
beneath my breath projects
ooh aah ooh
come young diti
here comes that boy from the capital city
last up on the Grits new diti
but eight bars of the truth will do, eh
I believe there£§s a bride thats stunning
and, I believe in the kingdom coming
I believe if you seek the truth,
you don£§t need to look far cuz£§ it£§s gonna find you
but why oh why do I trip and stumble
and ohh ahh£§s can make me crumble
I can£§t believe that I£§m here again
again, again
It£§s times like these that make me say
leavin£§ bread crumbs for when I stray
rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
feel me like a fingertip
sometimes I fall I slip
my heartfelt desire be more like you
trying not to quench your fire by the things that I do
(again~)
fingertip..fingertip..fingertip..
