You sent a photo out your window of Tokyo.
Told me you were doing fine.
You said the cherry blossoms were blooming
and that I was on your mind.

but I couldn't make you out through the glitches.
It's how it always seems to go.
So we say our goodbyes over messenger
as the network overloads.

When the network overloads.

You're my wonder, little wanderer.
Off across the sea.
You're my wonder, little wanderer.
Won't you wander back to me?
Back to me.

Always falling asleep when you're waking
I count the hours on my hands.
Doing the math to the timezone you're at
was an unseen part of the plan.

But if you will be my bluebird returning
then I will be your evergreen.
Standing tall on your horizon
guiding you home to me
guiding you home to me.

You're my wonder, little wanderer.
Off across the sea.
You're my wonder, little wanderer.
Won't you wander back to me?
You're my wonder, little wanderer.
How I wish that you could see
little wanderer, little wanderer
how I need you back with me
back with me.

You sent a photo out your window of Paris
of what you wish that I could see.
But someone's gotta be the lighthouse
and that someone's gotta be me.
And I hope your absence makes us grow fonder.
I hope we always feel the same.
When our eyes meet past security
we embrace in the baggage claim
when we kiss in the baggage claim.

You're my wonder, little wanderer.
Off across the sea.
You're my wonder, little wanderer.
Won't you wander back to me?
You're my wonder, little wanderer.
How I wish that you could see
little wanderer, little wanderer
how I need you back with me
back with me.
