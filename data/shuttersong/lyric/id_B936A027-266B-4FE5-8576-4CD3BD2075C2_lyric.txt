Now that we¡¯ve come to an end
You say that you wanna be friends.

[Verse:]
Don¡¯t say a word, don¡¯t make a sound,
Don¡¯t keep in touch, don¡¯t come around,
Don¡¯t ask me how I¡¯m doing now,
Don¡¯t think of me, just fade me out.
Forget about me and I¡¯ll forget about you.

[Chorus:]
I can¡¯t pretend that I don¡¯t love you anymore
I can¡¯t be friends cause it hurts like it¡¯s never hurt before.
Now you think that I¡¯m cold and I don¡¯t care about you,
I¡¯m better without you, couldn¡¯t be further from the truth.
Girl, I¡¯m dying, I¡¯m just trying to survive you.

[Verse:]
My scars are still burning since you walked away,
Cause you rip them wide open when I see your face.
I¡¯m back at square one trying to breathe through the pain,
You don¡¯t even know what you¡¯re doing to me.
When I get through to life after you?

[Chorus:]
I can¡¯t pretend that I don¡¯t love you anymore
I can¡¯t be friends cause it hurts like it¡¯s never hurt before.
Now you think that I¡¯m cold and I don¡¯t care about you,
I¡¯m better without you, couldn¡¯t be further from the truth.
Girl, I¡¯m dying, I¡¯m just trying to survive you.

[Bridge:]
Now that we¡¯ve come to the end
You say that you wanna be friends.
But I,

[Chorus:]
I can¡¯t pretend that I don¡¯t love you anymore
I can¡¯t be friends cause it hurts like it¡¯s never hurt before.
Now you think that I¡¯m cold and I don¡¯t care about you,
I¡¯m better without you, couldn¡¯t be further from the truth.
Girl, I¡¯m dying, I¡¯m just trying to survive you,
I¡¯m just trying to survive you.
