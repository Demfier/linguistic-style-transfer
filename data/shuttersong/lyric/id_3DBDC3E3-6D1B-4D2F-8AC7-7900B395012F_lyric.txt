Ooooh Well,
You and I both know that the house is haunted.
Yeah, you and I both know that the ghost is of me.
Used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin' your chains.
Well back then, baby, it didn't seem so strange.

I used to bite. I used to moan.
But now there's nothin' left in show.
Well I ain't so scary on my own.
Tell me, honey, what's a dagger without a cloak.
Well I don't know.

'Cause,
You and I both know that the house is haunted.
Yeah, you and I both know that the ghost is of me.
Used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin' your chains.
Well back then, baby, it didn't seem so strange.

In the midnight hour, you came alive.
I was lookin' for my crystal ball.
I was busy tryin' to charm that snake.
Hsss-hsss.
When the sun came up, we had no place to hide.
And you had to tell your friends that my fangs were fake.
I just had to.
Oh.

Well,
You and I both know that the house is haunted.
Yeah, you and I both know that the ghost is of me.
Used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin' your chains.
Well back then, baby, it didn't seem so strange.

Well, even when one is dead and gone,
It still takes two to make a house a home.
Well, I'm as lonesome as the catacombs.
I hear you call my name, but no one's there,
Except a feelin' in the air.

'Cause,
You and I both know that the house is haunted.
Yeah, you and I both know that the ghost is of you.
Used to walk around screamin', or slammin' all them doors.
Well, I'm all grown up now. I don't scare easy no more,
But you and I both know.

Ooooh
Yeah, you and I both know.
Ooooh
Yeah, you and I both know.
Ooooh
