The birds have left the trees
The lights bores onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own

We got here the hard way
All those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get dark?

It's in my heart, it's in my head
I never take back the things I said
So high above
I feel it coming down
She said
In my heart and in my head

Tell me why this has to end
Oh no, Oh no...
I can't save us
My Atlantis

We fall
We've built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us
My Atlantis
Oh no
We've built it up to pull it down
Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known
It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you I would go

It's in my heart, it's in my head
You can't take back the things you said
So high above
I feel it coming down
She said
In my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh no, Oh no...
I can't save us
My Atlantis
we fall
We've built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us
My Atlantis
Oh no
We've built it up to pull it down
And we've built it up
And we've built it up
And we've built it up to pull it down

And we've built it up
And we've built it up
And we've built it up to pull it down

I can't save us
My Atlantis
We fall
We've built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us
My Atlantis
Oh no
We've built it up to pull it down
