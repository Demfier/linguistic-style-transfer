I found myself dreaming of
Silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
And you put me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
And I'm going to hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Where ever we're standing
I won't take you for granite
Cuz we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
So I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is never known
So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets
Lets take the time to say what we want
Here's what we got before its all gone
No we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
And I'm going to hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Where ever we're standing
I won't take you for granite
Cuz we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
So I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
And I'm going to hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Where ever we're standing
I won't take you for granite
Cuz we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
I'm going to love you
Like I'm going to lose you
