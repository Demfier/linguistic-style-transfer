How do we honor
Those who have fallen
And died for this dream
I'm sure of one thing
It's not with gridlock
Or bickering

We're the children of explorers
We came here from every corner
The adventurers that settled this land
Lead the world, fought tyranny
Touched the stars, brought liberty
Let's do that again

Tonight I dare you to dream
Go on believe impossible things
Whenever anybody says
There's anything we can't do
I mean after all
There's an American flag on the moon

Outside the other night
You should've seen the moonlight
It was enough to make you squint your eyes
So my five year old had learned about
The lunar landing and he walked out
And started staring at the sky

Stood there for a while
Got a great big smile and said "Dad I think I can see it, can you
I bowed my head
Closed my eyes and said
Yeah, son, I think I do"

Tonight I dare you to dream
Go on believe impossible things
Whenever anybody says
There's anything we can't do
'Cause after all
There's an American flag on the moon

Oh, in two hundred years
Think about all we've done so far
I don't see any reason why tomorrow can't be ours

Tonight I dare you to dream
Go on believe impossible things
Whenever anybody says
There's anything we can't do
'Cause after all, after all
There's an American flag on the moon
(On the moon)
