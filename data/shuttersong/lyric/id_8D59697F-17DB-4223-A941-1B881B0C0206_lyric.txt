His house party is crazy, my crew is hela wavy
Yo, flip the cut, then say whats up, then slide out with your lady
No ifs or buts about it, my style is technotronic
Got grips and models so spin the bottle, girl Im just getting started

Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the base
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get up!

We be raging round the clock, feel that base around the block
Fill that red cup to the top, birthday shots
Doesnt matter, who you are, look around, we in the stars
Round the world, we party all,
We go all night strong until we drop

Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the base
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get up!

Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Get up!

We aint going home, its 6 in the morn
This house is bumping, friction on
We aint going home, even when the lights come on
This house is bumping, base still go strong
Get up!
