I party like a rockstar, let the Benz fishtail

All out the window, I got it off a fish scale

Rollie with the big face, now I need the gold one

Timepiece piece crazy, girl, I got a cold one

When my car all cloudy let the A/C blast

I don't need love, baby, pay me cash

First of the month, when them fiends come I'm hot like a rock sale

Cocktails - red bean and oxtail

Three phones I'm trying to get a key sold

Weed smoke in the air, no diesel

We grow, shit you never seen, so

Rose Clicquot, the shit you gotta drink slow

All in my cup, bitch, I ain't on no fucked shit

I just want a pretty dime piece that'll suck dick

I just want a big fat crib and a race car

Thirty-five pounds by the window of my AR

I got a fresh new stash of endless cash

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I got two new whips and a brand new pad

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I just gotta slow down they say I move too fast

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I like lobster, crabs and poppin' tags

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

Berner, what up, nigga?

Wake up, grab some cake, hit it raw and bake up

Check my Twitter little niggas still follow what I say

Sayin' that they know that it's real so they put the fake up

Eight million Taylors later, niggas gon' hate us

I'm always rocking that joyrich

I pull up in a Porshe 911 you still drivin' that boy shit

Smellin' like the shit I just smoked

Jealous 'cause you livin' life broke

Mad 'cause my niggas all paid

Ridin' to some shit I just wrote

High like I was back in seventh grade

When my cousin first passed me that dope

Now I just pull up, valet

That's my man he know I got the hook up

Hoppin' out, #6 Jays, fly niggas look up

We the gang if you a hater go die with 'em

If you not come, get high with us

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I got two new whips and a brand new pad

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I just gotta slow down they say I move too fast

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I like lobster, crabs and poppin' tags

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I say hoe think twice

'Cause if you roll the joint for me, then it better be right, better be right

I say hoe think twice

If you roll the joint for me, then it better be right, better be right, be right, be right

If you roll the joint for me, then it better be right, better be right, be right, be right

If you roll the joint for me, then it better be right, better be right

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I got two new whips and a brand new pad

They try and tell me that this shit won't last

I just gotta slow down they say I move too fast
