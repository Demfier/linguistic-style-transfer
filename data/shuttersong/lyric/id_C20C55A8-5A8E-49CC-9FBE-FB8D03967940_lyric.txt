 I thought that you should know this.
 I'd sing your name over the airways
Crash your couch and sleep on the stairway.
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
 I'm hung up,  I'm shook up,
 I'm lovestruck.
 I'd wait all day, just for a maybe.
 I'm trying to find a way to be worthy.
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
 I'm hung up,  I'm shook up,
 I'm lovestruck.
 I'd lay flowers at your feet
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
 I'd be everything  you need.
Woah, oh, oh, oh
 You,  I'm lovestruck
 You,  I'm lovestruck
 I'm lovestruck
 I'd sing your name over the airways,
Crash your couch and sleep on the stairway.
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
 I'm hung up,  I'm shook up,
 I'm lovestruck.
 I'd wait all day, just for a maybe
 I'm trying to find a way to be worthy.
If not tonight, maybe tomorrow cause
 I'm hung up,  I'm shook up,
 I'm lovestruck.
 You,  I'm lovestruck
 You,  I'm lovestruck
 I'm lovestruck
 I'm lovestruck
