I've been searching a long time
For someone exactly like you
I've been traveling all around the world
Waiting for you to come through

Someone like you
Make it all worth while
Someone like you
Keeps me satisfied
Someone exactly like you

I've been traveling a hard road
Had been looking for someone exactly like you
I've been carrying my heavy load
Waiting for the light to come shining through

Someone like you
Make it all worth while
Someone like you
Make me satisfied
Someone exactly like you

I've been doing some soul searching
To find out where you're at
I've been up and down the highway
In all kinds of foreign land

Someone like you
Makin' all worth while
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you

I've been all around the world
Marching to the beat of a different drum
But just lately I have realized
Baby, the best is yet to come

Someone like you
Makin' all worth while
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you

Someone exactly like you
Someone exactly like you
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come

Someone exactly like you
