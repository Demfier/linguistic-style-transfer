I could have beer for breakfast
My sanity for lunch
Trying to get over how bad I want you so much
Innocence for dinner
Pour something in my cup

Anything and everything just to fill me up
But nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You go straight to my head
Now head straight for the edge

I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you
I can feel you whisper and laying on the floor
I try to stop but I keep on coming back for more
I'm a light-weight and I know it

Cause after the first time, I was falling, falling down
Nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You go straight to my eye
Now head straight for the edge

I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you

Bittersweet ecstasy, that you got me in
I can sleep tonight
And you made me feel like I'm out of my mind

But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
That you got me in
I can slip tonight
And you made me feel like I'm out of my mind
Oh but it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You go straight to my eye
Now head straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you
