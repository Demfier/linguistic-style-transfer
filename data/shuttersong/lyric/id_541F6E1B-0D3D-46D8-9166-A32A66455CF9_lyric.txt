Slow down, I want to watch you on your own now.

I've been keeping quiet for a while.
Now that you're fine.
Catch your breath before I get home in the morning.
You walk outside in a hurry.
Before I get home in the morning,
You'll walk outside tonight.

Drawn out, I was empty, you were alright.
I found all the pieces you left outside.
Now that you're fine,
Catch your breath before I get home in the morning.
You walk outside in a hurry.
Before I get home in the morning,
You'll walk outside tonight.
