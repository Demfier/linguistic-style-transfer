Ohh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah, standin' ovation
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry (please)
Just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone
(You better hurry up) Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talkin' 'bout \
