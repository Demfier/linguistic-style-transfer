We're the punk ass kids
That your mama warned you 'bout
We're the midnight lovers
Locking lips and sneaking out
And they'll try to drag us down
But we'll scream and shout
We're never growing up
We're never going down
Oh Oh

I've been losing my mind
Who cares I'll find it later
Just crashed my dad's new car
Our deal looks good on paper
I've been with you girl
But I'm not tryna' date her
Yeah I'm causing trouble
Up until the break of dawn

And I said HEY
We're the kings of the party
Turn around and grab somebody
Let's show 'em what we're all about
But HEY sorry not sorry
That's just something about me
We need to scream it loud right now!

We're the punk ass kids
That your momma warned you 'bout
We're the midnight lovers
Locking lips and sneaking out
And they'll try to drag us down
But we'll scream and shout
We're never growing up
We're never going down
Oh Oh

I've been around the world
I've seen a bunch of places
A lot of beautiful girls
One or two I've seen naked
And I'm not good at math
My mind's not calculated
Yeah I'm causing trouble
And I just don't care at all

And I said HEY
We're the kings of the party
Turn around and grab somebody
Let's show 'em what we're all about
But HEY sorry not sorry
That's just something about me
We need to scream it loud right now!

We're the punk ass kids
That your momma warned you 'bout
We're the midnight lovers
Locking lips and sneaking out
And they'll try to drag us down
But we'll scream and shout
We're never growing up
We're never going down
Oh Oh

Baggy pants Vans on
Snapback kickin back with my jams on
Baby won't you meet me out back after the last song
So I can take you to the villa
And get my hands on you
It's not much just a hump and dump
Cos I don't even want your number
I just want your love
Cos that pretty smile is a major hit with me
Just check my dollars
And you'll be all over me

We're the punk ass kids
That your momma warned you 'bout
We're the midnight lovers
Locking lips and sneaking out
And they'll try to drag us down
But we'll scream and shout
We're never growing up
We're never going down
Oh Oh
Never growing up (oh oh)
We're never going down (oh oh)
We're never growing up (growing up)
