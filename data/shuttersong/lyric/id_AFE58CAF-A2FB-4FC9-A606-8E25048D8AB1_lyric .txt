You, answer for you

And when I see you there, I know it's true

You, answer for you

I need to know if you can feel the same as I do

You are always thirsty for the lovin'

Making me feel like I'm not worth somethin'

While you playing this like I'm a fool

Knowing full well that I want you

Now that's just cruel

And you know it's true

We have been through too much for you to let go

To let go

Tell me how you feel and we can take it slow

Take it slow

Take it slow

Take it slow
