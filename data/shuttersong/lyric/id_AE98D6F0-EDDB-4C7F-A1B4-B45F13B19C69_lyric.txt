Oh the Green and Red of Mayo
I can see it still
It's soft and craggy boglands
It's tall majestic hills
Where the ocean kisses Ireland
And the waves carress it's shore
Oh the feelin' it came over me
To stay forever more
Forever more

From it's rollin' coastal waters
I can see Croagh Patrick's peak
Where one Sunday every Summer
The pilgrims climb the reek
Where Saint Patrick in it's solitude
Looked down across Clew Bay
And With the ringin' of his bell
Called the faithful there to pray
There to pray

Oh take me to Clare Island

The home of Granuaile
It's waters harbour fishes
From the herring to the whale
And now I must depart it
And reality is plain
May the time not pass so slowly
'Fore I set sail again
Set sail again
Oh the Green and Red of Mayo

I can see it still

It's soft and craggy boglands
It's tall majestic hills
Where the ocean kisses Ireland
And the waves carress it's shore
Oh the feelin' it came over me
To stay forever more
Forever more
Stay forever more
Oh the Green and Red of Mayo
Oh the Green and Red of Mayo
Oh the Green and Red of Mayo
Oh the Green and Red of Mayo
