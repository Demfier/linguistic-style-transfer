LA Girl - The Janoskians
I don't really care when you say that girls just want to have fun
Want to do her hair every single day 'til the end of the month
Hey look at this one  fine as hell but missed some
And if we get screws and pistons that's why I can never pick one
I know you called me 'cause you have no place to go
If you want me 'cause you're lonely I'll pretend you ain't a hoe
'Cause you fine  you know you're fine  that's why your mine just like a bowl
Of compliments and confidence  hey that's how it goes oh
Oh  you are just an LA girl  I will never fall for
Oh  spoiled little LA girl  I don't really need that
Oh  you are just an LA girl acting like you own the world
Stupid little LA girl  I don't really need that
Big butt and a face like Cali
Takes more than a pretty face to wow me
She can't go anywhere without me
She's an LA girl but she never been to Cali
I got a girl who fine as shit and I want all y'all to know
But the problem with this chick is that she coming at me cold
When we making our deposits into her apartment you know
That I'm an artist so why you think I got shit
You acting like you want me  you just want some clothes
Yeah I know I got a side piece you are just a bro  man
I call you 'cause you stay up
Tap you so you wake up  fine is a day job
You are getting laid off
Oh  you are just an LA girl  I will never fall for
Oh  spoiled little LA girl  I don't really need that
Oh  you are just an LA girl acting like you own the world
Stupid little LA girl  I don't really need that
Big butt and a face like Cali  takes
More than a pretty face to wow me
She can't go anywhere without me
She's an LA girl and she never been to Cali
If lodging if lodging is a problem is a problem there's a hotel
There's a hotel that can solve it
Oh  you are just an LA girl I will never fall for
Oh  spoiled little LA girl  I don't really need that
Oh you are just an LA girl acting like you own the world
Stupid little LA girl  I don't really need that
Big butt and a face like Cali
Takes more than a pretty face to wow me
She can't go anywhere without me
She's an LA girl and she never been to Cali
Big butt and a face like Cali
Takes more than a pretty face to wow me
She can't go anywhere without me
She's an LA girl and she never been to Cali
