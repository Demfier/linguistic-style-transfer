(Intro)
I got a long intro and nutin to say,
I jus awanna ask 1 question hear me out.

How we Livin'?
My east side niggas how we livin?
How we Livin'?
My bullet proof west how we livin?
How we Livin?
My niggas up north how we livin?
How we Livin?
My niggas dwn south how we livin?

How we livin? How we livin? My niggas how we livin?

Sinning, coz dats the onli way we fink we're winnning.
Killing, coz dats the onli language people listen to.
Slingin, coz thats all u can manage wen u've been into Prison
Forbidden to listen, good riddens to bad rubbish we dnt know how 2 forgive we hold grudges, and we dnt how 2
recieve we throw punches and we dnt kno how to belive.

(Verse 1)
That there's too much drama, I feel like walking road with two straps and armour, all we care about is
funds and garms, guns and arms.
The best chik on ur arm, the best watch on ur wrist, u best watch ur wrist coz them boys are, best cop ur
blist coz dem boys are, best tint ur whip like them boys cars.
But I dnt wanna be cocking it bak and everywhere i go watching my bak, I jus wanna hop on a track do my
thing not put on an act, I dnt eevn wanna put on bling, fuk up go to jail get put on a wing, got my own mind
neva been put on a string, coz i jus wanna be the best, I dnt wanna do shows and be in a vest.

(Chorus)
Live life to the fullest coz life can be taken away.
Be careful with bullets coz bullets can easily spray.
If he's ready to pull it u better be ready to react
If its duck, buck or say F**K and get back.

(Verse 2)
Coz there's too much war, some need a strap jus to go to the corner store, but is it worth the stress
baking in a vest, wen head shots can take in him the vest, take the bigger steps then u soon can take the
bigger cheque, coz wen a gun goes off in ur head u will be heading for a closed coffin, im dreading that my
times up soon mite die with the 9's up soon, or do suttin dumb and get picked out of the line up soon, coz im
in two minds and i kno wots wrong and i know wots rite, and i kno im strong and i dnt jus say this shit wen i write!.

(Chorus)
Live life to the fullest coz life can be taken away.
Be careful with bullets coz bullets can easily spray.
If he's ready to pull it u better be ready to react
If its duck, buck or say F**K and get back.

How we Livin'?
My east side niggas how we livin?
How we Livin'?
My bullet proof west how we livin?
How we Livin?
My niggas up north how we livin?
How we Livin?
My niggas dwn souf how we livin?

(Chorus)
Live life to the fullest coz life can be taken away.
Be careful with bullets coz bullets can easily spray.
If he's ready to pull it u better be ready to react
If its duck, buck or say F**K and get back.
