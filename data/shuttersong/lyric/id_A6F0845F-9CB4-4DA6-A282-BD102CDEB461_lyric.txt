We can do whatever you want today
I know that I've been keeping you when
I know that I was taking your love for granted
But I always wanted you right there
There's no use, in getting mad
You had to know I was coming back
For you I'd do it all, as if you didn't already know that

Cause you carry me
And it would be bitter sweet
If you weren't here, then where would I be
Cause you carry me
It would be bitter sweet
If you weren't here, where would I be

I was out living my life so careless
I never meant to make you feel second base
There's no use, in getting mad
You had to know, I was coming back
For you I'd do it all, as if you didn't already know that

Cause you carry me
And it would be bitter sweet
If you weren't here, then where would I be

We have all the time in the world
Remember I have much to learn
With you I wanna live a life
It's been so long, I kept you waiting
You carry me
It would be bitter sweet
If you weren't here, then where would I be
Yeah, yeah

Cause you carry me
It would be bitter sweet
If you weren't here, then where would I be
Yeah, yeah
You carry me
It would be bitter sweet
If you weren't here, then where would I be

You carry me
It would be better sweet
If you weren't here, then where would I be

Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah

You carry me
