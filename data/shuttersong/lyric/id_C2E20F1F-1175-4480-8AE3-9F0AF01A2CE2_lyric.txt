 I'm right back to work when that break ends
Oh, it's just me, myself and  I
Solo ride until  I die
Cause  I got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh  I don't need a hand  to hold
Even  when the night is cold
 I got  that fire in my soul
 I don't need anything  to get me through the night
Just the beat  that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
(Keeps me alive)
 I don't need anything  to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
Yeah, and  I don't like talking  to strangers
So get the fuck off me  I 'm anxious
 I 'm tryna be cool but  I might just go ape shit
Say fuck y'all  to all of y'all faces
It changes though now  that  I 'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But  I love it the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
 I found how  to cope with my anger
 I 'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor my liver is muddy
But it's all good  I 'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random,  I didn't get lucky
Made it  right here cause  I 'm sick with it Cudi
They all take the money for granted
But don't want  to  work for now tell me, isn't it funny?
Oh, it's just me, myself and  I
Solo ride until  I die
Cause  I got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh  I don't need a hand  to hold
Even  when the night is cold
 I got  that fire in my soul
 I don't need anything  to get me through the night
Just the beat  that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
(Keeps me alive)
 I don't need anything  to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
Like ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
Yeah, lonely nights  I laid awake
Pray  to lord, my soul  to take
My heart's become too cold  to  break
Know  I 'm great but  I 'm broke as hell
Having dreams  that  I 'm folding cake
All my life  I've been told  to wait
But  I'mma get it now it's no debate
Oh, it's just me, myself and  I
Solo ride until  I die
Cause  I got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh  I don't need a hand  to hold
Even  when the night is cold
 I got  that fire in my soul
 I don't need anything  to get me through the night
Just the beat  that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
(Keeps me
