So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a really long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

Whoa oooh ohhh whoa oooh ohhh whoa oooh ohhh whoa oooh ohhh

You've got pep in your step
You live your life with no regret
How you look when you are wet
Is something I cannot forget
I just wanna kiss your lips
The ones between your hips
If I cash in all my chips on you
Then baby i'd be rich

(so come on)
Sexy, please text me
I'm ready for you
(so come on)
Waiting, i'm begging
So please get here soon
