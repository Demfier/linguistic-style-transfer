Uh me and my niggas trying to get it ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond Let it Burn came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustling all day this a way that a way
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel
A dollar might say fuck them niggas
That you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel
A dollar might turn to a million
And we all rich that's just how I feel
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big balling with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we poor ya bish
Another casualty at war ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirting
Gang signs out the window ya bish
Hoping all of em offend you ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobody's home
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustling all day this a way that a way
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel
A dollar might say fuck them niggas
That you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel
A dollar might turn to a million
And we all rich that's just how I feel
Be the last one out to get this dough no way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes no way
Hit the streets then we break the code no way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol no way
Be the last one out to get this dough no way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes no way
Hit the streets then we break the code no way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol no way
Imagine Rock up in the projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and got them bands
Just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy
Niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises
Steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it
Where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater
Under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded
Under a money tree
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustling all day this a way that a way
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel
