Dollars signs
Said fuck this shit, you know what's on my mind
Stay on your hustle, you'll be on your grind
Whip out your heart and lift it on the line
You're running out of time
You lose your mind, you lose your fucking mind
You lose your mind, you lose your fucking mind
You close your eyes, you're seeing dollar signs, dollar signs

I told you once, ain't gotta tell you twice (No, no)
If life's a game I'm throwing loaded dice (Loaded dice)
These are the girls, ain't really what you like, what you like (No)
Feeling like running away (Away)
Stressing 'bout nothing all day
Money and hoes, come and they go
Let them go, fuck 'em away
Everything ain't what it seems, if it's not just a dream
I believe it, I believe it

Love is something vicious
Still it isn't right
Seeing all them secrets in your eyes
Leave me in the middle
Underneath the lights
You know I ain't got no chill tonight
(No chill no chill no) Got no chill tonight
(No chill no chill no) Got no chill tonight
(No chill no chill no) Got no chill tonight
(No chill no chill no) Got no chill tonight
