Yeah, I'm doing it right
Yeah, I'm doing it right

Okay your mom is talking to you
Saying clean up the basement
While the money's talking to me
That's personification

Paper in my hand
Til' the day that I'm finished
And yeah a hater's just a fan
That is scared to admit it

But I get it
A preconceived notion
That you can't like us
Cause your friends don't

You generic like a #2 pencil
Eventually,
You will be blowing on a whistle
At ymca leaves every sunday with your kinfolk

I'm coming around the mountain
I'm just finding my way
And all I really wanna do in my life
Is make someone's day

And get paid from time to time
All that I'm trying to say
Is that I can't see why you hate
When I'm just doing my thing

I don't give a damn about what you say
Whatever comes out your mouth
Those are meaningless words
That I don't worry about

I don't give a damn about what you say
I'm just living my life
You hating on the internet
While I'm catching my flight

I'm doing it right
Doing it right, doing it right, doing it right
Doing it right, doing it right, doing it right
Yeah, I'm doing it right
Yeah, yeah

Alright
(Doing it right)
Yeah we've benn singing and rapping
Since back in preschool
Just tryna make the money
At the rate that theives do

Millions of eyes on me, feeling
Like I'm see-through
I see through your bullshit
Trust me, I don't need you
I don't

No bragging, no boasting
No I don't pretend
Always stay grounded
Like a bad kid on the weekend

You hate me? Oh well
Top floor suite, hotel
You down and out sitting on your coach
And I'm happy as pharrel

That's for real
(That's for real)

Know a damn I don't give one
We gon' get this money while we're still young, yeah
While we're still young

Know a damn I don't give one
We gon' get this money while we're still young
While we're still young, yeah

I don't give a damn about what you say
Whatever comes out your mouth
Those are meaningless words
That I don't worry about

I don't give a damn about what you say
I'm just living my life
You hating on the internet
While I'm catching my flight

I'm doing it right
Doing it right, doing it right, doing it right
Doing it right, doing it right, doing it right
Yeah, I'm doing it right
Yeah, I'm doing it right
