Who's gonna listen 
?When you run out of lies?
?Who's gonna hear you 
?When your words seem worthless?
?Who's gonna save you 
?When you're out of time?
?And who's gonna want you
?When you're on your knees begging?
?Oh, please take me, I'm aware I'm desperate
?I say I never meant to hurt no one, no oh
?Please stay for what it's worth, I'm desperate
?You're on your own
?So don't you call my name
?I will take you down
?Surely know that you've been dancing with a wolf
?So don't you call my name
?I will take you down
?I'm not your friend, you burned the bridge 
?I'll show you, I could snitch you out
?Oh, there's no love for a liar
?No love for a liar
?Oh, there's no love for a liar
No love, so don't you call my name
?No one to listen
?When you're running your mouth
No one to hear you
?When your words seem worthless
?No one to save you
?When you're coming down
?No one to want you
?When you're on your knees begging
?Oh, please take me, I'm aware I'm desperate
I say I never meant to hurt no one, no oh
Please stay for what it's worth, I'm desperate
You're on your own
So don't you call my name
?I will take you down
?Surely know that you've been dancing with a wolf?

Oh, there's no love for a liar
No love for a liar
Oh, there's no love for a liar
No love, so don't you call my name
Fool me once, it's shame on you
?Fool me twice and let the wolves come crashing through
?Fool me once, it's shame on you
Fool me twice and let the wolves come
?So don't you call my name
I will take you down
Surely know that you've been dancing with a wolf
Don't you call my name
I will take you down
Surely know that you've been dancing with a wolf
