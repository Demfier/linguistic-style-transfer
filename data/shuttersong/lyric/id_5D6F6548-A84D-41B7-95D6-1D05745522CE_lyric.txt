Fashion slave 
You protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's
Like an anarchist's cookbook
(Look good 
Posin' in the centerfold of Crook Book)
Black on black on black with the ski mask 
That is my crook look
How you like my stylin'  bruh  
Ain't nobody smilin'  bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up
Like Riker's Island  bruh
Where my thuggers and my cripples
And my blooders and my brothers 
When you niggas gon' unite
And kill the police  mothafuckas 
And take over a jail 
Give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur 
Goddamn I love the smell
Now get to pillow torchin' 
Where the fuck the warden 
And when you find him 
We don't kill him  we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom
Cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die 
Fuck it  the Lord'll sort 'em
We out a order  your honor 
You're out a order
This whole court is unimportant 
You fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a flip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar
Before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian 
I'm fucked from the jump
I wear my Yankee
So tilted I actually walk with a hunch
Look at Mikey  I think he likey 
We are sinister sons
(And we the type to greet the preacher
With a grin and a gun)
Run them jewels fast 
Run them  run them jewels fast
Run them  run them  r-run them 
R-run them  run them  r-run them
Run them jewels fast 
Run them  run them jewels fast
Run them  run them  r-run them 
R-run them  run them  r-run them
A wise man once said 
("We all dead  fuck it")
Just spit it disgustin' youngin'
And hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened  tatted the sentence
On my dick last summer
Now I'll never get
That phrase off my brain 
It's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts 
I got hundreds  honey
The cheaper the parts 
The better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin' 
Glistenin'  waitin' for the christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in
A dirty boy who come down on the side dissonance
I can't even relax
Without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you  little buddy 
This fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the
Act of conjugal visitin'
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus 
They keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain 
The villain is given' vision
The vision becomes a vow
To seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians 
Profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers
And slavers of men and women
Includin' members of clergy
That rule on you through religion
(He'll strip your kids to the nude
And then tell 'em God will forgive 'em)
Run them jewels fast 
Run them  run them jewels fast
Run them  run them  r-run them 
R-run them  run them  r-run them
Run them jewels fast 
Run them  run them jewels fast
Run them  run them  r-run them 
R-run them  run them  r-run them
It's De La on the cut 
Liftin' 6 on your snitchin' crew
I'm miles ahead of you 
You can sip my bitches brew
My battle status is burnin' mansions
From Dallas to Malibu
Check my r¨¦sum¨¦ 
Your residence is residue
Call her a skin job
And my honey dip'll backflip for you
You playin'  God your eye sockets 
She gon' rip in two
We sick of bleedin' out a trace 
Spray a victim  you
Done dyin'  Phillip AK Dickin' you
With clips in the bottom 
We dippin' from Gotham
Yes eclipsed by the shadows 
A dark dance to the coffin
I'm a fellow with melanin 
Suspect of a felony
Ripped like Rakim Allah 
Feds is checkin' my melody
Yes aggressively tested
We'll bump stretchers and penalties
Dump cases with face and the cop pleas
When we seizin' a pump
With reason to dump on
You global grand dragons
Still pilin' fast  plus Afghani toe taggin'
Now they trackin' me and we bustin' back  see
The only thing that close quicker
Than our caskets be the factories
Run them jewels fast 
Run them  run them jewels fast
Run them  run them  r-run them 
R-run them  run them  r-run them
Run them jewels fast 
Run them  run them jewels fast
Run them  run them  r-run them 
R-run them  run them  r-run them
Fuck the slow
