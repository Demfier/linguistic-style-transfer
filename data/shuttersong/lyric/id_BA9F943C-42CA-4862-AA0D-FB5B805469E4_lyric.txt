On Monday I had drinks with Barney Rubble 
We hit a couple divy little bars 
We noticed there was quite a lovely lady 
Sitting at the table next to ours 
Now Barney, who was pretty friggin' wasted Got up and stumbled over with a groan 
He said: "Hey, just between us, my neanderthalic penis is as massive as a stegosaurus bone!" 
All Cartoons are fuckin' dicks 
They get their kicks from being pricks 
It's a quirk, we just can't fix 
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks 
Meg: "Did Barney really say that?" 
Peter: "Oh, yeah! He is a bastard." 
Lois: "Wow!" 
Peter: "An-And he really does not give a damn about the feelings of women! 
Ah, aah. it's Sad! It's really sad..."
Brian: "Well you think that's bad, listen to this¡­" 
One day I met an ape of great charisma 
Magilla the Gorilla was his name 
He wore a little hat and matching bowtie 
A fashion witch has brought him great acclaim 
I said: "What do you see as your career-peak; of all your many flashy escapades?"
He said: "Well this is funky, but you're looking at the monkey 
who's responsible for bringing you the AIDS. "
