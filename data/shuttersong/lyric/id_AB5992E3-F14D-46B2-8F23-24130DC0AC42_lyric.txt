I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

All I want for Christmas is you, is you... is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow

I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake

To hear those magic reindeers' click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding onto me so tight
What more can I do?
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining

So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
You're all I want, you're all I need
On Christmas day baby, you and me
You're all I want, you're all I need
On Christmas day baby, you and me
