You ready, let's go

Yeah, for those of you that want to know
What we're all about, it's like this, y'all c'mon

It's just ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know
But no, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and makin' some noise, makin' the story
Makin' sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up

Who the hell is he anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone's help, to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

It's just twenty percent skill, eighty percent fear
Be one hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreckin' with the Crystal Method, name of the game
Came back dropped Mega def, took 'em to church
I'm like, bleach, man, why you have the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
His stock's through the roof I heard with S-dot

It's just ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu the sick and he's spitting fire at Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot found him in fort minor with Tak
Been an nihilist porcupine, he's a, he's a
The type woman want to be with and rappers hope he get
Eight years in the makin', patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime his is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top, people think it's a common owners name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym

No he's livin' proof, got him rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doing give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind

It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those are the fellows, he runs with, those kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it

It's just ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

It's just ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Yeah, Fort Minor, M. Shinoda
