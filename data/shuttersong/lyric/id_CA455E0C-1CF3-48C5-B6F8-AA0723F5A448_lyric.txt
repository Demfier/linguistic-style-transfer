Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my hand
and some blonde gave me nightmares, I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead.

With an ironclad fist, I wake up and french kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
about love, the truth, what you mean to me
and the truth is, baby you're all that I need.

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oo... I wanna be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses.

Well, I'm so far away
Each step that I take is on my way home
a king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night
to speak through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, baby blind love is true

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
I wanna be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses.

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
Well I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died.

Now as you close your eyes, know I'll be thinking about you
while my mistress she calls me to stand in her spotlight again
tonight, I won't be alone but you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
i've got nothing to prove
for it's you that I'd die to defend.
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
i want to be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is
and lay you down on a bed of roses.
