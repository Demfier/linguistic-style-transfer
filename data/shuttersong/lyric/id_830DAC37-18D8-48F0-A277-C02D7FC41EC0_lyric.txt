My lover's got humor\n
 She's the giggle at a funeral\n Knows everybody's disapproval\n I should've worshiped her sooner\n If the Heavens ever did speak\n She's the last true mouth piece\n Every Sunday's getting more bleak\n A fresh poison each week\n We were born sick  you heard them say it\n My church offers no absolutes\n She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'\n The only heaven I'll be sent to\n Is when I'm alone with you\n I was born sick  but I love it\n Command me to be well\n Amen  Amen  Amen\n Take me to church\n I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your life\n I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\n Offer me that deathless heaven\n Good god  let me give you my life\n Take me to church\n I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\n I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\n Offer me that deathless death\n Good god  let me give you my life\n If I'm a pagan of the good times\n My lover's the sunlight\n To keep the goddess on my side\n She demands a sacrifice\n To drain the whole sea\n Get something shiny\n Something meaty for the main course\n That's a fine looking high horse\n What you got in the stable \n We've a lot of starving faithful\n That looks tasty\n That looks plenty\n This is hungry work\n Take me to church\n I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\n I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\n Offer me my deathless death\n Good god  let me give you my life\n Take me to church\n I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\n I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\n Offer me my deathless death\n Good god  let me give you my life\n No masters or kings when the ritual begins\n There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin\n In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene\n Only then I am human\n Only then I am clean\n Amen  Amen  Amen\n Take me to church\n I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\n I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\n Offer me that deathless death\n Good god  let me give you my life\n Take me to church\n I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\n I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\n Offer me that deathless death\n Good god  let me give you my life\n Take Me to Church - Hozier
