.Ohh
Yeah

Baby please stay near
Don't know how I'd live without you here
It feels like I'm drowning I've got no air
My life is nothing without you here

So baby, please don't leave me now

Don't leave me now
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Don't let me go
You've got something I can't describe
You're the one I've wanted my whole life
What ever happen to the times we'll share

So baby, pleace don't leave me now

Don't leave me now
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Oooo, don't let me go
You built me up then
You break me down
You could break my heart

Without a sound
You've got the softest touch
And no deceit
No money or car could change
What you mean to me
Cause I'm falling in love with you
And I just can't help myself
Cause I'm falling in love with you
And I just can't help myself
So please don't go
Don't leave me now
Don't let me go
