I ride for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s
I slide for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s dawg

Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s

Damn, life so short, f-ck it, I don't wanna go to court
F-ck it, got a budget for the lawyer though
F-ck it, I'm on the run for the money
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' nigg-s thuggin', even got me paranoid
I'm gettin' money, that's in any n-gga category
Double M I got G's out in California

I ride for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s
I slide for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s dawg

Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s

It bothers me when the GODS get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with nigg-s like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with nigg-s like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up nigg-s that's all
Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap change
There was a time it was rugged
Back when if a n-gga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays n-ggas reach, just to sell they record
Spaguetti bolognese in the Polo lounge
Me and my G from DC, that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think drake would pull some sh-t like that you never know
Million dollar meetings in tha polo lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shorty wanted to tell me secrets about a rap n-gga
I told that b-tch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe about to lose a hundred fifty M's
Kobe my n-gga I hated it had to be him
B-tch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym

(huh!? b-tch you weren't with me shooting in the gym)

Tell lucien, and I say f-ck it
I'm tearing holes my budget
Bag it like we in Publix
And take her ass out in public
Order her a filet told her butterflies, she'll love it
She's used to soda and nuggets, she's really just out here thugging
I'm just here in my pinecle
You a pussy identical
You like the f-cking finish line
We can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that young rich m-therf-cking getting mine off rap
where my n-ggas!

I ride for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s
I slide for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s dawg

Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s

From the hoopty coupe to the Ghost dawg
Pigeons on the roof like ghost dawg
Dwight howard in the post dawg
My nigg-s got the powder through the post dawg
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Nigg-s lost mills tryna beat the feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my n-gga Mac 75
Then gave my n-gga penthouse in another 30
F-ck got me thinking like Im 75
Damn, n-gga aint even seen 30
I ride for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s
I slide for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s dawg
Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
