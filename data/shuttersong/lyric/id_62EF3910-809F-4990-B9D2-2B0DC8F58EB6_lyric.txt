Uh oh oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy when I see you
It's hard to just walk passed yah
Yeah, you got close
And my heart starts beatin' faster
I try to play it cool
Just like I'm an actor
but I'm see-through
And it ends up in disaster

Got me reelin'
I'm on the ceiling
Uh uh
And I can't help it
this love is

what I'm feelin'
After you leave
that's when I'm dreaming
'Bout how happy we could be
but i get lost at sea
It's like a tidal wave
and it keeps on washin' over
I try to fight it but I
still wanna hold ya
Tidal wave
and I just can't let it go now

cause you know things
might be happ'ning
like they're s'pposed to
Maybe it's love

that's happen for us
And maybe it's love
that's happen for us
Boy when I see you
my heart goes pitter patter

I wanna be with you
happ'ly ever after
and when you're near me
it just feels so much better
so say you're mine
so that we can be together
Got me reelin'
I'm on the ceiling
Uh uh
And I can't help it
this love is

what I'm feelin'
After you leave
that's when I'm dreaming
'Bout how happy we could be
but i get lost at sea
It's like a tidal wave
and it keeps on washin' over
I try to fight it but I

still wanna hold ya
Tidal wave
and I just can't let it go now
cause you know things

might be happ'ning
like they're s'pposed to
Maybe it's love
that's happen for us
And maybe it's love
that's happen for us

You keep washin' over me baby
so I just can't help myself
like a tidal wave that's got me
I can't be with no one else
and it's emotions like the ocean
I keep coming back for more
so please say you love me too
don't leave me sitting on the shore
And I will be your one and only
and together we will be
so baby please just say you love me
don't leave me out at sea
It's like a tidal wave
and it keeps on washin' over
I try to fight it but I
still wanna hold ya
Tidal wave
and I just can't let it go now
cause you know things
might be happ'ning
like they're s'pposed to
Maybe it's love
that's happen for us
And maybe it's love
that's happen for us
