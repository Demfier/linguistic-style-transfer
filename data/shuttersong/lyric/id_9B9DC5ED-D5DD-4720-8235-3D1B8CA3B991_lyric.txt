Once more I'll say goodbye to you
Things happen, but we don't really know why
if it's supposed to be like this

why do most of us ignore the chance to miss
oh yeah

Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feeling the situation

Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me! (Me)

Yeah! (Yeah)
All these things I hate revolve around Me! (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)

Just back off before i snap

Once more you tell those lies to me
Why can't you just be straight up with honesty (honesty, honesty)
When you say those things in my ear

Why do you always tell me what you wanna hear (wana hear, wanna hear)

oh yeah (yeah!)
Wear your heart on your sleeve make things hard to believe
I'm not feeling the situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me! (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
All these things I hate revolve around me (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
Just back off before I snap and you'll see! (me)
Me! (Me)
All these things I hate revolve around me (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
Just back off before I snap

Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feeling the situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like me
(it's the best place to be when you're!)
Me! (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
All these things I hate revolve around me (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
Just back off before I snap and you'll see (Me)
Me! (Me)
All these things I hate revolve around me (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
Just back off before I snap
