Out of all the reindeers

You know you're the mastermind

Run run Rudolph

Randolph ain't too far behind

Run run Rudolph

Santa's got to make it to town

Santa make him hurry

Tell him he can take the freeway down

Run run Rudolph

'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round

Said Santa to a boy

Child what have you been longing for

All I want for Christmas is a

Rock and roll electric guitar

And then away went Rudolph

Whizzin' like a shootin' star

Run run Rudolph

Santa's got to make it to town

Santa make him hurry

Tell him he can take the freeway down

Run run Rudolph

'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round

Run like it's stolen

Said Santa to a girl

Child what would please you most to get

A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet

And then away went Rudolph

Whizzin' like a saber jet

Run run Rudolph

Santa's got to make it to town

Santa make him hurry

Tell him he can take the freeway down

Run run Rudolph

'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round

Run run Rudolph

(Run run Rudolph)

Run run Rudolph

Run run run Rudolph

(Run run Rudolph)

Run run

Run run run Rudolph

(Run run run Rudolph)

Merry Christmas everybody
