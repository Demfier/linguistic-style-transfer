Like Dear Abby told me.
(I'm walking away)
My shrink gave his O.K.
(I'm walking away)
The self help book implored me.
(I'm walking away)
Jubilation Day.

(I'm walking away)
My best friends all had warned me.
(I'm walking away)
Even your mom said you were nuts!
(In my dreams)
You wear a red cape and a pitchfork.
(I'm walking away)
Jubilation Day.

(I'm walking away)
Let me get my things.
(I'm walking away)
Where'd you hide my banjo strings!
(I'm walking away)
I'll be over you by lunch time.
(I'm walking away)
Jubilation Day.

(I'm walking away)
Let's always remember the good times.
(I'm walking away)
Like when you were out of town.
(I'm walking away)
But the sex was great!
(I'm walking away)
At least that's what my best friends brother said...
(I'm walking away)
You know you're right, we should always stay in touch.
