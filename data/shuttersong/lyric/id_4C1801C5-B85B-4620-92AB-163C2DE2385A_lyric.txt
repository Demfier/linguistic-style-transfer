I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural

What I had in mind was
What you held against me

Give me the keys and I'll drive you insane,
Take apart your brain

If you ever loved me
Never satisfied

Or just never coming back
(Stay away from me)
No, prep him for the ghost
Let him see the ghost
(Stay away from me)
Let it in and come to terms with what would have, could have been
(Stay away from me)
Prep him for the weight
Let him see the fate
(Stay away from me)
Fracturing relationships

And isolation
Do you wanna get mad about...

All your feelings won't change the world
Do you wanna get mad about...

Saying nothing, being nothing, be with someone else

I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural

What I had in mind was
What you held against me.

Give me the keys and I'll drive you insane,
Take apart your brain.
If you ever loved me,
Never satisfied
Or just never coming back!
(Stay away from me)
No, prep him for the ghost.
Let him see the ghost
(Stay away from me)
Let it in and come to terms with what would have, could have been.
(Stay away from me)

Prep him for the weight,
Let him see the fate.
(Stay away from me)
Fracturing relationships
And isolation.
Before you decide that this is dated,
Take me out of the equation.
What was it that you most hated?
All the time that you spent waiting!
When the stomach becomes the mouth and it's spewing all it's garbage out.
To think before speaking would prevent you from the point your making.
When the stomach becomes the mouth and it's spewing all it's garbage out.
To think before speaking would prevent you from the point your making.
The slew of trails towards destiny, the perfect day to quit.
The slew of trails in reverie, bite my crooked shape.
