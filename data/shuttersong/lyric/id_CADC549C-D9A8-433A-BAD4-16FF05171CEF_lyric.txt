Mama said, you're a pretty girl
What's in your head it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down

Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says
Thinner is better

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down

Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Ain't no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside
And nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You left a shattered mirror
And the shards of a beautiful girl

Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

When you'r alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself
It's just a way to masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself
Are you happy with yourself
Yes
