I hope you know he's the last one fighting for you
I hope you know he's been dead wrong
I hope you see that in time you questioned Every thing that you spent,
Is it really worth trying for,
And all the pain that you had,
To really worth fighting for,
Coz they got you falling so much deeper,
You're running the thoughts that come between ya,
And I have to see your fire fading,
I hope you don't mind what I'm saying,
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest
Let me be honest
Hmm...
Just being honest,
Yea you deserve someone that's honest,
Yea you deserve someone that's honest,
I hope you find out what's been missing,
I hope you get the chance to find yourself again,
I hope you find the strength to leave him oohh,
