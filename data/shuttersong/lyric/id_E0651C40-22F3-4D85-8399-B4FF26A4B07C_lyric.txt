Groove - Sho-T / Brenda
The night is hot I think I'm going to have some fun
It's 12 o'clock But it looks like the party's just begun
Walked in the club Tonight I'm gonna make my move
When I saw you I knew exactly what do do
I go up I go down Spins my head all around
It's your eyes It's your style I wanna make you mine
There's one thing I must know On the floor this will show
Baby So feel the rhythm and let it flow
Groove boy groove Can't all that booty be all yours
Move Let's move Ev'body get down on the floor
Dance Let's dance Can't all that booty be all yours
Move Let's move So boogie some more
Groove boy groove Can't all that booty be all yours
Move Let's move Ev'body get down on the floor
Dance Let's dance Can't all that booty be all yours
Move Let's move So boogie some more
Baby let's groove
