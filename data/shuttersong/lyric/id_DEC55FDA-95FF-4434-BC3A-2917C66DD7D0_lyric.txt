Like mom's not home
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long
One, two, three.
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home
Tell me why the best things feel so wrong
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long
Run with the feeling
of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home
Just a couple kids livin' on our own
