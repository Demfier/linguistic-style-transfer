[Madilyn Bailey:]
I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows 
We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close split 
Second and you disappeared 
And then I was all alone

I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever (we're standing)
I won't take you for (granted)
We'll never know when
When we'll run out (of time)
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna lose you (I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna lose you

[Chris Collins:]
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the 
Minutes and love with no regrets

[Both:]
Let's take our time
To say what we want
Use what we got
Before it's all gone
('Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow)

I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
We'll never know when
When we'll run out of time 
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna lose you (I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
Like I'm gonna lose you
