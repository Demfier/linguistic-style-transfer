Breaking up is hard to do, yeah
Everyone's doing it but, me and you
If I had nothing but a dollar in my pocket, I'd spend it on you
cus I know your love is priceless
Tell me where you wanna go (oh) I don't know how we'll
get there, but we'll be close I'll be your pillow, lay your head
up on me baby, there won't be no sleepless nights
So I'm not afraid, of losing our way, cus it's not an option
it's not a game, as they fall apart, we reach for the stars
I know this, yeah baby
No one compares it's just not fair, to everyone that doesn't
have you, guess I'm the lucky one, I guess I'm the lucky one
I promise this with every kiss, my hearts in this
Tell it to everyone (tell it to everyone)
That I'm the lucky one, guess I'm the lucky one (o, oo, baby)
Listen, everydays a holiday cus every time I think about you
it's a sweet escape, I close my eyes and see you naked in
my bedroom, your just so sexy to me
I'm not afraid, of losing our way, cus it's not an option
it's not a game, as they fall apart, we reach for the stars
I know this, yeah
That no one compares it's just not fair, to everyone that
doesn't have you, guess I'm the lucky one, I guess I'm the
lucky one I promise this with every kiss, my hearts in this
Tell it to everyone (tell it to everyone)
That I'm the lucky one, guess I'm the lucky one (o, oo, yeah)
No one compares it's just not fair, to everyone that doesn't have you, guess, I'm the lucky one, baby
I promise this with every kiss, my hearts in this
Tell it to everyone (tell it to everyone)
That I'm the lucky one, guess I'm the lucky one (oo, oo, oo)
