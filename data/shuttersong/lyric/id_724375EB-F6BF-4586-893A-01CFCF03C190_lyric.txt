I can't see
Why people look at me

And only see the color of my face
Yes they do

And then there's those
That try to help, god knows

But have to always put me in my place
Now I won't ask you to be color blind

'Cause if you pick the fruit
Then girl, you're sure to find...

The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice

I could say it ain't so
But darlin', what's the use?

The darker the chocolate
The richer the taste

And that's where it's at...
... now run and tell that!

Run and tell that!

Run and tell that!

I can't see
Why people disagree
Each time I tell them what I know is true

And if you come
And see the world I'm from
I bet your heart is gonna feel it too
Yeah. I could lie

But baby. Let's be bold
Vanilla be nice
But if the truth be told...
The blacker the berry

The sweeter the juice
I could say it ain't so

But darlin', what's the use
The darker the chocolate

The richer the taste
And That's where it's at

Now run and tell that!
ENSEMBLE
Run and tell that!

SEAWEED
This is my sister, Li'l Inez.
TRACY
Yeah, I saw you at the auditions.

LI'L INEZ
Well, you're the only one who
Did, 'cause they kicked me out
On my young, gifted and black

Behind.
SEAWEED
Tell 'em about it!

LI'L INEZ
I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride
SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE
So give me five on the black-hand side
LI'L INEZ
I've got a new way of movin'
And I got my own voice
SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE
So how can I help
But to shout and rejoice
LI'L INEZ
The people 'round here
Can barely pay their rent
They're \
