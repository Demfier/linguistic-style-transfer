Do you remember?
Back when, we fell in love in your best friends basement
Spun the bottle and hoped it would land on you
Thought we were cool, listening to Zeppelin
Making out on the stairway to heaven
Nowhere to go, so we slept out on the roof

But now, we hardly even speak, at all
Looking back, how did we get away?

I never thought that we'd surrender
When i was yours and you were mine
Never regret, now we learned how to love
When we were young

When we were young

Snuck out in your daddy's ride
at the drive in, makking love for the first time
Forget the silver screen, it's a wonderful life

But now, we hardly even speak, at all

Looking back, how did we get away?
I never thought that we'd surrender
When i was yours and you were mine
Never regret, now we learned how to love
When we were young and still together

No, there was nothing left to prove
Never regret now we learned how to love
...
When we were young and reckless

Dumb and fearless
Fighting in the streets

Will you remember me?
Young forever, back then
Never knew the first love's the hardest
I never thought that we'd surrender
When I was yours and you were mine
Never regret, now we learned how to love
When we were young and still together
No, there was nothing left to prove
Never regret, now we learned how to love
When we were young
When we were young.
When we were young.
