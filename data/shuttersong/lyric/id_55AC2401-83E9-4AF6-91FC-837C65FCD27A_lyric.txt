Walking through a crowd
The village is a globe
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats Under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn¡¯t heard before
And it said
Welcome to New York
It¡¯s been waiting for you¡¢

Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It¡¯s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It¡¯s a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It¡¯s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York


When we first dropped our bags
On apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It¡¯s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It¡¯s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love
It keeps you guessing
Like any real love
It¡¯s ever changing
Like any true love
It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn¡¯t change Anything, anything, anything¡­

Welcome to New York
It¡¯s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It¡¯s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
