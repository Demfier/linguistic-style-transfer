Ku hitung detik waktu
Memikirkan kamu tiada habisnya
Kau di detak jantungku
Di setiap nafasku tiada gantinya
Kau segalanya yg bermakna
I just wanna hold you
I just wanna kiss you
I just wanna love you all of my life
I normally wouldn't say this
But i just can't contain it
I want you here forever right here by my side
All the fears you feel inside
And all the tears you've cried
They are ending right here
I'll heal your hardened soul
I'll keep you oh so close
Don't worry, i'll never let you go
You're all I need, you're everything
I just wanna hold you
I just wanna kiss you
I just wanna love you all my life
I normally wouldn't say this
But i just can't contain it
I want you here forever right here by my side
Siapa yg kan menyangka aku tergila-gila
Dengarlah sekali lagi, i love you
Tiada yang lain lagi
Hatiku tlah terkunci, cuma kamu
I just wanna hold you
I just wanna kiss you
I just wanna love you all my life
I normally wouldn't say this
But i just can't contain it
I want you here forever right here by my side
Oooh hold you kiss you
I just wanna love you all my life
I normally wouldn't say this
But i just can't contain it
I want you here forever right here by my side
