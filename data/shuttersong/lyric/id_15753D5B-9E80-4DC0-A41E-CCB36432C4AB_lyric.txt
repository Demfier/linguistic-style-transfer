You got the Love (《年轻气盛》电影插曲) - The Retrosettes Sister Band
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying lord I just don't care
You've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying lord I just don't care
You've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
You've got the love I need to see me through
Oh you've got the love
You've got the love
You've got the love I need to see me through
Oh you've got the love
You've got the love
You've got the love I need to see me through
Kings go wrong and you are my daily meal
Oh oh I know
I know my saviour's love is real
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
I need to see me through
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
I need to see me through
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying lord I just don't care
You've got the love I need to see me through
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
I need to see me through
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
I need to see me through
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
