Feels like going to cartoon
Lovestruck, shower the harpoon
Flying high as a balloon
And I ain't coming down
God no nothing around you
But I'm trying, trying to play it cool
Don't want to rush it too soon
I'm keeping you around
Superstitiously
I'm watching my words, all of my words now
Like a birthday wish don't say it out loud
Never out loud

Yeah I want to tell everyone that you are, you are my only one
Scream it at the top of my lungs
But I'm whispering, I'm whispering I'm whispering
Cause I don't want to jinx it

Blue birds flying round my head
Wet dreams swimming round my bed
Eyes closed living the bed land
Hoping you will stay
Fingers crossed when I kiss you
Knocking we're gonna miss you
Acting like teenage fool
When you walk with me
