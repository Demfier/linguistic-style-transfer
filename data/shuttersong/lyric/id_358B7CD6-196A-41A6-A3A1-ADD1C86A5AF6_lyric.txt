Hey baby

Tell me your name
I got a
fever for you
I just can't explain
But there's just one problem
I'm a bit old school
When it comes to loving
I ain't chasing you
Ain't waiting
I'm on a roll

You've got to let yourself

go
Oh

You know that I've been waiting for you
Don't leave me standing all by myself

'Cause I ain't looking at no one else
Hey
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think
that I

might fall (Woo!)
Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early

Just what I want
So when
we move
You move
Hey

Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot
I think

that I
might fall

Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when we move
You move

Oh silly
Why you afraid?
Don't be a big baby
Quit playing games
Put your arms around me

You know what to do
And we can take it down, low
Oh

You know that I've been waiting for you
Don't leave me standing all by myself
Cause I ain't looking at no one else
Looking at no one else
Hey
Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable

Looking so hot

I think
that I
might fall
Feeling like it's my bibrthday
Like Christmas day came early
Just what I want
So when
we move

You move

Get your back off the wall
Don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot (Yeah!)
I think
that I
might fall

Feeling like it's my birthday
Like Christmas day came early (Early! Yeahh)
Just what I want

So when we move
You move
I know that you wanna
But you can't cause you gotta
Stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna

move
So move
I know that you wanna

But you can't cause you gotta
Stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna
move
So move
Move it baby, oh!
You know that I've been waiting for you (Ooh!)
Don't leave me standing all by myself
Cause I ain't looking at no one else
Looking at no one else
Looking at no one else
