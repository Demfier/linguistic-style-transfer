This here's a tale for all the fellas
Try to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause you're over zealous
Play hard to get an females get jealous
Ok smartie go to a party
Girls are stancin the crowd is showin body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standin on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone cold munching
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walkin guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wanna dance cus she likes the groove
So come on fat so and just bust a move
Oh yeah
Just bust a move
Oh yeah oh yeah
You're on a mission and you're wishing
Someone could cure you're lonely condition
You're looking for love in all the wrong places
Not fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
New movie's showing so you're going
Could care less about the five you're blowing
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
When you spot a fine woman sitting in the front row
She's dressed in yellow she says Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow
You run over there without a second to loose
And what comes next hey bust a move
If you want it you've got it
If you want it baby you've got it
Just bust a move
If you want it you've got it
If you want it baby you've got it
In the city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Try to tell a joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says no way
Girls a faking goodness saking
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sophistic materialistic
They're lying on the beach perpetratin a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strolling real high-rolling
Everything you have is your's and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin to prove
So don't just stand there bust a move
If you want it you've got it
If you want it baby you've got it
Just bust a move
If you want it you've got it
If you want it baby you've got
Break down for me fellows
Oh  yeah  oh  yeah 
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hoping you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neato check your libido
And roll to the churchg in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinking then you start blinking
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feeling really fine cus the girl is stacked
Reception's jumping bass is pumping
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumping
Says she wants to dance to a different groove

If you want it baby you've got it
Just bust a move

If you want it baby you've got it
