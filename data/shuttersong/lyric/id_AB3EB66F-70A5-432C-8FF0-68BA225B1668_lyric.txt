You're like shackles on my heart
Chains around my feet
I bought your dirty lies
They got the best of me
Let everything you stole haunt you in your dreams
Shame on you, shame on you

Your face is made of gold
Brighter than the stars
There's honey on your lips
But venom in your heart
You promised me the world
But you only made me bleed
Shame on you, shame on you

There's a lake of fire
Calling your name
You're the queen of liars
Stay away from me
You stabbed me in the heart while you kissed me on the cheek
Shame on you, shame on you

You live in palaces of paper
Your castles made of cards
But underneath you're crumbling
It's coming like a flood
There's nowhere you can run
But it's all that you can do
Shame on you, shame on you

There's a lake of fire
Calling your name
You're the queen of liars
Stay away from me
You stabbed me in the heart while you kissed me on the cheek
Shame on you, shame on you

I'll never be your slave again
the games you play you'll never win
Cause I'm finally free
You're sitting at the bitter end
I'm miles away from all you did
you're just a memory

There's a lake of fire
Calling your name
You're the queen of liars
Stay away from me
You stabbed me in the heart while you kissed me on the cheek
You stabbed me in the heart while you kissed me on the cheek
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
