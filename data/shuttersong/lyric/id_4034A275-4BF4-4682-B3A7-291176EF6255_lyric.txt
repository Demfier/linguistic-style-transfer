The sun is so hot
The drinks are so cold
Your clothes just fall off, as the day goes
We're gonna stay up, ain't gonna lay low
We're gonna dance all night because we say so
(Na na na)
I'm thinking maybe I can't have relationships
‘Cause lately they're not making any sense
and baby you're the one thing on my mind that can change anytime
‘Cause there's so many fine women

that my head is spinning
and I've lost all feeling
everybody's singing like
Hey!
Na na na

Hey, hey!

Na na na na
Hey!

Na na na
Hey, hey!

Na na na na

‘Cause there so many fine women
that my head is spinning
and I'm seeing double vision

everybody's singing like
Hey!
Na na na
Hey, hey!
Na na na na
Hey!
Na na na
Hey, hey!

Na na na na na
Lets do this outside
Shut down the whole block
Watch the girls drop by like it's a catwalk

We're livin' easy
We've got the whole day (whole day)
And we can go hard no matter what the cops say
(Na na na)

I'm thinking maybe I can't have relationships

‘Cause lately they're not making any sense
and baby you're the one thing on my mind that can change anytime
‘Cause there's so many fine women

and I've lost all feeling
everybody's singing like
Hey!

Hey, hey!

I see no vitals on your EKG
Dead on the dance floor
We only clap because we need more
3OH! 3 blowing out your speakers
Blowing out your speakers
‘Cause there's so many fine women
that my head is spinning
and I've lost all feeling
everybody's singing like
Hey!
Na na na
Hey, hey!
Na na na na
Hey!
