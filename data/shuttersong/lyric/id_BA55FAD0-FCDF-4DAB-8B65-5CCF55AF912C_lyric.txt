Together we cry...
Together we cry...

Jenny was a poor girl
Living in a rich world
Named her baby Hope when she was just 14
She was hoping for a better world
For this little girl
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree

Well she gets that call
Hope's too far gone
Her baby's on the way
But nothing left inside
Together we cry!

What about the junk head
Could have gone the whole way
Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal
Now he's lighting up the wrong way
Something for the pain!?
Man you wanna see this kid he was so fucking unreal
When he gets that call
He's too far gone
To get it together to sing one song
They won't hear tonight
The words of a lullaby

Together we cry... cry...
Together we cry. cry. .
Whoah oh whoah oh whoah
Together we cry...
Oh we cry we cry we cry
Together we cry...
Oh we cry we cry yeah
Oh Mary's ambitious

She wanna to be a politician
She been dreaming about it since she was a girl
She thought that she'd be the one to change the world
Always trying to pave the way
for women in a man's world
But life happened, house, kids, two cars, husband
hits the jar, cheques that don't go very far now
Now she in it - can't change it, she keeps her mind

on
her wages

The only rattling cages!
Together we cry...
Together we cry...

It's so much sad wanna flood the ocean
We all in tears for the world it's broken
Together we cry... cry...
Together we cry... cry...
There comes a time when every bird has to fly
At some point every rose has to die
It's hard to let your children go
Leave home
Where they go?
Who knows!
Getting drunk
Getting stoned
All alone
Teach a man to fish
You'll feed him never lie

You show your kids the truth
Hope they never lie
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to

something better
