That's what I'm talking about though, like you changed up

You don't even fucking link nobody no more, you just dashing away like a Taxi
Yo, you cheesed me dog
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya, shit'll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how bout now?

Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?
What about now girl? How bout now?
Always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you

I had no money, left from back when I was focused on the music

I used to always try and burn you cds of my new shit

You be like \
