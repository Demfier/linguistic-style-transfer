This is for the ladies

Don't be scared, no
I got something you have to see
So get your ass a drink
You better grab a seat
You could be my muse
Oh yeah uhuh
You could be my muse

You could be my muse

First let's just get this straight, you're just a man
But this just may be something you need to understand
It's a different day but you may just come in hand
'Cause I may need you to get down on the floor, do exactly what I say
If you catch me in my zone, it may be your lucky day
But don't get out of control cause I may lose my patience with you
Can somebody please tell me why do men try to be something they could never be

Cause us woman are a totally different pedigree
You won't believe how I can be, but you may see

Cause you could be my muse

Oh ha, yeah uhuh
You could be my muse
You could be my muse

Mama always told me not to need a man
But one thing I should know is that I have the upper hand
And if do indulge in showing him my plans
The one thing he should know is I can also wear the pants
With my fucking heels on
Looking like a real strong woman any daddy would proud to say I'm his
You just stepped into the kill zone
I just keep it real
Have you calling me your daddy

I just tell it like it is and I think it's funny cause
Men try to be something they could never be
Cause us woman are a totally different pedigree
You won't believe how I can be but you may see

Cause you could be my muse
Oh ha, yeah uhuh, alright
You could be my muse

You could be my muse
Cause you could be my muse
Oh, yeah uhuh
You could be my muse
You could be my muse

I know this woman type looking like Kryptonite
The type that will put a guy who's looking in to submission right
Where he stands damn she's bad
Somebody better call the ambulance
She's about to hurt somebody
We go way back
But she knows where I lay at
So we don't need no lame cats
And please know we don't play that
She's that chick that I'd slaughter any guy for
Cause she's been riding in my corner since 9 4
And I adore her, I'll die for her
So when you see that girl don't be whack best believe that girl is on
Boy you better please that girl and mean that or just leave that girl alone
Everything about that girl is the shit
She don't need a guy that squirms like a bitch
And money can't buy that girl cause she gets
Anything she likes and personally she's bout it bout it, hmmm
And I don't know if you can keep up
Just how's she riding on this beat
You might want to tighten up your sneakers
Hang on, here we go
She likes it on the D low
You know the game better act like you know

Hmm and if you don't want her
Or if you cannot handle it
Then be considered a goner
'Cause she cannot handle it
She needs the guy she chooses

To not be shy and truthfully if you are not that type of dude then move

Cause she can be my muse
She can be my, she can be my my my my
She can be my muse
She can be my muse
Hmm
You can be my muse
Oh yeah uhuh
You could be my muse
You could be mu muse
