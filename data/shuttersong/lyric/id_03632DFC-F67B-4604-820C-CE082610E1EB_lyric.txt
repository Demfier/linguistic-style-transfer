Well I was there on the day
They sold the cars for the queen.
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen.
I hate the ending myself
But it started with an alright scene.

It was the roar of the crowd
That gave me heartache to sing.
It was a lie when they smiled
And said, "You won't feel a thing."
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard, it would sting.

Yeah, yeah. Wo-o-o-oah.

If I'm so wrong
(So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long?
(Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing.

You're just a sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay.
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show 'em what we all mean
Yeah, yeah. Wo-o-o-oah.

If I'm so wrong

(So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long?
(Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing.
You're just a sad song, with nothing to say

About a life-long wait for a hospital stay.
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you.
So go away

Just go.
Run away.
But, where did you run to?
And where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay.
Well.
Well.
Well.
Well.
Well.
Well
You're just a sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay.
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you.
Come on!
You're just a sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay.
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you at all.
At all.
At all.
At all.
