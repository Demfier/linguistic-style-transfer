Lock off inside
More easy into callin'tonight
Move bodyes left up in the snow
The place left to go
No muks to tell
You left it if you didn't prepair

I'm freezin to fall

Uaa uaa uaa uaaa

Uaa uaa uaa uaaa

In soul to grove
To let all the gain up, to blow
No answer my love for all these
Try this in green
My love to keep
Now wated to blow
I promise, I'm too dissapointed
But we were so young
The place left to role

UuuUh

Uaa uaa uaa uaaa

Uaa uaa uaa uaaa

Please don't say that

Serching for lie in the .
For breaking the smooth in to cloe
It's all you lied

aa uaa uaa uaaa
Please.
don't feel that

Uaa uaa uaa uaaa
Please.
don't feel that

Danger stealing i want to belevi
Things are.
Walking in dezaster
