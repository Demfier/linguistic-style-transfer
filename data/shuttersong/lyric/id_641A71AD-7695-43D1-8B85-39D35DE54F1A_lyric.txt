It's friday night forget the popular kids
Let's all get lost somewhere
let's fall of the grid

Just a bunch of misfits kicking in
in the backseat of my car
to find an adventure
we don't need to go far
because
we are running in the street so
wi-i-i-ild and free-ee

They say we never be heroes
Wa-a-ait and se-e-ee
Young and broke and on the loose
The underdogs are coming through
No more sittin' on the side lines
This one is for you and me

If there's an ocean we'll jump in
If there's a tree we'll climb
Never listen to the voices telling us how to live this life

Dance like the rollin' waves
And sing like the breeze
Living in colours that they never could see

Just a bunch of dreamers
Loving it, It ain't no mystery
It's just another way of looking at things
because
we are running in the street so
wi-i-i-ild and free-ee

They say we never be heroes
Wa-a-ait and se-e-ee
Young and broke and on the loose
The underdogs are coming through
No more sittin' on the side lines
This one is for you and me

If there's an ocean we'll jump in
If there's a tree we'll climb
Never listen to the voices telling us how to live this life

We are we are we are we are
The underdogs tonight
We are we are we are we are
We are running in the street so wild and free
They say we'll never be heroes
If there's an ocean, we'll jump in
if there's a tree, we'll climb
Never listen to the voices telling us how to live this life
If theres an ocean we'll jump in
If there's a tree, we'll climb
Never listen to the voices telling us how to live this life
We are we are we are we are we are the underdogs tonight
We are we are we are we are, yeah
Never listen to the voices telling us how to live this life,
Never listen to the voices telling us how to live this life.
