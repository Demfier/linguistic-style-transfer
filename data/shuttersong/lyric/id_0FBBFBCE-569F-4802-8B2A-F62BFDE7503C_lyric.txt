Could you see yourself

Growing old with me,

Watchin' my head turn to grey?

Could you live with me

In my mistakes,

And the ones I have yet to make?

So when our eyes have seen their better days

And our hearing starts to fade

Put your arms 'round my neck, and your heart on my chest

"I Love You" will still sound the same

"I Love You" will still sound the same

 

Hey yea ey ey yea ey ey

Hey yea ey ey yea

Hey yea ey ey yea ey ey

"I Love You" will still sound the same

"I Love You" will still sound the same

 

I can see our dreams,

Inside of a child

Long after ours fade away.

When our rings start to rust

And our skin starts to age

Remember the promise we made.

So when our eyes have seen their better days

And our hearing starts to fade

Put your arms 'round my neck, and your heart on my chest

"I Love You" will still sound the same

"I Love You" will still sound the same

Hey yea ey ey yea ey ey

Hey yea ey ey yea

Hey yea ey ey yea ey ey

"I Love You" will still sound the same

"I Love You" will still sound the same

 

When bills pile up

And time tests our love

We'll stay forever in love.

We'll stick to our guns

Our grip won't loosen up

When we say forever ain't enough.

So when our eyes have seen their better days

And our hearing starts to fade

Put your arms 'round my neck, and your heart on my chest

"I Love You" will still sound the same

"I Love You" will still sound the same

Hey yea ey ey yea ey ey

Hey yea ey ey yea

Hey yea ey ey yea ey ey

"I Love You" will still sound the same

"I Love You" will still sound the same
