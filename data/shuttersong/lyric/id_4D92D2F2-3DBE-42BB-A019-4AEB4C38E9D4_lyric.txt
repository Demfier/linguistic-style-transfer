F'd up, c'mon
F'd up, c'mon
F'd up, c'mon

I won't break down tonight
I feel it for the first time
I feel it for the first time

Oh, I won't break down tonight
I feel it for the first time
I feel it for the first time

Oh, I won't break down tonight
I feel it for the first time
I feel it for the first time

I found a new place here
I'm coming down fast

I found a new place here
I'm coming down fast

I found a new place here
I'm coming down fast

I found a new place here
I'm coming down fast

F'd up, c'mon
F'd up, c'mon
