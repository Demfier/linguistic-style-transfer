It's so hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothing on me
And I can't take it no more
It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys
'Cause I gotta leave yeah
In the back of the cab
I tip the driver head of time
Give me there fast
I got your body on my mind
I want it bad
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high so high
Girl you're the one
I want you to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Girl you're the one
I want you to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you
You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear baby I'm yours
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high
So high so high
Girl you're the one
I want you to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Girl you're the one
I want you to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you
Just the thought of you gets me so high so high
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high so high
Girl you're the one
I want you to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Girl you're the one
I want you to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
I'll do anything
Just to get up next you
Anything is everything
Just to get up next you
Baby
Just to get up next you
Oh get up get up
