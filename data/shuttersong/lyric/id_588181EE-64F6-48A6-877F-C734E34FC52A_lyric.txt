Hands on your hips as we dig
Now I'm trying to steal a kiss from your lips
I can't quit
Love is in the air
It's not fair
When you moving
Diamonds in your hair
Catch the glare like a jewel in a flash of light
And it feels like I've been waiting all my life

But I need you tonight yeah
I don't wanna wait
You can say I'm dumber in love
Blame it on my age
Maybe because I'm young that's enough
I don't wanna miss this
I just need kiss kiss

Ooohh oohh

Oooo ooo ooo ooo oo

Sway to the music
Let's choose it
Don't you go away
Let the stay misbehave

Let your body go
With the flow of the moment

We can take a slow
With the motions, emotions are burning bright
And it feels like I've been waiting all my life
But I need you tonight yeah
I don't wanna wait
You can say I'm dummer in love
Blame it on my age
Maybe because I'm young that's enough
I don't wanna miss this
I just need kiss kiss

Ooohh oohh
Oooo ooo ooo ooo oo
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
And it feels like I've been waiting all my life
But I need you tonight yeah
I don't wanna wait
You can say I'm dummer in love
Blame it on my age

Maybe because I'm young that's enough
I don't wanna miss this
I just need kiss kiss
Oooh Ooh
I don't wanna wait
You can say I'm dummer in love
Blame it on my age
Maybe because I'm young that's enough
I don't wanna miss this
I just need kiss kiss
Oooh Oooh
Ooo Ooo Oo (Kiss Kiss)
Yeah
I just need a kiss kiss
