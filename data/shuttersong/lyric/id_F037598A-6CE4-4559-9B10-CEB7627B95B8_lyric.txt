Royals   White Noise (feat  Lorde & AlunaGeorge) (Live from the BRITs) - Disclosure
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn up town  no post code envy
But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room
We don't care  we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash
We don't care  we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us  we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule 
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this  we didn't come from money
But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room
We don't care  we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash
We don't care  we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us 
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule 
Let me live that fantasy
Let me live that fantasy
Let me live that fantasy
And we'll never be royals
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces  pieces of my heart 
Sometimes its fun  you pull my strings one by one 
Until you get me  get me  onto one 
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough 
Then let's play rough 
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough 
Then let's play rough 
I don't need you  giving it straight to me 
Giving it straight to me
Just gonna get my back 
I don't need you  telling me how to be 
Telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back 
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back  back  back
Back  back  back
Back  back 
Just noise  white noise 
Just noise  white noise 
I'm hearing static  you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying 
(Hear me crying)
