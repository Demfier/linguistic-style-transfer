I can show you the world.
Shining, shimmering, splendid.
Tell me princess,
now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes.
Take you wonder by wonder.
Over sideways and under,
on a magic carpet ride.
A whole new world.
A new fantastic point of view .
No one to tell us no, or where to go,
or say we're only dreaming.
A whole new world.
A dazzling place I never knew.
But when I'm way up here,
it's crystal clear.
That now I'm in a whole new world with you.

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers.
The heron and the otter are my friends.
And we are all connected to,
each other,
in a circle, in a hoop, that never ends.
Have you ever heard the wolf cry,
to the blue corn moon?
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?

The seaweed is always greener,
in somebody else's lake.
You think about going up there,
but that is a big mistake.
Just look at the world around you,
right here on the ocean floor.
Such wonderful things around you,
what more is you looking for?
Under the sea,
Under the sea.
Darling it's better,
down where it's wetter.
Take it from me.
Up on the shore they work all day,
out in the sun they slave away.
While we devoting full time to floating,
under the sea.

Ever just the same.
Ever a surprise.
Ever as before,
ever just as sure,
as the sun will rise.
Certain as the sun,
rising in the east.
Tale as old as time,
song as old as rhyme,
Beauty and The Beast.

'Till we find our place,
on the path unwinding,
in the circle,
the circle of life.
