Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
He's checking it twice

He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout

I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout

I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake

He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
You better watch out!
You better not cry

You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
