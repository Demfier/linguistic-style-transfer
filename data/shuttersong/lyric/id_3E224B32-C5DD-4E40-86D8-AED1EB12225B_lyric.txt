The parties where you're at then let me know

[Incomprehensible] don't be trippin' when you see us in the club
Just show a little love, represent your side like me
'Cuz round here if you slip you catch a hot on
Twelve shotgun, couple of 'em got one

Belvedere in the rear of the club, pulled up on dubs
And we 'bout two go and buy the bar up
So, so, for sure we ain't playin', hang with no lames+
If you bumpin' say it

A, where the party at?
Girl's on their way where that Bacardi at?
Bottles and models talkin' all of that
You know I can't forget about my thugs

(Where the party at?)
And all my girlz
(Where the party at?)
Off in the club

All the girlz in the club in their best outfit
Just showin' that skin tryin' to make a nigga wanna spit
Where you been girl? You and your friend
Need to come to the back where we got it locked down at

In your white T-shirt, or a three piece suit
Don't matter what you wear, all that matters is who you with
Some jiggy and some straight fly
All up in the club just to have a good time

Somewhere where it's crackin' right around one thirty
Never get stuck to early, comin' as is, hey, do-rags and tims
I'm rollin' fast in, hey, this little Jag and Benz

With the rose, not the one with the stem the one with the rims
The one that seem to make more enemies then friends
I'm slidin' in pass those, hoes
Both eyes close, both arms froze, both charms rolls

With the S O S O D E dot F
Buyin' bottles, bottles, until there ain't none left
I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no ref
I Jams mo' than Def baby show me the club

We in the V.I.P. twisted, down right spliffed
