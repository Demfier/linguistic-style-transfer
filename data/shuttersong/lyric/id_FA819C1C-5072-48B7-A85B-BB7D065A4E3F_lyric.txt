I ain't never a met a girl like you
And you'll never find a man like you
Walking out the door with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want
You got me going mad when you dress like that
Girl it's a trap when you act like that
I ain't even mad when you dress like that
I know you know you bad when you act like that
Oh yeah

Met a bad bitty from the state of Mississippi
Really pretty and I wanna take her home to see the city
Doing your thang got me insane
Walk in the mall and you cop me a chain
I was like damn you got as a flame
You mom is the only one that you can blame
You so cute girl yeah you is a blessing
And I'm the reason that your boyfriend keep flexing
Never stop texting every time i see your name up in my phone
I'm just picturing your body in that dress and make-up on
You don't even need the make-up, save that shit for later
You the baddest thing I seen I'm thanking your creator
Girl I see you working like Miley Cyrus be twerking
I'm certain you'll be screaming for me when I close the curtains
But it's funny 'cause I'm the one screaming out for you baby
I been messing around with too many girls I need a lady
Hoping you can be the one but you need to show it
And if you prove it to me all this money girl we'll blow

I ain't never a met a girl like you
And you'll never find a man like you
Walking out the door with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want
You got me going mad when you dress like that
Girl it's a trap when you act like that
I ain't even mad when you dress like that
I know you know you bad when you act like that
Oh yeah

Walked up in the spot we do this a lot
Living at the top, attention you caught mine
Let's pop a bottle good god, look at that we got
Double take like a stop sign
I thought I would be done with all of this stuff
But shit, I guess not
I'm tryina get ay you
Trust me I'm not your average individual
Yeah I can slow it down and I ain't talking about verses
I know what you're worth in my head
I've already bought you a purse and much more
And I got everything you need just like the drug store
Oh and before you ask, keeping haters off my nuts 
Yeah that's what the cuff's for
A bunch more, chances are coming your way
But I know that you'll take me
It's crazy how people get lost in love mixed up
I'm beginning to daydream of what we can be and things we can do
If you give me your time
But tonight all that's on my mind
Is getting to know you and making you mine
You're a dime, girl a straight ten
Like holy moly me oh my
I don't even know where to begin
And let's pretend that in this moment in time
We're more than friends
And I recommend that you and I get familiar

I ain't never a met a girl like you
And you'll never find a man like you
Walking out the door with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want
You got me going mad when you dress like that
Girl it's a trap when you act like that
I ain't even mad when you dress like that
I know you know you bad when you act like that
Oh yeah
