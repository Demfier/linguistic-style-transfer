I'm giving up, this whole lie is on me
Call it out like a family
Instead I bide my time, get a ride
Until the rubber leaves the road
You said donât lie so I made the truth
Seemed like a lie to even you
Control your fear, its clear
That you do not know where youâre going to
So donât you woo-oo-oo-oo-oorry
Youâll be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution
One month down and itâs in sight
Oh Iâm guaranteed to lose my mind
It's dangerous to speak and sigh
You might know what Iâm trying to hide
So from the cradle to quarter age
Oh I bought the book but didnât flip the page
Ohhhh, readiness is near, we steer-ah ah!
As far away from the coming of days
So donât you woo-oo-oo-oo-oorry
Youâll be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution

Whoo whoo whoooo
Turn around put it down and see
That this is really the place to be
Iâm not you, nor you me
But weâre both moving steady
