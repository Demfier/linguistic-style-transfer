Floating down through the clouds
memories come rushing up to meet me now.
in the space between the heavens
and the corner of some foreign field
I had a dream.
I had a dream.
good-bye Max.
good-bye ma.
after the service when you're walking slowly to the car
and the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
you hear the tolling bell
and touch the silk in your lapel
and as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
you take her frail hand
and hold on to the dream.

a place to stay
