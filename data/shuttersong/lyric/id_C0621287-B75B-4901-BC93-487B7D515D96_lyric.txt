I know you said
That you don't like it complicated
That we should try keep it simple
But love is never ever simple
No

Someday
You're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end

If we're never coming back down
Yeah we're looking down on the clouds

I know you said
That you don't like it complicated
That you are tired of all the changes
But love is always always changing
Woah

Someday
You're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end

If we're never coming back down
Yeah we're looking down on the clouds

And we go
And we go
And we go
And we don't stop

But we don't
No we don't
No we don't
Never go up

And we go
And we go
And we go
And we don't stop

But we don't
No we don't
No we don't
Never go up

Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end (Here we go again)
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends (Here we go again)
Another night stop will it ever end
Here we go again (Here we go again)
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end (Here we go again)
