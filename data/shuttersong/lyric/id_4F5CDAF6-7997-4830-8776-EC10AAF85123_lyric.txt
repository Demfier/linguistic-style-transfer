ohhhhh, I don't know what my life looks like without you by my side
I can't picture it inside my mind
You have been there for me, everything and everytime
My other half now left behind

Gotta go gotta move on
Do what I need to do
To get rid of every shred of you
Gotta go gotta move on
Do what I need to do
To start my life
Without missing you

I feel my wild heart
Beating loud inside my chest
I feel my wild heart
Can you feel my wild heart... beat

ohhhh, Images in my mind, new ones form instead
I breath in deep to clear my head
My life is waiting for me to get up and grab some move on
My other life now is gone, all gone

Gotta go gotta move on
Do what I need to do
To get rid of every shred of you
Gotta go gotta move on
Do what I need to do
To start my life
Without missing you

I feel my wild heart
Beating loud inside my chest
I feel my wild heart
Can you feel it beating
Excited to see what's waiting for me
Fresh new wild heart deep inside of me ohhh
Can you feel my wild heart ...beat

I feel my heart, I feel it deep inside of me
my wild heart beat, beating deep inside of me
I feel my heart, I feel it deep inside of me.
my wild heart beat, beating deep inside of me
I feel my heart, I feel it deep inside of me
my wild heart beat, beating deep inside of me
I feel my heart, I feel it deep inside of me.
my wild heart beat, beating deep inside of me

I feel it beating...

I feel my wild heart
Beating loud inside my chest
I feel my wild heart
Can you feel it beating
Excited to see what's waiting for me
Fresh new wild heart deep inside of me ohhh
Can you feel it beating
Excited to see what's waiting for me
Fresh new wild heart deep inside of me ohhh
Can you feel my wild heart...
