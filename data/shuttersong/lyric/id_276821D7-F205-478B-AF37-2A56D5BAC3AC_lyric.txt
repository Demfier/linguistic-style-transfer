I'm breakin' down gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry

I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

I'll never be that girl again
No uoooh
I'll never be that girl again
No uoooh

My innocence is wearin' thin but my
Heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh
Miss movin' on
Yeah

I broke the glass that surrounded me (surrounded me)
I ain't the way you remember me (remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more

I jumped the fence to the other side (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrified)
Now I'm no longer afraid
It's Independence Day (It's Independence Day)

I'll never be that girl again
No uoooh
I'll never be that girl again
No uoooh

My innocence is wearin' thin but my
Heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

Miss movin' on

Everything is changing and I never wanna go back to the way it was (to the way it was)
I'm finding who I am and who I am from here on out is gonna be enough (is gonna be enough)
Is gonna be enough

I'll never be that girl again
No uoooh
I'll never be that girl again
oh oh oooh
My innocence is wearin' thin but my
Heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh
Miss movin' on
(and on and on and on)
Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh
Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh
Yeah, I'm movin' on
