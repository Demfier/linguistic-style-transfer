I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me
I like girls I could never choose just one
That would ruin all the fun oh waho I like girls

bababum
Oh oh waho I like girls.

I like girls in the summer
Girls in the fall
Girls all year I wish I could have them all

Girls from other countries with crazy names
I love it when they tell me \
