I'm running out of time
I hope that I can save you somehow
If I, If I had superpowers
I'd save the world and you would be mine, mine

Have no fear, your hero is here
My super sense is tellin' me that danger is near
I'm gettin' close to you so I can watch yo' back
A villain's on the loose and he's ready to attack, oh!

But I'm not a superhero
I'm not that kinda guy
But I can save you baby, give me a try

Cause I'm runnin' out of time
I know what I came to do, and I didn't come to lose,
So I'll fight until you're mine
And if trouble comes around, I won't be backin' down, tonight

Ooooooooh, if you're in danger
Ooooooooh, I'm here to save ya
Ooooooooh, that's what I'm made of
Oh oh oh ooh, give you my SuperLuv

Been fightin' for your luv for all this time
What I gotta do to make you mine
Got no super speed, but I'm runnin' this town
If you get in my way, I'm a take you down

But I'm not a superhero
I'm not that kinda guy
But I can save you baby, give me a try.

Cause I'm runnin' out of time
I know what I came to do, and I didn't come to lose,
So I'll fight until you're mine
And if trouble comes around, I won't be backin' down, tonight

Ooooooooh, if you're in danger
Ooooooooh, I'm here to save ya
Ooooooooh, that's what I'm made of
Oh oh oh ooh, give you my SuperLuv

Can't you see
(That you're my lover)
We're meant to be
(You're like no other)
So come with me and say your mine
(Don't keep me waiting)

Cause I'm runnin' out of time
I know what I came to do, and didn't come to lose
So I'll fight until you're mine
And if trouble comes around, I won't be backin' down, tonight

Ooooooooh, if you're in danger
Ooooooooh, I'm here to save ya
Ooooooooh, that's what I'm made of
Oh oh oh ooh

Give you my Superluv And all you really need
Has been right in front of you this whole time
And I, I didn't need no super powers
I saved the world and now you are mine
Now you're mine
