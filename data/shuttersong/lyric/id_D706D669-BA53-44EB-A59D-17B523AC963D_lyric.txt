You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
You got the swag sauce, you dripping swag goo
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
You got the swag sauce, you dripping swag goo, ooh

I may be young but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
'cause we like to party

Your touch is driving me crazy,
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

So in love, I don't care what they say,
I don't care if they talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh oh
That I give you everything, music
knocking 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party

Set the scene, three thousand degrees
Ain't worried 'bout them
But they worry 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta
And another homeboy there named Cheese
with me, baby, I make it milk
'Til it drip down yo' knees
Spit this shit for rillo
Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me
This just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become
Someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court
Eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way
Every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom an' 'em, they never forgot
Nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't stunting to beat
Talking to me?
Girl, why you with me?
Move on, ain't nothing to see
Psst, always something to salt
I'm the raw off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them
Will remember the men
And that they fell in love with rap
Black like having your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

So in love, I'd give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh oh
That I give you everything, music knocking 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, we like to party

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
You got the swag sauce, you dripping swag goo
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
You got the swag sauce, you dripping swag goo, ooh
