I? m lookin' for a girl like you
(Well, here I go)

Now, now, now, who's the baby bomb?
It dip and dodgin', cryin', sobbin'
Lookin' to be mobbin' 'cause it's just clockin' and robbin'
Oh hi now, welcome to my town

The Illy I-town, you got kids liftin' eyebrows
Every time you fly down, so lie down
Full maxin', seein' you laughin'
With passion happenin'

Every action has a reaction
In fact you got my mackin' crackin'
I heard you're lackin' satisfaction from your other half
And honey, you? re packin' from the back

And the captain makes it happen
Pardon, what? s the matter?
He gots you shattered
Heard that your man is scattered

That mack was plastered
You're fine thing think
Look at me good ain't with that game and true
You make me wanna go, ooh

Like tin clan man, known for my slang bang
Don't be alone when my fangs hang
My love like bang bang, think I maintain

I need a diva like Aaliyah
Plush like a cleaner 850 Beamer, hot
Don't let me break her like I feed her
