You're the first face that I see
And the last thing I think about
You're the reason that I'm alive
You're what I can't live without
You're what I can't live without

And never give up
When I'm falling apart
Your arms are always open wide
And You're quick to forgive
When I make a mistake
You love me in the blink of an eye

I don't deserve Your love
But you give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
Take off running and come right after me
It's what You do

And I don't deserve You
You're the light inside my eyes
Give me a reason to keep trying
Give me more than I could dream
And You bring me to my knees

You bring me to my knees
Your heart is gold and how am I the one
That You've chosen to love
I still can't believe that You're right next to me

After all that I've done
I don't deserve Your love
But you give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
Take off running and come right after me
It's what You do
And I don't deserve You
