I hear you on the radio
You permeate in my screen
Its' unkind but
If I met you in a scissor fight
I'd cut off both your wings
On principle alone

Hey megalomaniac!
You're no Jesus!
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis!
Wash your hands clean of yourself, maniac
And step down, step down, step down!

If I were your appendages
I'd hold open your eyes
So you'd see
That all of us are heaven sent
And there was never meant
To be only one
To be only one

Hey megalomaniac!
You're no Jesus!
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis!
Wash your hands clean of yourself, maniac
And step down, step down, step down!

You're no Jesus
You're not Elvis
You're no Jesus
You're no Jesus
You're not Elvis
You're no answer

Step down! Step down! Step down!
Hey megalomaniac!
You're no Jesus!
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis!
Wash your hands clean of yourself, maniac
And step down, step down, step down!
