If you ever leave me baby,
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.

There's no one else that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
Oooh so keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
Will keep you by my side
Will keep you from walkin' out the door.

Cause there'll be no sunlight
if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
my eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it will rain
Rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Oooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin there he goes again
walkin' with that troublesome gitl

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Oooh but darlin' watch me change their minds
Yeah for you I'll try I'll try I'll try 
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'till I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

Cause there'll be no sunlight
if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it will rain
Rain, rain

Don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

Cause there'll be no sunlight
if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it will rain, rain, rain
