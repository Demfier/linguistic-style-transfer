And I'm not sure what this is all about
As we watch the waves crashing in and out
And only they know what we've found
And it almost feels like daytime now

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try to least anyway

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try

We decided to turn our world around
We can drive away from this loser town
Have to escape or go insane
A thousand miles an hour through the rain

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try to least anyway

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try

And we're not sure if we even know
Just where we are or where we're gonna go
But not afraid, not tonight
Gonna try all we can to get it right

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try to least anyway

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try to least anyway

Somehow we're gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well, I'll try

Well, I'll try
