As much as I love you
as much as I need you.
And i can't stand you
must everything you do
make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile?
Si tu me dejas, te enfadas
y despues me vuelves a besar

y eso me hace olvidar
(que estoy molesto)
y no me acuerdo de por qu√©
But I haaaate
you know exactly what to do
so that i can't stay mad at you

for too long
thats wrong...
Nadie me calma como tu
y me doy cuenta que mi unica verdad
es que odio amarte tanto
And I hate how much i love you boy
i cant stand how much i need you (te quiero)
and I hate how much i love you boy

but I just cant let you go

and i hate that i love you so
Tu sabes el poder que tienes sobre mi
nadie mas me hace reir...
Said its not fair
how you take advantage of the fact that i

will be under reason why
and it just aint right
Y es que odio amarte tanto amor
Saber que te necesito
Es que odio amarte tanto amor
no puedo vivir sin ti
pero odio quererte asi
One of these days maybe your magic wont affect me

and your kiss wont make me weak
Pero nadie, nadie mas
hoy me conoce tanto
Eso es un hechizo que tienes sobre mi
As much as I love you (te necesito)
as much as I need you (te quiero tanto)
As much as I love you (te necesito)
as much as I need you (te quiero tanto)
And I hate that I love you... So
And i hate how much i love you boy
i cant stand how much i need you (te necesito)
and i hate how much i love you boy
but i just cant let you go
and i hate that i love you so
and
i hate that I love you so... so...
