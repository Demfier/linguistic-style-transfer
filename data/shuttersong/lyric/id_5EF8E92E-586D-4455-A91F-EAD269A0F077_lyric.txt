Mistletoe - Justin Bieber\n It's the most beautiful time of the year\n Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer\n I should be playing in the winter snow\n But I'mma be under the mistletoe\n I don't wanna miss out on the holiday\n But I can't stop staring at your face\n I should be playing in the winter snow\n But I'mma be under the mistletoe\n With you shawty with you\n With you shawty with you\n With you under the mistletoe\n Everyone's gathering around the fire\n Chestnuts roasting like a hot July\n I should be chilling with my folks I know\n But I'mma be under the mistletoe\n Word on the street Santa's coming tonight\n Reindeer's flying through the sky so high\n I should be making a list I know\n But I'mma be under the mistletoe\n With you shawty with you\n With you shawty with you\n With you under the mistletoe\n With you shawty with you\n With you shawty with you\n With you under the mistletoe\n Aye love the wise men followed the star\n The way I followed my heart\n And it led me to a miracle\n Aye love don't you buy me nothing\n 'Cause I am feeling one thing your lips on my lips\n That's a merry merry Christmas\n It's the most beautiful time of the year\n Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer\n I should be playing in the winter snow\n But I'mma be under the mistletoe\n I don't wanna miss out on the holiday\n But I can't stop staring at your face\n I should be playing in the winter snow\n But I'mma be under the mistletoe\n With you shawty with you\n With you shawty with you\n With you under the mistletoe\n With you shawty with you\n With you shawty with you\n With you under the mistletoe under the mistletoe\n Kiss me underneath the mistletoe\n Show me baby that you love me so oh oh\n Oh oh ohhh\n Kiss me underneath the mistletoe\n Show me baby that you love me so oh oh\n Oh oh ohhh
