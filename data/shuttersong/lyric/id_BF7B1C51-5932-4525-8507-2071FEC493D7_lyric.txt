Battery - V.Rose
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
On my knees making a plea Lord I'm ready use me,
The people in the world need a way,
I tell 'em what you had me to say
And I'll keep my hands in the air!
Jesus your name, is power,
You're.. I put into u
I just want to be used,
I want to be electricity just for your sake!
I feel his energy, charging me like a battery,
Every time my hands go up, up, up
Every time my hands go up, up, up
I feel his energy, using me like a battery,
Every time my hands go up, up, up
Every time my hands go up, up, up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh where are them hands at,get them up high where them hands at,
If you know a Jesus stood in your place giving you grace,
Don't take it for granted
See, I cannot be purged,
When I'm feeling this surge,
And I'm feeling the urge, to go give them the word
Yes, I gotta rejoice cause with my voice I was screaming at chicks,
Rapping bout nothing and trying to get rich,
Looking at heaven and shaking my fist B(but uh)
I want the Lord to use me like I'm a tool like I'm Moses' rod,
Screaming give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus, Give my God,
Jesus your name, is power,
You're the outlet I plug into,
I just want to be used,
I want to be electricity just for your city
I feel his energy, charging me like a battery,
Every time my hands go up up, up up,
Every time my hands go up up, up up,
I feel his energy, using me like a battery,
Every time my hands go up up, up up,
Every time my hands go up up, up up,
Can you feel the power, when you say the name
Like turning the lights on, and all the darkness fades!
We don't deserve it, it's only by grace
It's only through faith that he uses me!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
I feel his energy, charging me like a battery,
Every time my hands go up up, up up
