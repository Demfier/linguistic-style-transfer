We made a fire
Went down in the flames
We've sailed the ocean
And drowned in the wave

Built a cathedral
But we never prayed
We had it all, yeah
And we walked away

Point of no returning
Now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you
But I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high
And now I'm falling
It's a long way down
It's a long way down

From Here
We had a mountain

But we took it for granted

We had a spaceship
But we couldn't land it
We've found an island
But we got stranded
We had it all, yeah
Who could've planned it?

Point of no returning
Now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you
But I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high
And now I'm falling

It's a long way down
(From Here)
Such a long way down
(From here)
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
