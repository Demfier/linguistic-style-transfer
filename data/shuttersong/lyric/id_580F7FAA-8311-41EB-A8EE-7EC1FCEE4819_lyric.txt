Where did the love go in your heart
Oh, you look so unhappy
I know that the last man broke your heart
No need to keep on crying
Why don't you just give me a try
See if I could make you happy
Oh, where did the love go
Where did the love go

And what's the point in sunshine
When all you feel is rain
What's the point in sunshine
When all you feel is pain

I SEE YOU, DARLING
Eyes looking like you had a fight with the rain
I, I SEE YOU, DARLING
Seems like every other day is the same, the same
The same, the same, the same
Like every day is the same, the same, the same
AND I SEE YOU CALLING
And you don't even know my name

Where did the love go in your heart
Oh, you look so unhappy
I know that the last man broke your heart
No need to keep on crying
Why don't you just give me a try
See if I could make you happy
Oh, where did the love go
Where did the love go

But I can see your heart to mine
To a million miles apart
I know it's gonna take a lot of time for you to find
But I'll meet you at the stars

I SEE YOU, DARLING
Eyes looking like you had a fight with the rain
I, I SEE YOU, DARLING
Seems like every other day is the same, the same
The same, the same, the same
Like every day is the same, the same, the same
AND I SEE YOU CALLING
And you don't even know my name

This could be the right time
Maybe this chance would never come again
Gotta tell you what's on my mind
Erase this with questions, oh, it all depends

I SEE YOU, DARLING
Eyes looking like you had a fight with the rain
I, I SEE YOU, DARLING
Seems like every other day is the same, the same
The same, the same, the same
Like every day is the same, the same, the same
AND I SEE YOU CALLING
And you don't even know my name
