You already know, you already know
I'm coming after you, so you better go
You're losing control, you're losing control
I can see the coldness inside your soul
I can feel it now, I'm holding it down
And if you try to stop me, you'll never know how
You already know, you already know
I can see the coldness inside your soul

So sick of the games that you're playing
I don't really get it, I just tune you out
You're talking like you know your information
You should be ashamed of your shade right now

I thought he would be so kind
You thought I would be so blind
You're crazy with your state of mind
You're crazy with your state of mind

You already know, you already know
I'm coming after you, so you better go
You're losing control, you're losing control
I can see the coldness inside your soul
I can feel it now, I'm holding it down
And if you try to stop me, you'll never know how
You already know, you already know
I can see the coldness inside your soul

Did you have to ruin what's created?
Once I get a chance, I'mma shut you down
Why you gotta be so pretentious?
You started from the bottom and you're here right now

I thought he would be so kind
You thought I would be so blind
You're crazy with your state of mind
You're crazy with your state of mind

You already know, you already know
I'm coming after you, so you better go
You're losing control, you're losing control
I can see the coldness inside your soul
I can feel it now, I'm holding it down
And if you try to stop me, you'll never know how
You already know, you already know
I can see the coldness inside your soul

I can see the coldness inside your soul
I can see the coldness inside your soul

You already know, you already know
I'm coming after you, so you better go
You're losing control, you're losing control
I can see the coldness inside your soul
I can feel it now, I'm holding it down
And if you try to stop me, you'll never know how
You already know, you already know
I can see the coldness inside your soul
