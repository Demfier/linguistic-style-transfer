Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine

Sweet sugar candyman

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one stop shop, makes my panties drop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman, ooh, yeah

He took me to the Spider Club on Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shut the paparazzi for a big surprise
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman, ohh yeah

Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth it really hit the spot
He had lips like sugarcane
Good things come for boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candyman, candyman
Sweet sugar candyman

He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, got me hot, making my ugh pop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby don't stop
Sweet sugar

He's got those lips like sugarcane
Good things come for boys who wait

He's a one stop shop with a real big ugh
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman
Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
Squared herself away and let out a yell
