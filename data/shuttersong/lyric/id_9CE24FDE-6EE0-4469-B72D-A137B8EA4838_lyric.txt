hiding notes in a secret place
i know it' so
close my eyes and i see airplanes
and so it goes
crossing number and counting days
for you to see
fingers move and anticipate
i skip a beat

hand me your eyes oversized
i can see through my disguise

I'm with you when i'm by myself
At least i feel like it's true
With a little help
and can you tell
My heart beats faster when you speak
And do you know
Heaven comes only for a week
And then it goes

hand me your eyes oversized
i can see through my disguise
Show me your mind hypnotize
Cover your mood
Heavy lies
