When life seems complicated
I'll find a place that's dark and quiet
Where the lights on the city aren't blinding
And the blackness will hide me
Arms open to the horizon
Don't wanna be alone like i've been
And the feeling is changed in the air
Is there anyone out there
Stars on fire
Moon is ignited
This is no ordinary sky
Above my lost days and dark nights
You're ultraviolet
This is no ordinary sky
Not tonight, not tonight (this is no ordinary sky)
Your eyes like diamonds
Now my universe is shining
I found you out there in the cosmos
I wanna hold you way up close
Stars on fire
Moon is ignited
This is no ordinary sky
Above my lost days and dark nights
You're ultraviolet
This is no ordinary sky
Not tonight, I'm not alone tonight
This is no ordinary sky
Not tonight
Wrapped into the silence
Beyond a lifetime
You and I
Stars and on fire
Moon is ignited
This is no ordinary sky
Above my lost day and dark nights
You're ultraviolet
This is no ordinary sky
Not tonight, not tonight
This is no ordinary sky
Not tonight
Stars on fire
Moon is ignited
This is no ordinary sky
Above my lost days and dark nights
You're ultraviolet
This is no ordinary sky
