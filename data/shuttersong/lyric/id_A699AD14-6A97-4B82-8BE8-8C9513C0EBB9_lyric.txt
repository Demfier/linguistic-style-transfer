Breathe in the air
I know it's hard to see past the urgency
the emergency
don't you let them rush you into something that you know is far away from you
I need the dark
my bloodshot eyes blur at my insanity
I have clarity
When they force my head to chain me up and leave me out to dry
bright lights change colours in the night
take my picture
change colours, colours
reach out to me
change the way I feel and make me come around
I'm not waiting for the lights to change, change colours, colours
change colours
I found a place
a place in my brain where I can be anything
I want everything
I have the power to control the myth that we all call our destiny
I won't rest in peace
Bright lights change the colours in the night
take my picture
change colours, colours
reach out to me
change the way I feel and make me come around
I'm not wating for the lights to change, change colours, colours
(change colours)
bright lights change colours in the night
take my picture
change colours, colours
reach out to me
change the way I feel and make me come around
I'm not waiting for the lights to change, change colours, colours
Bright lights change colours in the night
take my picture
change colours, colours
reach out to me
change the way I feel and make me come around
I'm not waiting for the lights to change, change colours, colours
change colours
