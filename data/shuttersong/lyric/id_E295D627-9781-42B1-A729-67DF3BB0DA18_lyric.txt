Talking to Ghosts - Foxes
Glitter falls on the souls through a saint
Love lies calm drowned in the way
'Cause you never really took it serious
Did you
No you never really took life serious
Did you
And I can't be your guide in life
You just left me
I can't be your guide in life
You have left me
If you have left me
Mark your love life still in the ground
Speak in silence have no sound
'Cause you never really took it serious did you
No you never really took life serious did you
I can't be your guide in life
You just left me
I can't be your guide in life
If you just left me
You just left me
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Open stars of dawn
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Open stars of dawn
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Talking to your ghost all day
Hoping in the same old way
Have you really gone have you really gone
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Have you really gone have you really gone
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Have you really gone have you really gone
Why does it judge when the optimists believed
Have you really gone have you really gone
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Have you really gone have you really gone
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Have you really gone have you really gone
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
Have you really gone have you really gone
Ah eh ah ah eh ah oh woah
