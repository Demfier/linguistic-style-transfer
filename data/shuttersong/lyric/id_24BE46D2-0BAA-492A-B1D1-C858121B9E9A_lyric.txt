For all the times that you rained in my parade
and all the clubs you get in using my name
you thing you broke my heart
oh girl, for godness sake
you think i'm crying, oh my oh
well, i ain't
and i didn't wanna write a song
cause I didn't wanna anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but, you still hit my phone up
And baby i've been moving on
And I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back
maybe you should know that
my mom don't like you and she likes everyone
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
And I've never like to admit that I was wrong
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that i'm still holding on to something
you should go and love yourself
Say you'll never let me go
Taking it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone
But then his hands roamed
I turned him to gold and it took him higher
Oh, I'll be your daydream
I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life
I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Cause if you like
Deep in my bones,
the way
I can feel you
Take me back to a time
you look that much
Only we knew hideaway
you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
