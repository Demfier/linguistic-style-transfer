She sees the world through TV screens
All of her friends in magazines
But every day she lives a broken dream, yeah
Making her own reality

There's lots of make up on her face
To cover up an empty space
But there's a lot behind those big blue eyes
She just don't realise

Everybody is gone and lost their mind
It's just the days we live in
Most of the time

Forget about the dark
Open up your eyes
You'll discover there's a world outside

To fix the broken heart you have to try
Pick it up, pick it up
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life
Beautiful life
It's a beautiful life

Beautiful life
He got his fortune on the plaid
But all that money won't chance fate, mmm
He's got six zero's but no one to share it with

No friends, no girl, no one in the world
Everybody is gone and lost their mind
It's just the days we live in
Most of the time

Forget about the dark
Open up your eyes
You'll discover there's a world outside

To fix the broken heart you have to try
Pick it up, pick it up
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life
Beautiful life
It's a beautiful life

Beautiful life
Beautiful life!
We are not so different you and I
Cause everybody's got a place to hide
But it's just the days we live in, days we living now, mmm

Most of the time
Forget about the dark
Open up your eyes
You'll discover there's a world outside
To fix the broken heart, you have to try
Pick it up, pick it up
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, and I-I-I
Beautiful lifeIt's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life!!
Beautiful Life
