When the crowd wants more I bring on the thunder
'Cause you got my back and I'm not going under
You're my point, you're my guard, you're the perfect chord
And I see our names together on every billboard

We're headed for the top
We got it on lock
We'll make 'em say hey!
'Cause there's no stoppin'
Us when we hit
The same but different
We're never gonna quit
And we'll keep rockin'

There's no way I could make it without ya
Do it without ya, be here without ya
It's no fun when your doin' it solo
With you it's like whoa!
Yeah and I know
I-I-I-I-I-own this dream
Cuz I-I-I-I-I-got you with me
There's no way I could make it without ya
Do it without ya, be here without ya

You got the skills and I'm bringing the fire
Your the fuel to my rocket and it's taking us higher
Yeah we got mad flow and we're blowin' it up
All our fans are gonna scream cuz they can't get enough

We're headed for the top
We got it on lock
We'll make 'em say hey
Cuz there's no stopping
Us when we hit
The same but different,
We're never gonna quit
And we'll keep rocking

There's no way I could make it without ya
Do it without ya, be here without ya
It's no fun when your doin' it solo
With you it's like whoa!
Yeah and I know
I-I-I-I-I-own this dream
Cuz I-I-I-I-I-got you with me
There's no way I could make it without ya
Do it without ya, be here without ya

Yeah Yeah Yeah I'll keep it rockin' with ya
Oh Oh Oh and there's no stoppin' us
Yeah Yeah Yeah I'll keep on rockin' with ya
K-keep on rockin'
We'll keep on rockin'

There's no way I could make it without ya
Do it without ya, be here without ya
It's no fun when your doin' it solo
With you it's like whoa
Yeah and I know
I own this dream
'Cause I got you with me
There's no way I could make it without ya
Do it without ya, be here without ya

Whoa

Be here without ya (out ya, out ya)
Be here without ya (out ya, out ya)
