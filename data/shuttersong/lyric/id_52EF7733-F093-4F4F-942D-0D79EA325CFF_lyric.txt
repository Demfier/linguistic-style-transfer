Please don't be afraid cause I got nothing to hide
I know I said I'll be there for you but something in your head was to know
It wasn't true

Said I need it, and now while you need me and I'll be

Please don't be afraid cause I got nothing to hide
I know I said I'll be there for you but something in your head was to know
It wasn't true
