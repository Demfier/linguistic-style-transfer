Capitol - TRUST
No love
Hold up  hold up  hold up
Afraid  a friend
Afraid  a friend
Set forth for the island
She went for the sky
Dropping the start
She didn't ask why
You're out on the road  man
You're flat on your back
It's going with the captive
When you spend like that
See me  see me
See me  see me
Come back  come back
Come back  come back
Set forth for the island
She went for the sky
Dropping the start
She didn't ask why
You're out on the road  man
You're flat on your back
It's going with the captive
When you spend like that
We need all the stairs now
We're staring at heights
We've gotta crack that
You didn't ask why
Time after time I start to forget
As long as I'm going
It's getting to get
Well  I got  well  I got
Well  I got  well  I got
