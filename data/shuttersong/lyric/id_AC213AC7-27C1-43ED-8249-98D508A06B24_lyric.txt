You're taking two Klonopin
So you can quit flipping
& face our friends
You dated the sainted dead
He ain't nothing but a prayer card
Tacked up with my record jackets
We're riding through Jackson Pines
Towards Six Flags to wait in lines
& have our spines shook
& I'm shook

Got the space sickness
While we wait on the weightlessness
The delirious kiss
& the feeling of falling in
Getting good at looking so in love
But our eyes are unfocused

We're right back in Manalapan
Those rainbows of oil spin
On your former street
Are we more than meat?
Not a goddamn thing we could have said
To convince you
Now I dream in color of your face
You have the coast in your mirrored shades
Only feel relief when I'm back at home
Falling forward alone

With the space sickness
While we wait on the weightlessness
The delirious kiss
& the feeling of falling in

There's nothing to do when
It's a foregone conclusion
The pool overflowing & bursting
Aw come the fuck on
I don't wanna die
At the hands of the Jackson whites
Let the warm air rush in
At the wreck up ahead
