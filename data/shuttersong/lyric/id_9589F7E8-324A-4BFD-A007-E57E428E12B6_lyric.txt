First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up and I can do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it is over
I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble

After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

Living for love
I'm living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm Living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up (up)
(Love, lift me up)

Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, lift me up)

I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best and it's not you
You've broken my heart
But you can't break me down

Had fallen apart, what was lost has now been found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to heaven and let me fall down

Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

Living for love
I'm living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm Living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up (love)
(Love, lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up...)
and love's gonna lift me up
Up, up, up, up
Love lift me
Up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up
Up, up, up, up
Love lift me

Up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up
(Gonna lift me up)
Love lift me
Up, up, up, up

Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, love, love)
