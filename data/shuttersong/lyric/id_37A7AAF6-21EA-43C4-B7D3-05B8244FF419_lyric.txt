(Verse 1)
There is power, power
Here in this hour, this hour
We're all together, together
Waiting here as one

There is power, power
Here in this hour, this hour
We're all together, together
Waiting here as one

(Chorus)
Whooaaa
Hear the sound from heaven
Whooaaa
A mighty rushing wind
Whooaaa
We're calling for revival
Got let your fire fall again
It's burning in my soul
Burning in my soul

(Verse 2)
All your sons and your daughters
Dreaming the dreams of their father
Seeing the signs and the wonders
The kingdom of God

(Chorus)
Whooaaa
Hear the sound from heaven
Whooaaa
A mighty rushing wind
Whooaaa
We're calling for revival
Got let your fire fall again
It's burning in my soul
Burning in my soul

(Bridge)
I cannot contain it this fire inside
I cannot contain it so let it shine
I cannot contain it this light of mine
It's burning in my soul

(Chorus)
Whooaaa
Hear the sound from heaven
Whooaaa
A mighty rushing wind
Whooaaa
We're calling for revival
Got let your fire fall again
It's burning in my soul
Burning in my soul
Burning in my soul
In my soul, in my soul

(Verse 1)
There is power, power
Here in this hour, this hour
We're all together, together
Waiting here as one

It's burning in my soul
It's burning in my soul
