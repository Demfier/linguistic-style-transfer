So you didn't show up
My heart didn't blow up
I ain't gonna lose it all tonight
No I'm not gon' fight it
Totally excited
Just to be here underneath the light

See my heart is going
BUM-BUM-DIDI-DIDI-PUM-PUM
Like a city never sleeps
And my head is going
BUM-BUM-DIDI-DIDI-PUM-PUM
Turn it up and blast the blast the beat

Dancing by myself 
I don't need no help 
Wishing you were here to see me 
Dancing by myself 
Got nobody else 
I don't really care believe me 
Just keep
