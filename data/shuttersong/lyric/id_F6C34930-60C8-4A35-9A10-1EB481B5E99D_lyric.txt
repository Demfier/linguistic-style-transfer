You said lets get out of this town,
drive out of the city, away from the crowds.
I though Heaven can't help me now,
nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down.
He's so tall, and handsome as hell.
He's so bad but he does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins,
my one condition is...
Say you'll remember me
standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your wildest dreams,
wildest dreams.
He said no one has to know what we do,
his hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room.
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever,
but this is getting good now.
He's so tall and handsome as hell.
He's so bad but he does it so well,
and when we've had our very last kiss,
my last request it is...
Say you'll remeber me,
standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again,
even if it's just in your wildest dreams,
wildest dreams.
He's seeing me in hindsight,
tangled up with you all night.
Burnin' it down.
Someday when you leave me,
I bet these memories follow you around.
He's seing me in hindsight,
tangled up with you all night.
Burnin' it down.
Someday when you leave me,
I bet these momories follow you around.
Say you'll remember me,
standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again,
even if it's just pretend.
Say you'll remember me,
standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again,
even if it's just in your wildest dreams,
Wildest dreams.
Say you'll remeber me,
standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again,
even if it's in your wildest dreams,
wildest dreams.
