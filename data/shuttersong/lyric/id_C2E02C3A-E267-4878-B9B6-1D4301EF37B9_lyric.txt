So I might
But would you like to take on me
Make an exception
When there's less to remain of me
So make an exception

Well it's the same thing
I cannot consider and maybe I'm chasing the night so I can find rough bones and bitter diamonds
Let it find you
I wanted the right so you gave me a fever in the measure of a kind
Rough stones and bitter diamonds

Shouldn't want you to need (It's you)
Shouldn't want you to need (It's you)
Shouldn't want you to need (It's you)
Shouldn't want you to need (It's you, it's you)
