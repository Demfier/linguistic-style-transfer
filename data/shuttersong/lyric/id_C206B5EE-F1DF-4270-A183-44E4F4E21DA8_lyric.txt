 When you fall for the wrong one
I love  you, I hate  you
It ain't cool, it's fucked up
Crazy how two people  fall in love with each other
Just to turn around and hurt  one another
It's fucked up
 You know how it go
 When  you  fall  for  the  wrong  one
 You may have been  the  wrong  one, but we met at  the right time
Late night dinner date, sipping white wine
After hours, downtown like we fight crime
 When  you with someone around  the clock, might find
That  you learn to depend  on each other
Then get sick of each other
Man, I miss how we used to be  when we were so damn into each other
Every day I discover, something new about  you
I put no  one above  you,  you would ask "round two?"
Laying down in  the covers
Body to body we sweating like  the middle of  the summer
Shit, I think I might love her
And  the butterflies, they don't lie, but  you sure do
Girl that's why, I'm internally conflicted deep inside
Looking  for  the right  one, always coming up dry
So I ask myself, why are  the girls that I fight with  the same  ones 
that I seem to fuck with  the most? (damn)
Emotions are drained,  the passion,  the pain, 
ain't got any more love to devote (nah)
I wish we could travel  the world, 
London to Spain, Dubai, I heard Dublin is dope
 You push me away then  you pull me in close
 You love me,  you hate me, I just wanna know (just wanna know)
(I just wanna know)
How could  you do me like that?
(I just wanna know)
I thought  you knew me better
(I just wanna know)
Than to do me like that, like that, like that
Cause  you know how it go
 When  you  fall  for  the  wrong  one
I love  you, I hate  you
It ain't cool, it's fucked up
Crazy how two people  fall in love with each other
Just to turn around and hurt  one another
It's fucked up
 You know how it go
 When  you  fall  for  the  wrong  one
Backstabbing was a daily habit
Girl, ain't it tragic how we thought we had it
All figured out, I guess time outlasted
Our will to love, these unburied hatchets are all we have
I can't imagine, that  the world's gonna stop spinning  on it's axis
And wait  for us to catch up, this whole situation's messed up
My heart's  on a rope and  you just kept tugging
Back and forth hoping I wouldn't get fed up, I got fed up
(Straight up)With  the accusations, I'm aching  for my next puff
Cause damn,  you got a young kid stressed out
Friend's telling me  you're getting around whenever I'm out of town
I can't seem to express how
That put a pit in my stomach,  when I gave  you my trust
Holding it down, I'm saying
Why are  the girls that I fight with  the same  ones 
that I seem to fuck with  the most? (damn)
Emotions are drained,  the passion,  the pain, 
ain't got any more love to devote (nah)
I wish we could travel  the world, 
London to Spain, Dubai, I heard Dublin is dope
 You push me away then  you pull me in close
 You love me,  you hate me, I just wanna know (just wanna know)
(I just wanna know)
How could  you do me like that
