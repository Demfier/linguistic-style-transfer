Spectrum (Say My Name) (Calvin Harris Remix Radio Edit) - Florence the Machine
When we first came here we were cold
And we were clear
With no colors in our skin we were light
And paper thin
And when we first came here we were cold
And we were clear
With no colors in our skin 'til
We let the spectrum in
Say my name and every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name as every color illuminates
We are shining and we will never be afraid again
Say my name as every color illuminates
We are shining and we will never be afraid again
And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms'
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms
And when it's time to pray
Dressed up all in gray
With metal on our tongues and silver in our lungs
Say my name and every color illuminates
We are shining and we will
Never be afraid again
Say my name as every color illuminates
We are shining and
We will never be afraid again
Say my name as every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
So say my name
And every color illuminates
And we are shining
And we'll never be afraid again
Say my name as
Every color illuminates
Say my name as
Every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name as
Every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
