Hurricane - Halsey\n There's a place way down in Bed Stuy\n Where a boy lives behind bricks\n He's got an eye for girls of eighteen\n And he turns them out like tricks\n I went down to a place in Bed Stuy\n A little liquor on my lips\n I let him climb inside my body\n And held him captive in my kiss\n And there's a storm you're starting now\n And there's a storm you're starting now\n And there's a storm you're starting\n I'm a wanderess\n I'm a one night stand\n Don't belong to no city\n Don't belong to no man\n I'm the violence in the pouring rain\n I'm a hurricane\n Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah\n I'm a hurricane\n Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah\n I'm a hurricane\n I went down to a place in Brooklyn\n Where you tripped on LSD\n And I found myself reminded\n To keep you far away from me\n And there's a storm you're starting now\n And there's a storm you're starting now\n And there's a storm you're starting\n I'm a wanderess\n I'm a one night stand\n Don't belong to no city\n Don't belong to no man\n I'm the violence in the pouring rain\n I'm a hurricane\n Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah\n I'm a hurricane\n Ha ah ah ha ah ah ah\n I'm a hurricane\n He says  Oh  baby  beggin' you to save me \n Well lately  I like 'em crazy\n Oh  maybe  you could devastate me\n Little lady  come and fade me\n I'm a wanderess\n I'm a one night stand\n Don't belong to no city\n Don't belong to no man\n I'm the violence in the pouring rain\n Come and fade me\n Come and fade me\n I'm a hurricane
