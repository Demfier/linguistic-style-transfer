 Christmas tree at  the 
 Christmas party hop
A mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
 Rockin'  around  the 
 Christmas  tree, let  the 
 Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly, deck  the halls with boughs of holly
 Rockin'  around  the 
 Christmas  tree, have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily in  the new old fashioned way
