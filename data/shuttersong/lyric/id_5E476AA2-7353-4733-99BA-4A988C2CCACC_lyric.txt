You may be moving at glacial paces
but you're not melting
wrapping your arms around all of the concrete
you love these buildings now

You have been left just a little shipwrecked
but you keep on floating
down to the docklands you're all out of options
you'll keep on hurting now

Find new love
find new love
dripping down your soul
find new love
find new love
dripping down your soul
dripping down your soul

You need perspective
it feels more effective
than what you're given
everyone tells you you're about to get better
your keep on giving up

Find new love
find new love
dripping down your soul
find new love
find new love
dripping down your soul
find new love
find new love
dripping down your soul
dripping down your soul
