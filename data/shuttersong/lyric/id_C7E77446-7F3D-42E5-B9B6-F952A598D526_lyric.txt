
 She has dreams to be an envy, so  she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
 She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What 's a little bit of hunger?"
"I could go a little while longer,"  she fades away
 She don't see her perfect,  she don't understand  she 's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
oh~
So  to all the girls that's hurting
Let me  be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have  to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars  to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
oh~
And you don't have  to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars  to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have  to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars  to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have  to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars  to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
