When the moon comes out tonight
When theres no stars in the sky
Will you please, will you please just let me go this time
Will you please, will you please leave me to die

Running from your love, running from your eyes
Running from heaven above, running from your lies
This pain I feel, this pain so real, pain you'll never know
I can't refrain, I can't obtain, I can't let go

I'm staying in the sky, gotta do what's right
I'm flying like a kite, the string is too tight, yeah
I'm losing it tonight, I want you to know
I just wanna go, baby, let me go

Take me away tonight, I don't want to feel your love
'Cause you know with you here it's a suicidal high
You know what they say, \
