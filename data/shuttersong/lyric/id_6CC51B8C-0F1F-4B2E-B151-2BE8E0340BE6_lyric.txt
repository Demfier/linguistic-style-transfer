Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch, just chilling in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh yes, I said it, I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Wooh-hoo, wooh-hoo, hooo
Nothing at all
Wooh-hoo, wooh-hoo, hooo

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl
Have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: \
