Yeah, I love to make love to you baby
(Yeah, make love tonight)

If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
Only got just one life this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say?
(Let's do it, do it, do it)

I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again

The way that you move boy is reason enough
That I love to make love to you baby

Oh I want you so much
Your lips taste like heaven
So why should I stop?
Yeah, I love to make love to you baby

Mr Worldwide, and the world's most beautiful woman

Modern day, Hhugh Hef (Uh, yes)
Playboy to the death (Uh, yes)
Is he really worldwide? (Uh, yes)
Mami let me open your treasure chest
Play dates, we play mates
I'm the king at snatching queens, checkmate
What you think?
It's a rumor?
I'm really out of this world,
Moon, luna
Make women comfortable
Call me bloomer
Can't even show love 'cause they'll sue ya
But I told them, ?Hallelujah, have a blessed day"
So ahead of myself
Everyday's yesterday
Want the recipe? It's real simple
Little bit of Voli, and she'll open Sesame

Now dance yes
Love next
Dance yes
Love next

If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
Only got just one life this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say?
(Let's do it, do it, do it)

I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
