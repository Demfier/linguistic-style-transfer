Wait, wait, I feel my heart change
Whenever you come around
The Earth shakes, it's more than I can take
I think my feet just left the ground

I know it feels like flying, I can't stop smilin'
You're the one I've been dreaming of
It's like happily ever after, nothing else matters

I guess that's falling in love
That's falling, that's falling
I guess that's falling in love
That's falling, that's falling

I guess that's falling in love
You, you, you're all I think about
Every minute of every day

It's true blue the way I feel for you
Your sweet love takes me away
I know it feels like flying, I can't stop smilin'

You're the one I've been dreaming of
It's like happily ever after, nothing else matters
I guess that's falling in love

That's falling, that's falling
I guess that's falling in love
That's falling, that's falling
I guess that's falling in love
I'm getting dizzy now
just like I'm spinning round
¡°
I guess that's falling in love

Could it be love?
I can't explain it, can't contain it
I don't want to at all
I'm ready to fall
I know it feels like flying, I can't stop smilin'
You're the one I've been dreaming of
It's like happily ever after and nothing else matters
I guess that's falling in love
That's falling, that's falling
I guess that's falling in love
That's falling, that's falling
I guess that's falling in love
