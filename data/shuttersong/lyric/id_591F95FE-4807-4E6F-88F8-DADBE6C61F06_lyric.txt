Patiently waiting for your return.
Dream of the day when you come back and take what's yours.
The Earth begins to shake as the trumpets sound.
Skyscrapers crashing down! 

When the trumpets begin to sound every knee will bow.
GLORY! GLORY! Skyscrapers crashing down, feet lifting off the ground.
GLORY! GLORY! 

The dead rise from their graves & begin to move.
My weary soul is restored.
I have been made new.

When the trumpets begin to sound every knee will bow.
GLORY! GLORY! Skyscrapers crashing down, feet lifting off the ground.
GLORY! GLORY! 

When the trumpets begin to sound every knee will bow.
GLORY! GLORY! Skyscrapers crashing down, feet lifting off the ground.
GLORY! GLORY! 

I can hear the Angels singing.
Your Kingdom come.
Your will be done.
Oh I hear the Angels singing.
O' Holy one, Your Kingdom come! 

When the trumpets begin to sound every knee will bow.
GLORY! GLORY! Skyscrapers crashing down, feet lifting off the ground.
GLORY! GLORY! 

When the trumpets begin to sound every knee will bow.
GLORY! GLORY! Skyscrapers crashing down, feet lifting off the ground.
GLORY! GLORY!
