Eh eh oh
Eh eh oh ooooh

I'm not leaving

Eh eh oh
Eh eh oh ooooh

Every time you say to me its over you just wanna start again

It's just lies

The girl who cries wolf every day
Ignored by gravity but in the end

Don't ask why

You say you wanna
But do you wanna

Run away a great escape
Oh yeah
Where you going

Always running

Find a way to call it quits again
So look at me in the eye

Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye

Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all

Cause I'm not leaving

Eh eh oh
Eh eh oh ooooh

Cause I'm not leaving
Eh eh oh

Eh eh oh ooooh

Does it have to be this tragedy this endless lost parade

A castle of facade of make believe
The truth is spelt out in your eyes why don't you just reach out
And make it clear to me

What are you telling me
You say you wanna

But do you wanna

Run away a great escape oh yeah
Where you going

Always running

Find somewhere to call it quits again
So look at me in the eye

Is anyone there at all

Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not leaving
(Cause I'm not leaving)
(Cause I'm not leaving)
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
is anyone there
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not dreaming
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there
Is anyone there at all
Look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
I'm not dreaming
Look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all
Is anyone there at all
Cause I'm not leaving
Eh eh oh
Eh eh ooooh
Eh eh oh
Eh eh ooooh
