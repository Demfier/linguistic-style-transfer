How you choose to express yourself?
It's all your own, and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, hmm, it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
You are the thunder and I am the lightning

And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally

Bay, bay, baby
You have a way of moving me

A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally (you know it does)
It comes naturally
Hmm, yeah
And it takes my breath away (everytime)

What you do, so naturally
You are the thunder and I am the lightning

And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally

Bay, bay, baby
When we collide, sparks fly

When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away
(You are!)

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay, bay, baby
Naturally, naturally, naturally
Everything, baby, comes naturally
Naturally, naturally, naturally
Bay, bay, baby
