Uh yea, oh yea
Trin' bein' I've got ya
Yea, I'm on that syzurp my
Ya off tha, hey, hey

Go by the name of Weezie F
An fuck 'em out the belly store with ten bags
Fly as a mutha fucka girly on my staple
'Cause her friends say I'm a tummy sucker

Don't go below the navel
I'm up in Lil' Hatti
I'm blowin' on Jamaica
I'm in the pimp a beemer
I'm with a salt shaker

Now I'm in Dave County
I see some thick bitches
I try to holla at 'em
But they all trick bitches

I think Trina sexy
Mama ya wine fine
And on the hush, hush
We need some quiet time

Yea, I'm a ridah ma
The Birdman's boy
He on cash money
All three on cash money
Yea, and I put her on cash money

She start wobblin' that ass for me
She start modelin'
She see the models in the Maybach
She call me Weezie F baby
And she make sure she say that

See a fly nigga baby yea, I don't trip
Just give 'em lil' die'
Mama give 'em lil' hip

And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Give 'em lil' die
Mama give 'em lil' hip
Then you give 'em Lil' Wayne
Give 'em a lil' nip

And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Now I'm the daughter of a madam
Inside of a pink phantom
If ya man got that cash
Then best believe I met him

'Cause I'm sharp as a machete
And I cuss like great'
Niggas call me Betty Crocker
'Cause my cakes stay plenty
Got stacks on top of stacks

No matter the consequence
My emphasis is to get it
It's Trina Weezie F baby
Man hand do the scripts

It's all reminiscent
To Gladys night in the pips'
All my niggas jump around
Girls jump on that dick

It ain't gonna be no standin' around
Now let's get crunk in this bitch
And ladies show 'em yo shit
A lil' hip, a lil' thigh

More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out
In my 850i or my big 600

Believe Trina done it
Believe them diamonds studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase grams 'cause I am what I am
Don't give a damn, go

See a fly nigga baby yea, I don't trip
Just give 'em lil' die'
Mama give 'em lil' hip

And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Give 'em lil' die
Mama give 'em lil' hip
Then you give 'em Lil' Wayne
Give 'em a lil' nip

And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Back to the lesson at hand
Stick to my plan
When it comes to seein' man after man

Don't give a damn about his car or his friends
Wh, wh, wh, what?
'Cause I'm gonna make my on ends
That's wh, what's up?

Ladies let's say you want a man
But don't know how to do it
Dirty dance with 'em
Put a lil' back into it

Look at yo wall shorty
End up at the mall sporty
Try to dog waddy'
Make 'em spend it all on ya
Yep and make that nigga ball for ya

Then have him beggin' for that kitty kat
Wining and dining for that ass
Give him none of that

Just let him know
Say make a bitch rich
'Cause the badest bitch taught you that

See a fly nigga baby yea, I don't trip
Just give 'em lil' die'
Mama give 'em lil' hip

And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Give 'em lil' die
Mama give 'em lil' hip
Then you give 'em Lil' Wayne
Give 'em a lil' nip

And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
