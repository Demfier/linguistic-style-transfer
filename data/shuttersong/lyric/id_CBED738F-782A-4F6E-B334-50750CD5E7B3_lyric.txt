I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)

I looked round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do (Thunder)
And I knew

There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)

Sound of the drums
Beatin' in my heart

The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been thunderstruck

Rolled down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the tone
Went through to Texas, yeah Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
An I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah the ladies were too kind
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah yeah yeah, thunderstruck
Oooh, thunderstruck
Yeah
Well I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
