I'd Love To Change The World - Jetta
Everywhere is freaks and hairies
Dykes and fairies tell me where is sanity
Tax the rich feed the poor
'Till there are no rich no more
I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you
Population keeps on breeding
Nation bleeding still more feeding economy
Life is funny skies are sunny
Bees make honey who needs money monopoly
I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you
But I don't know what to do
But I don't know what to do
But I don't know what to do
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you
And I don't know what to do
