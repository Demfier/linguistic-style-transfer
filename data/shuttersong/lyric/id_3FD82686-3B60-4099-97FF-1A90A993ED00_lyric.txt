Don't contradict me!
Don't disobey me!
Don't even think about going to that audition!
Please!?
No!
Mother!?
Stop...
Stop telling me what to do-o
Don't...
Don't treat me like a child of two-o
No...
I know that you want what's best
Please...
But mother please....give it a rest!
(3x)
Stop, don't, no!
Please...
Mama, I'm a big girl now!
Once upon a time when I was just a kid
You never let me do just what the older kids did
But lose that laundry list of what you won't allow
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now! (Oh, Tracy!)
Once upon a time I used to play with toys...
But now I'd rather play around with teenage boys
So if I get a hickey please don't, have a cow!
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now!
Ma, I gotta tell you that without a doubt
I got my best dancing lessons from yo-ou
You're the one who taught me how to twist and shout
Because you shout non-stop, and you're so twisted to-o
Ooh
Once I used to fidget cause I just sat home
But now I'm just like Gidget, and I gotta get to Rome
So say arrividicci, toodle-loo, and ciao!
'Cause mama I'm a big girl now!
Ooh
(3x)
Stop, don't, no!
Please...
Mama, I'm a big girl now!
Hey, mama....
Say, mama...
Once upon a time I was a shy young thing
Could barely walk and talk so much as dance and sing
But let me hit that stage I wanna take my bow...
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now!
Ooh!
Once upon a time I used to dress up Ken
But now that I'm a woman I like...bigger men
And I don't need a Barbie doll to show me how
'Cause mama I'm a big girl now!
Ooh
Ma, you always taught me what was right from wrong
And now I just wanna give it a try
Mama, I'm been innocent for far to long!
So please give a push and mama watch me fly!
Watch me fly!
One day I will meet a man you won't condemn
And we will have some kids and you can torture them
But let me be a star before I take that vow!
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now
Ooh
Mama, I'm a big girl now
Hey, ya, ya, ya, yay
Mama...I'm a big girl...
Ooh, such a big big girl
I'm a big girl...now...ooh(2x)
(Stop, don't, no, please)
Mama, I'm a big girl now!
