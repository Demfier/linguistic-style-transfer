I do not know
Why I would go
In front of you
And hide my soul
Cause you're the only one who knows it
Yeah you're the only one who knows it

And I will hide behind my pride
D-don't know why I think I can lie
Cause there's a screen on my che-est

Yeah there's a screen on my che-est

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
I'm standing in front of you
Oh I'm standing in front of you

I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I can't see past my own nose
I'm seeing everything in slow-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground
Just like a vertical loco-motive that's a train
Am I painting the picture that's in my brain
A train from the sky locomotive my motives are insane
My flows not great
Okay
I conversate with people who know if I flow
When my song got no radio play
While you're doing fine
There's some people and I
Who have a really tough time

Getting through this life
So excuse us
While we sing to the sky

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I'm standing in front of you
Oh I'm standing in front of you

Oh I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ohh

We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people
We're broken people
Yeah
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people
We're broken people
Yeah

We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people
We're broken people
Yeah

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
I'm standing in front of you
Oh I'm standing in front of you
Oh I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
