Oh love, love is a feeling that you fear
But if you open up, know I won't let you fall my dear
Under the surface we're all just the same
Follow me darling, for you I'll be brave
Oh love, love is a feeling that you fear

Take your time
I'll be here waiting for you

I won't let you go when your world's in the dark
You can keep borrowing my heart
Even your fear won't keep us apart
You can keep borrowing my heart
Take it or leave it, it's yours to decide
Break it or keep it, you're safe
And I won't let you go when your worlds in the dark
You can keep borrowing
Borrowing my heart

Love, when will you lend yourself to me?
Oh if you give it up
I promise I'll return it to you safely

But under the surface we're all just the same
Follow me darling, for you I'll be brave
Oh love, when will you lend yourself to me?

Take your time
I'll be here waiting for you

I won't let you go when your worlds in the dark
You can keep borrowing my heart
Even your fear won't keep us apart
You can keep borrowing my heart
Take it or leave it, it's yours to decide
Break it or keep it, you're safe
And I won't let you go when your worlds in the dark
You can keep borrowing
Borrowing my heart

You can just borrow my heart, now you can't just borrow my heart, I won't let you go when your worlds in the dark
You can keep borrowing my heart

I won't let you go when your worlds in the dark
You can keep borrowing my heart
Even your fear won't keep us apart
You can keep borrowing my heart
Take it or leave it, it's yours to decide
Break it or keep it, you're safe
And I won't let you go when your worlds in the dark
You can keep borrowing
Borrowing my heart
