Boys…
Breathe in fear
Change the wind
Heaven/ever near
…hazy eyes
Breathe a little deeper and…
Come on sit down next to me

Gotta get some healing
Gotta keep on moving
Gotta get together
And use this time
Gotta live faster
Gotta laugh harder
Gotta find each other
And use this time

Don’t touch the words
Not a word I say
Live life for the next one, you get what came
…wish…
In the end it’s only you left alone in the dark
Come on sit down next to me

I don’t want to spoil the time/fun
But behind these eyes I’ve really got no one
Been saying to myself just between you and me
