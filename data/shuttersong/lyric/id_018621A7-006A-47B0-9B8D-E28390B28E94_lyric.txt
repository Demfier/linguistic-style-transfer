Take my hand I'll show you where we play
Where rules are bent
This is our getaway

We're screaming yeah
The future is now go 'head and get loud

We're screaming yeah
The new kids around
'Cause this is our town (our town our town)

Welcome to the bottom of the map
Where we young and we hungry
These kids don't play
And I rap that city that I come from
A-T-L I was born and raised
And I talk that talk 'Cause I walk that walk
I was taught to work hard - get paid
Spit balling freestyles on the playground
Blowing up make mad girls look my way
So eh
What you know 'bout a young man with a plan
To make a new way through
Breaking every obstacle down to his waist
Still breaking records and doing it at a new pace
Can't touch what you can't see
But it's new kids we be that freshman class
But it's coming backwards
'Cause I'm teaching half of these headmasters new thing!
Never extra credit
If I wanted them I'd get on the mic and get it
But I read that inpirational sign on the back that says
'Sky's the limit'
School's now in session
For your first lesson: Talk is cheap
Better put that pen to the pad
And scribble out your thoughts 'till your fingers bleed.

Take my hand I'll show you where we play
Where rules are bent
This is our getaway

We're screaming yeah
The future is now go 'head and get loud

We're screaming yeah
The new kids around
'Cause this is our town (our town our town)

This is what I live for
Fight for
Rap these songs I write for
We get loved and criticized for
But I'm gonna keep looking at my title
'Cause ain't nobody can say
That you can never have heart and be great
Keep believing
Work hard every day
'Cause you dream, and get far, graduate
We get a vision in our head and we run away
To a place where we're safe, and we can create
With no time for any haters
Take away time from what we trying to do
Keep your head straight
'Cause you can do it if you put your mind to it
And never let another belittle what you're doing
When nobody else is around because
You think you're up but you're on your way to winning but you Keep critiquing your beautiful sound
We the new kids that freshman class
Them prospects with attitude
We're world changers, earthshakers
You don't understand the magnitude
We're billions, brilliant
We're technology on the cutting edge
And we're coming at you full steam ahead
But I'm looking back at you, my arms stretched like

Take my hand I'll show you where we play
Where rules are bent
This is our getaway

We're screaming yeah
The future is now go 'head and get loud

We're screaming yeah
The new kids around
'Cause this is our town (our town our town)

Yeah

MB

Let it run
