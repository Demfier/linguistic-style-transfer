Caught up in the whirlwind
I'm just a dragon flying
And my wings ain't helping me, yeah

I'm in a little trouble
Sure didn't see this coming tonight
Have no clue what I'm gonna do now

And ask me who's put me in this twist
Ask me who's responsible for this

She is, everything's all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind
No one can help me
Ask me who's responsible for this

She is, everything's all her fault
So now I'm in love and I didn't want to be
And all because of she, and all because of she

Days ain't long enough
Nights are even shorter, this ain't fair
Time don't wanna give me what I need
All I'm asking is forever

Forever and a moment
Listen to me, this ain't how I talk
I don't know what she done to me
But I like it

And ask me who's put me in this twist
Ask me who's responsible for this

She is, everything's all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind
No one can help me
Ask me who's responsible for this

She is, everything's all her fault
And now I'm in love and I didn't want to be
And all because of she, and all because of she

Said it's getting hard for me to picture me without you
With every passing day baby
But it's easy to answer who's the owner of my heart
Simply look at you and say she is

Everything's all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind
No one can help me
Ask me who's responsible for this

She is, said everything's all her fault
And now I'm in love and I didn't want to be
And all because of she, and all because of she
And all because of she, and all because of she
