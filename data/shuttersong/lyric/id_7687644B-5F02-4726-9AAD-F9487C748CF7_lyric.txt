Everybody's laughin in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
Cuz baby I didn't

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'till you believe
That that should be me
That should be me
Said you needed a little time from my mistakes

It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me?
Your taking him where we used to go
Now if your trying to break my heart
It's workin', cuz you know
That should be me, holdin' your hand

That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'till you believe
That that should be me
I need to know should I fight for love

Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
This pain in my heart
That should be me, holdin' your hand

That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
