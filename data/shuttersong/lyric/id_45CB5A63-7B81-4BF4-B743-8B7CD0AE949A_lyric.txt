The five days we were friends
Now shine
Like a winter break
The near connection
The sheer affection
I would not intimate

I wouldn't dare

The skin you came
By back in junior high
Though it had its day
Stands in bold relief
To your misfit grief
We are the same that way

At the IHOP
You looked like an angel

And I looked like a john

The patrons there could not disguise
The thoughts behind their brittle eyes
You took no notice
And that makes me wish
I could have a sixth
Now is that so hopeless

And I miss you, hon

So we sat us down a while
And we tried to reconcile
All the hopes and fears
The peaks and lulls
The obstacles
That shape the coming years

And all the things I know for sure
Like that I never will be yours
That inconvenient fact
Or that your intuition's wrong
And you never will be wrong
We are the same like that

And I miss you, hon

God damn the rumors that bastardized
Our first hellos and last goodbyes
The bookends
To the five books on the nightstand
Our platonic five-night stand
Weren't we just good friends

And I miss you, hon

Why is it so hard to believe
That someone else could see
You are the things you hope you are
You're all the things you hope you are
You're everything you hope you are

And I miss you, hon
