When this began
I had nothing to say
And Id get lost in the nothingness inside of me
I was confused
And Id let it all out to find
That im not the only person with these things in mind
Inside of me
When all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that Ive got left to feel
Nothing to loose
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own

I wanna heal I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
Erase all the pain till its gone

I wanna heal I wanna feel
Like Im close to something real
I wanna find something Ive wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And Ive got nothing to say
I cant believe I didnt fall right down on my face
I was confused
Looking everwhere only to find
That its not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
So what am I
What do I have but negativity
Cause I cant justify the way everyone is looking at me
Nothing to loose
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own

I wanna heal I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
Erase all the pain till its gone

I wanna heal I wanna feel
Like Im close to something real
I wanna find something Ive wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know
Myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel
Anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything
Until I break away from me
I will break away
I'll find myself today

I wanna heal I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long
Erase all the pain till its gone

I wanna heal I wanna feel
Like Im close to something real
I wanna find something Ive wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal I wanna feel I wanna feel like Im
somewhere I belong
I wanna heal I wanna feel I wanna feel like Im
somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong
