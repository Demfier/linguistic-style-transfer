At forty-four minutes til four
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
There's no slowing down
As the globe spins 'round and 'round
You gotta keep going, gotta keep going
Gotta keep going, you gotta keep going
Gotta keep going, you gotta keep going
You gotta keep going, you gotta keep going
You gotta keep going

If there's one thing that I learned
While in those county lines
Is that everything takes time
You have gotta lose your pride
You have gotta lose your mind
Just to find your peace of mind
You have got to trust the signs
Everything will turn out fine

So why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when, your caught in the whirl wind
Lost in the whirl wind, your chasing the wind
You gotta understand
There's,
There's really no end, there's really no beginning
There's really no real, there's really no pretending
There's really no fail, there's really no winning
Cause nothing really isn't, everything really isn't

At forty-four minutes til four
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
That life only gets harder but you gotta get stronger
This here's for my brother, I do this for my daughter
That's why I keep going, that's why I keep going
That's why I keep going
That's why I keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going, gotta keep going
Gotta keep going

I gotta show them, that I could keep going
I gotta keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going

Why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when, your caught in the whirl wind
Lost in the whirl wind, your chasing the wind
You gotta understand
There's,
There's really no end, there's really no beginning
There's really no real, there's really no pretending
There's really no fail, there's really no winning
Cause nothing really isn't, everything really isn't
That's why I keep going
