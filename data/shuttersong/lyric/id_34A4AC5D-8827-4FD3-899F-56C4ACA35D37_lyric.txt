(2): You're a troublemaker, troublemaker
You aint nothing but a troublemaker girl
(1): You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down

The way you bite your lip got my head spinnin' around
After a drink or two I was putty in your hands
I don't know if I have the strength to stand
Oh-oh-oh
Trouble troublemaker yeah that's your middlename
Oh-oh-oh
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain

And I wanna know

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
Woah-oh-oh
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can

I say I'm done but then pull me back
Woah-oh-oh

I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker

It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours

Cos I keep comin' back again for more
Oh-oh-oh

Cos I keep doing the same damn thing
Think one day we gonna change
But you know just how to work that back
And make me forget my name
What the hell you do I won't remember
I'll be gone until November
And you'll show up again next summer (yeah)
Typical, middle name is Prada
Fit you like a glove girl I'm sick of the drama
You're a troublemaker
But damn girl it's like I love the trouble
