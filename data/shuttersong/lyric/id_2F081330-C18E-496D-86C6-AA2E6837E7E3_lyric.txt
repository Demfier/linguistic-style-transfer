Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Kitty and Blaine:]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

[Sam:]
And anytime you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

[Sam with New Directions:]
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

[Blaine (New Directions):]
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her (Let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart

[Blaine with New Directions:]
Then you can start to make it better

[Sam and Tina:]
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

[Sam with New Directions:]
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

[Sam:]
Yeah

[Sam and Kitty (Blaine):]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better
Better better better better better (Oh, yeah, yeah, Jude!) 
([Kitty:] Ooh!) (Aww! Ooh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
