What a bad chick, She wants to flaunt it
Got that look in her eyes
She wants own this
What a grown chick
Beautiful lips, Dippin' & Slidin'
She wants to roll them hips
She wants to drop them hips
Take it low, Even cab drivers pay her tolls

She's got it all in a handbag
Don't need a man to make it home
She's superwoman, Without a cape
Makes all her money, Won't call it cake
And ain't no one gon' call her fake
Won't stress that, Call her own fate
Independent chick, You can bet that
Got her own whip, You can check that
Matter fact, You can be the valet
And go and park it out back
With the rest of the best, And she'll stop it dip
Make the guys all slip
Into a grown love, She can own love
Don't have to say that she's on
What a bad chick
She wants to flaunt it
Got that look in her eyes, She wants to own this
What a grown chick
Beautiful Lips, Dippin' & Slidin'
She wants to roll them hips

Dippin' & Slidin', She wants to roll them hips

Take it low, Got her own class
So take a note, She can move fast
Or take it slow, It's up to her
Captain of the boat
Does her own thing, Leader of the team
Knows what to taunt, To make heads lean
On the dance floor, Like a movie scene
Moving round & round
Carousel queen, And she'll stop it dip

Make the guys all slip, Yeah she'll stop it dip
Make the guys all slip

Yeah yeah she'll stop it dip, Make the guys all slip

Into a grown love
She can own love

Don't have to say that she's on

Oh

Way you talk your lips just glow

Moving side to side oh
Will you pose for me or no?
All the way down down

Down down
All the way down down

Down down
I just I just I just
What a bad chick
