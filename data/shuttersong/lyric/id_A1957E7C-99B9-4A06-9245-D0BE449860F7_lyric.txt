I wanted to tell you, it's not by virtue of some obligation
I'm trying to see you, I think that I hurt you
I kissed her, you kissed him too

Let me speak to you
So I can show you
All I want is to sort this out
And this really won't do, no, no...

I'm gauging this feeling
Always misleading
It's hard to know what's true

You pocket call me, from some party
There were so many voices in that room

Let me speak to you
So I can show you
All I want is to sort this out
And this really won't do, no, no...

It's you I see in everything
It's you I see in everything

Let me speak to you
So I can show you
All I want is to sort this out
And this really won't do, no, no...

Still thinking of you

And let me speak to you
So I can show you
All I want is to sort this out
And this really won't do, no, no...
