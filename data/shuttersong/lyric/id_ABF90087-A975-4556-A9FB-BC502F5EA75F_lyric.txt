Selfish Girls - Jake Miller\n I was gonna write you a love song just the other day\n So I sat down and thought real hard but nothing ever came\n I took a walk downtown and it hit me like a train\n So I grabbed a napkin and started scribbling away\n And I was like woah-oh woah-oh\n Sexy can't make up for crazy no-oh no-oh\n And girl you crazy as shit\n This song's for selfish girls\n They want the whole wide world\n They just want everything\n We just want everything\n And they cry when the sky ain't blue\n This song's for selfish girls\n They want the whole wide world\n I give them everything\n And there ain't nothing I can do\n Look she walked into my life all innocent and shit\n And then she took my credit card and dipped\n Gave me a kiss then turned around and stole the keys to my whip\n Aw man what a selfish bitch\n She was like See ya I wouldn't wanna be ya\n Kidnapped my Visa then she hit the galleria\n Let's have a moment of silence for what I say next\n All RIP to all my paychecks\n Supermodel but the inside's ugly\n Yeah and I'm over it like a fraction\n She loved herself way more than she loved me\n Only cared about her Instagram captions\n So this the last song I'm ever gonna write for ya\n Go find a douchebag maybe he'll be right for ya\n And if you wonder why your phone ain't ringing\n Call my voicemail and I'mma start singing\n This song's for selfish girls\n They want the whole wide world\n They just want everything\n We just want everything\n And they cry when the sky ain't blue\n This song's for selfish girls\n They want the whole wide world\n I give them everything\n And there ain't nothing I can do\n La la la la la la la\n La la la la\n La la la la la la la\n La la la\n I thought you were a dime but you loved me for my dimes\n Selfish girls will be the death of me this happens every time\n I thought you were a dime but you loved me for my dimes\n Selfish girls will be the death of me this happens every time\n And I was like woah-oh woah-oh\n Sexy can't make up for crazy no-oh no-oh\n And girl oh my God\n This song's for selfish girls\n They want the whole wide world\n They just want everything\n We just want everything\n And they cry when the sky ain't blue\n This song's for selfish girls\n They want the whole wide world\n I give them everything\n And there ain't nothing I can do\n Selfish girls
