You got that crazy look from your mother
One glance is all it took
And every single day is like no other
I don't care what you say
I don't care what you do
Drop it down and take it on the road
It's called anew
Stolen time and stolen places
Beats and rhymes and always ?
You gotta go for it all
Or not go together
I don't care what you say
I don't care what you do
Drop it down and take it on the road
It's called anew
(mumbles)
I don't care what you say
I don't care what you do
Drop it down and take it on the road
It's called anew
