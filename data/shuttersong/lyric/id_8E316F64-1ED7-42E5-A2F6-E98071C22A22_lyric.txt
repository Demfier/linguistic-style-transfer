Baby baby, you ain't gotta rush
Shouldn't have to work this hard for love
I see the way you hurts and you ain't even certain
Putting on smile, baby girl don't front
And you deserve better, I can love you better
I can put the sunshine back in your weather
We can go places you never been before
What you waitin for? Pack your bags and walk out that door

(Bridge)
I know you've been broken and you're holdin back
But I'll be right there for you and you should know that
And I don't wanna see you shed any tears
‘Cause baby for now you know I'll be right here

()
I can love you better
You can count on me for whatever
I'll be sure to make you smile
Go that extra mile
I'mma keep you dancing, make it all worth while
I can love you better
You can count on me for whatever
I just wanna be your lover, I don't want no other
Soon as I'm around, your body gon discover
I can love you better
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I can love you better
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Baby baby, you ain't gotta lie
I can see the truth starin in your eyes
You ain't gotta worry babe, you ain't gotta try
You're too beautiful to hurt inside
I can your soldier, I can be your knight
Put you on my shoulder, fight for your life
You can go places you never been before
So what you waitin for? Pack your bags and walk out that door

(Bridge)
I know you've been broken and you're holdin back

Oh yea, I will do what it takes
To let nobody ever hurt you
‘Cause can nobody love you like I can love you

(Interlude)
