 Only been missing my lover
.
Got a whole lot of texts in  my phone and I don't reply
But the next day bothers you, I
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, ain't worry about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
.
Yeah, yeah, what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
.
Take the keys out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by  my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and  only you
Uh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the  only girl I see
From the bottom of  my heart please believe
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, ain't worry about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
.
Yeah, yeah, what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
