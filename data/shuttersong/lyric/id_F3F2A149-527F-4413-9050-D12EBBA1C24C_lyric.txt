Your love is so true

I never thought that

I would find you

So sweet, so fine¡­ sunshine

You¡¯re so much more to me than

I ever dreamed that could be possible

In This life

And when you touch me

It¡¯s more that just a feeling

It¡¯s love¡­

It¡¯s love¡­

So lovely

This dream that we share

I hope you know

I want you always there

To have, to hold¡­ pure gold

Look I need to explain myself

Let you know right now exactly how

I¡¯m feeling
