Hello, my goodness
I didn't know I was here
Do you know my name? (Can't go wrong when you try)
Always got to try
No matter how long that shit take
Yeah, yeah
Uh
Whatever stops you from dreamin'
Whatever tries to stop you from livin'
Flip it

Welcome home
Cause right now what I have to do is
I gotta amp myself up as well as you
So, yeah, so what it took me like
Maybe two years and shit
But I'm feelin' prepared
You know what I'm sayin
And I'm feelin' a little more ready for the world
And less loss
As I once was

So come on
What chu waitin' on?
Feel me, feel me, feel me
What, uh, yeah
What, uh, yeah
What?
