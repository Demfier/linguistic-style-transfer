What an amazing time, what a family
How did the years go by? Now it's only me

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick, ooh

Like a cat in heat, stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find a brake
What if they say that you're a climber?
Naturally, I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares 'cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow, oh, oh oh

What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting for?

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick
Take a chance, you stupid hoe

Like an echo pedal you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart
Why are you standing in one place?

I know it's so messed up, how our society all thinks
Life is short, you're capable, oh, oh oh

Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female!
You've got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track

What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting for?

I can't wait to go back into Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo, your Harajuku girls
Damn you've got some wicked style... Go!

Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female!
You've got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track

What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting for?

What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
Take a chance, you stupid hoe, ooh ooh oooh
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
Take a chance, you're capable
