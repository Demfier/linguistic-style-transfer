Me with the floor show, kickin' with your torso
Boys getting high and the girls even more so
Wave your hands if you're not with the man
Can I kick it?
(Yes, you can!)

I got (funk)
You got (soul)
We got everybody
I've got the gift
Gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body!

Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness?
Every girl every man
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground-control can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Singin' in the classes, music for your masses
Give no head, no backstage passes
Have a proper giggle, I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mike, I rock the mike (right)

You got no love then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl, but your best friend can
It's time to move your body!

I don't wanna be sleazy, baby just tease me
Got no family planned
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground-control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Pimpin' ain't easy
Most of them fleece me every night
Pimpin' ain't easy
But if you're sellin' it, it's alright
Come on

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna to stop DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
