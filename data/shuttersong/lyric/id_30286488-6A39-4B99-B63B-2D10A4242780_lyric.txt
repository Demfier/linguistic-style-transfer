Frosty the snowman
Was a happy jolly soul
With a corncub pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal.

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
How he came to life that day.

There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.

For Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me.

(Interlude)

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler \
