A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly
And he's also known as a buster
Always talkin' about what he wants

And just sits on his broke ass, so
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere

No, don't want none of your time
I don't want no scrubs
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side

Of his best friend's ride
Try to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side

Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me, trying to holla at me, at me.
But a scrub's checkin' me and his game is kinda weak
And I know that he gonna approach me
Cause i'm lookin like class and he's looking like trash

Can't get with no deadbeat ass, so
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine, and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere

No, don't want none of your time
No, i don't want no scrubs
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side

Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side

Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me, holla at me
holla at me, holla at me.
If you don't have a car and you're walkin'
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma

We're all in our private traps
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrubs, no scrubs
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps
No scrubs, no scrubs

I was born in mine; I don't mind it anymore
No scrubs, no scrubs
Oh but you should, you should mind it
No scrubs, no scrubs
I do, but I say I don't
No, I don't want no scrub
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me, try to holla at me
Holla at me, try to holla at me.
