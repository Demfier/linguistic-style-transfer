Oh darling I
Know you're taken
Something ‘bout this
Just don't feel right
Every time
One of us, tries to leave here
Oh the other one
Holds on tight

Oh oh

Baby tonight
There's so much love in between us
But you say you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

You tell me someone's
Waiting for you
That you can't do this anymore
But you kiss me again
So go ahead and
Draw the blinds and
Lock all the doors

Baby tonight
There's so much love in between us
You say you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

Oh if you want me
Like I want you
I won't judge you
This could be our little secret
Our secret
So tell me if you're ready
‘Cause if no one knows then
It ain't really cheating, cheating yeah
Oh darling
I know you're taken
But something ‘bout this
Just feels so right
Oh baby
‘cause every time
One of us, tries to justify the situation
We just hold on tighter

Oh oh
Baby tonight
There's so much love in between us
But you say that you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul
