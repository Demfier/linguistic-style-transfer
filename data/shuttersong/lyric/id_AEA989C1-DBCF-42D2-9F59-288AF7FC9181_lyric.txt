Best Thing I Never Had - Beyonc¨¦
What goes around comes back around  hey my baby
What goes around comes back around  hey my baby
What goes around comes back around  hey my baby
What goes around comes back around
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right 
No lies  no wrong 
Boy  I must've been out of my mind 
So when I think there was a time
That I almost loved you 
You showed yourself and I 
I saw the real you 
Thank God you blew it 
I thank God I dodged a bullet 
I'm so over you 
So  baby  good lookin' out 
I wanted you bad 
I'm so through with that 
'Cause  honestly  you turned out to be
The best thing I never had 
You turned out to be the best thing I never had 
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had 
Oh yeah  I bet it sucks to be you right now 
So sad  you're hurt 
Boohoo  oh  did you expect me to care 
You don't deserve my tears 
I guess that's why they ain't there 
When I think that there was a time
That I almost loved you 
You showed your ass and baby  yes 
I saw the real you 
Thank God you blew it 
I thank God I dodged a bullet 
I'm so over you 
Baby  good lookin' out 
I wanted you bad 
I'm so through with that 
'Cause  honestly  you turned out to be
The best thing I never had 
I said you turned out to be the best thing I never had 
Mmm  and I'll never be the best thing you never had 
Oh  baby  I bet it sucks to be you right now 
I know you want me back 
It's time to face the facts 
That I'm the one that's got away 
Lord knows that it would take another place 
Another time  another world  another life 
Thank God I found the good in goodbye 
I used to want you so bad 
I'm so through with that 
'Cause  honestly  you turned out to be the best thing I never had 
Oh  you turned out to be the best thing I never had 
And I will always be the best thing you never had 
Ooh  best thing you never had 
I used to want you so bad 
I'm so through with that 
'Cause  honestly  you turned out to be the best thing I never had 
Oh  you turned out to be the best thing I never had 
And I will never be the best thing you never had 
Oh  baby  I bet it sucks to be you right now 
Goes around  comes back around (oh) 
Goes around  comes back around 
Goes around  comes back around 
Goes around  comes back around
