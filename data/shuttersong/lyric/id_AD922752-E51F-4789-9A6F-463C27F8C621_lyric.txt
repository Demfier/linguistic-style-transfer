Heap big fun
Till the break of dawn
Gonna shake a tailfeather shoot
It's gonna be a run
Hold a shotgun on the rooster
And dare him to crow
How could anybody sleep
When they could get out on the floor

Well heap big fun
Till the break of dawn
Gonna shake a tailfeather shoot
It's gonna be a run
Hold a shotgun on the rooster
And dare him to crow
How could anybody sleep
When they could get out on the floor

Tell heap big fun
Till the break of dawn
Gonna shake a tailfeather shoot
It's gonna be a run
Hold a shotgun on the rooster
And dare him to crow
How could anybody sleep
When they could get out on the floor

Tell heap big fun
Till the break of dawn
Gonna shake a tailfeather shoot
It's gonna be a run
Hold a shotgun on the rooster
And dare him to crow
