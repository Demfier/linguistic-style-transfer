I don't want a lot for christmas
there's just one thing I need
I don't care about those presents
underneath the christmas tree
I just want you for my own
more than you could ever know
make my wish come true
you know that all i want for christmas is you
I won't ask for much this christmas

I won't even wish for snow
No, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
there upon the fireplace cause
Santa, he wont make me happy
with a toy on christmas day
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl what can I do
you know that all I want for christmas is you
And all the lights are shining

so brightly everywhere

and the sound of children
laughter fills the air
and everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
santa won't you bring me the one I really love
won't you please bring my baby to me

Idon't want a lot for christmas
this is all I'm asking for

no I just want to see my baby
standing right outside my door
i just want you for my own
more than you could ever know
make my wish come true
you know that all I want
for christmas is you
is you
