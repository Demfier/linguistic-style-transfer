House of the Rising Sun - The Animals\n Written by£ºALAN PRICE\n There is a house in new orleans\n They call the rising sun\n And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\n And god I know I'm one\n My mother was a tailor\n She sewed my new blue jeans\n My father was a gamblin' man\n Down in new orleans\n Now the only thing a gambler needs\n Is a suitcase and trunk\n And the only time he's satisfied\n Is when he's on a drunk\n Oh mother tell your children\n Not to do what I have done\n Spend your lives in sin and misery\n In the house of the rising sun\n Well I got one foot on the platform\n The other foot on the train\n I'm goin' back to new orleans\n To wear that ball and chain\n Well there is a house in new orleans\n They call the rising sun\n And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\n And god I know I'm one\n
