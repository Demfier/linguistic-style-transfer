I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name
'Bout to blow

First thing's first, I'm the realest 
Drop this and let the whole world feel it 
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I could hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics 
So if you wanna bad chick like this 
Drop it low and pick it up just like this yeah
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist 
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that 
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back 
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that

I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name
'Bout to blow

I said, "Baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this."
I can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, they speak it depart it
Swagger on a super, I can't shop at no department
And get my money on time, you ain't got money, decline
I swear I meant that there so much that they give that line everyone
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be the M-A-D-D-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw

I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name
'Bout to blow

Crash the hotel
We bloody on to the veggie diner
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a word
Film star, yeah I'm deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch
