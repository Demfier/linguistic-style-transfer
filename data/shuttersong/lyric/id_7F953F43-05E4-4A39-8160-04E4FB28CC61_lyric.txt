Today I don't feel like doing anything,
I just wanna lay in my bed don't feel like picking up the phone so leave a message at the tone today I swear I'm not doing anything.

I am gonna kick my feet up stare at the fan, turn on chatroulette and put my hand down my pants, nobodys gon' tell me I can't.
