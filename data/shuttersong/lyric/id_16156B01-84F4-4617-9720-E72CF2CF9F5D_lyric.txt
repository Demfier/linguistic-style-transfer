Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't find
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you

Only you can see
The emptiness I feel when you're with me
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees

Mm, mm-mm-mm

Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Only you

Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't find
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you

(I will ready to love)
