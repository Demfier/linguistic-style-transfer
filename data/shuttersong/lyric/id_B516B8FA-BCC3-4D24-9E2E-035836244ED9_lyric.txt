Fun (Wallem Brothers 808 Remix) - Pitbull Chris Brown

 

Let's go

Chris Brown you set it off

Oh feeling crazy

 

The moon is up the night is hazy

 

Let's get lost in the shadows

 

Somewhere we can go

And no one else can find

 

Loosen up your body till you come undone

Loosen up your body baby come undone

Loosen up your body till you come undone

Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my looking like good-good time

 

Don't disguise the way you wanna love tonight

 

Oh my my hook you with a brand new high

 

Don't be shy I just wanna live tonight

Live a little F U N fun

 

Fun

 

Let's go

 

Fun

 

Fun

 

Let's go

 

Fun

 

Fresh from Monaco performing for Microsoft

Miami to L A G4 we takin' off

I'm a hard worker I'm far from the boss

But when it's said and done I'm owning it all

I know you just think it's just rap

Just this just that haha right

Now baby this my life

Wanna have fun for a night

Then just

Loosen up your body till you come undone

Loosen up your body baby come undone

Loosen up your body till you come undone

Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my looking like good-good time

 

Don't disguise the way you wanna love tonight

 

F U N fun

Let's go
