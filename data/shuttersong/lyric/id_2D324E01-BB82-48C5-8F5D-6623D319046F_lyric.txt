Look, rudeboy, I've been the man
Even when I was in the pram
Way before your Insta bang
Furthermore, before that Instagram
I'm just tryna get love, when I'm in Japan
I make the girl dem sing for man
Every MC wanna spin the man
But I kill a soundboy like I'm Ninjaman
Look, rudeboy, I've been the man
Act like you ain't been a fan
You get a déjà-vu when I rinse a man
And get messy when I Lionel twist a man
Bare likes on my Insta jam
Thug life when I spit on the cam
I tell a man sit down, ain't taking a jab
Cuh man are hot for the EP, hot for the radio
Mind that you don't get boxed in your rave clothes
I was on my boss' yacht after the Spain show
Ask Sony why they dropped the potato
How comes I always hear my name on Not For The Radio
When man ain't never been on Not For The Radio?
If them man are pagans then I've got a halo
Better than me? Yeah, go on then, say so
Cause you ain't Dizzee or Will or Kano
Don't care if you got tats or cane rolls
And the very first mixtape manaman's heard is all mine
Said in '06, '07 what I said in '09
Now it's 2015 and man are still winning
You man are just fakes, them man are just kidding
Shout out to them man Disturbing London, you know how we living
Have I gotta tell man six times on a one
Number 1, I'm still winning
Look, rudeboy, I've been the man
Even when I was in the pram
Way before your Insta bang
Furthermore, before that Instagram
I'm just tryna get love, when I'm in Japan
I make the girl dem sing for man
Every MC wanna spin the man
But I kill a soundboy like I'm Ninjaman
Look, rudeboy, I've been the man
The final boss, yeah, I've been him too
Favourite MC, yeah, I spin him too
It's me your bredrin's listening to
The next step? Make my own crep
Yeah, not the crêpe that you eat
The creps on your feet, I trend-set, see
That means nobody can crep check me
(Shut ya mout) Oh please
Man ripped up the Ts and Cs
In my black hoodie and my off-white tee
With my black gums and my off-white teeth
Vegan, I don't chat about beef
Cause I know beef is bull and I'm not a chief
If I catch man moving backwards
Punch man in all of his chakras
Yeah, sorry, I don't rehearse
Fuck a soundcheck, it only gets worse
