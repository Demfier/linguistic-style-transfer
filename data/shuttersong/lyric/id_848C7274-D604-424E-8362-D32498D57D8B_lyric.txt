Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

When I said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now you're sittin' in your house alone
Wonderin' why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know
I had to fake it til I made it
And you try to break it
Now you try to take it back but you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I wont look back
You know that

Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

I'm standing on my toes
To the sky above
And you know you're the one to thank
It's all part of the game
The game the game the game
We all play it the same

As you left you saw me walking out
You tried to knock me down
And I would go on without you
Now you're standing in the mess you made
Now you're feelin' my pain
And I'm hoping that you know that
I'm stronger cuz you made me

You will never faze me
You could never take me down
Cuz you know that
I've been doing my thing
I've been running my game
And you know I wont look back
You know that

Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

I'm standing on my toes
To the sky above
And you know you're the one to thank
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same
(play it the same, play it the same, play it the same)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Everywhere I go
And everyone who knows me
Knows that I would stand alone
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game

I'm standing on my toes
To the sky above
And you know you're the one to thank
It's all part of the game
The game, the game, the game
We all play it the same
(play it the same, the game, the game
We all play it the same
(play it the same, the game, the game)
It's all part of the game
