I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind when I think of you sometime
And I want to spend sometime with you
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us you and I
We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water all that is and it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait not to those who wait to late
We got to go for all we know
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us you and I
I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
Darling when the morning comes and see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us you and I
(just the two of us)
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
Let's get it together baby (yeah)
(just the two of us)
Just the two of us
We can make it just the two of us
(just the two of us)
We can make it just the two of us
(just the two of us)
We can make it just the two of us
(just the two of us)
We can make it just the two of us
(just the two of us)
We can make it just the two of us
(just the two of us)
We can make it just the two of us
