It's a Friday night
And I'm not in the mood
I'd rather chill with you
Tonight Summer's here to stay
But I'm not doing fine
Coz the sun don't shine
Away The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
I could have it all
But nothing, never matters
When you're gone, now
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
It's a Friday night
It's about half past two
I'd rather be with you
Yeah, tonight Summer's here to stay
But something just ain't right
Cos the sun won't shine
My way, my way
Your body says it all
It's to tell me to let go
My hearts about to blow
So I don't want to know
I've got it open now
But I don't have it together
Baby I'm no good
Without you I'm no better
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
I could have it all
But nothing, never matters
When you're gone, now
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
Where do I, where do I go
When you're not here no more
Where do I, where do I go
When you're not here no more
When the house, no longer feels like a home
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
Without you, without you
