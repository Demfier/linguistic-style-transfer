we'll do it all
everything
on our own
we don't need
anything or anyone
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me
and just forget the world?
i don't quiet know
how to say how i feel
those three words are said too much they're not enough
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world?
forget what we're told
before we get too old
show me a garden that's bursting into life
let's waste time chasing cars
around our heads
i need your grace to remind me to find my own
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world?
forget what we're told, before we get too old
show me a garden that's bursting into life all that i am
all that i ever was is here in your perfect eyes
they're all i can see
i don't know where confused about how as well just
know that these things will never change for us at all
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world?
