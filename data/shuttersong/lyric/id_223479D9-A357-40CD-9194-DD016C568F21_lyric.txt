Some nights I miss you like crazy
Some nights I wish I were dead
I miss the sound of you breathing
Can't get you out of my head
Stared out the window this morning
Took down my pictures of you
I never thought that I'd be so lonely
I really ought to figure out what I'm going to do
The fire in your eyes that I love is gone
But your smell is on my pillow
Where did we go wrong?

Cause I hate that I love you
I hate the way you say my name
And I hate the way that I fell
And got so caught up in this moment
Of what we couldn't be
You're the answers to my dreams
And my reality... Come home to me
Come home to me

I heard you got another man on the west end of the city
I bet you're happy now and you're life has changed for the
better but I bet he doesn't lay you down and whisper
things that can make your body shiver but you're way past
gone and there's no looking back from here... The fire
in my eyes has come and gone but your smell is on my pillow
this is your last song

Cause I hate that I love you
I hate the way you say my name
And I hate the way that I fell
And got so caught up in this moment
Of what we couldn't be
You're the answers to my dreams
And my reality... You're the answer
to my dreams and reality...
Come home to me
Come home to me
