One look in the mirror I can see the years gone by

Haven't made it yet gonna give you one last try


Lyrics and phrases and no coffee stains.

I believe I'm gonna make it, little by little

This time I won't break it, no, little by little

So come on, come on, come on, darling give it to me little by little

Believe me when I say to you, little by little!

Oh little by little, by little

 
I've spend so many late nights spiking my whiskey with tears

Writing songs I thought nobody would hear

Praying to the stars for a second chance somehow

Well here I stand and my time is now!

I believe I'm gonna make it, little by little

This time I won't break it, no, little by little

So come on, come on, come on, darling give it to me little by little

Believe me when I say to you, little by little!

Oh, little by little, yeah by little

 
I believe I'm gonna make it, little by little

This time I won't break it, no, little by little

So come on, come on, come on darling give it to me little by little

Believe me when I say to you, little by little!

Oh, little by little, yeah by little
