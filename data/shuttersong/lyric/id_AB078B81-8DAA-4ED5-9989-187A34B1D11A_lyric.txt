F*ck Your Stuff - P.O.S
Yo, my whole crew's on some shit
Scuffing up your nikeys, spitting on your whip
Kicking out your dj, rocking then we dip
Came crushing like a motherfucker, oh yeah
Looking out the window like Malcolm
Just when I thought this concert was open
They go without them
Fuck, too many towns, spit ice skip jewelry
Molotov cocktails on me like accessory
They could teach you how to front, I am really raw
I ain't seen a mirror in a month, but I stay fly
Spinning man, flipping out with the breeze,
I'm a stillin fan, I'ma get them
I'ma show you how to pump
Something heavy in the back,
Marshal stacks in the trunk
Got the windows down, I got the heat turned up
On blast wagon, when I'm on the west bank
And the illest die, or catch me on a mission
Pissing this on a convertible, tryina create some tension
Open a book, discussing Christopher Hitchings
Or how to make bombs with shit you find in your kitchen
Listen, hey!
Yo, my whole crew's on some shit
Scuffing up your nikeys, spitting on your whip
Kicking out your dj, rocking then we dip
We don't watch the replay, hey, hey, hey
Yo, my whole crew's on some shit
Scuffing up your nikeys, spitting on your whip
Kicking out your dj, rocking then we dip
We don't watch the replay, hey, hey, hey
I won't forget about your bucks
So if I run up with the mask on
Probably got a gas can too
And I'm not here to fill her up nope
We came here to riot
Here to incite, we don't want any of your stuff
Keep sticking to the script man, we never seen that shit
We knew the secret
Before they went ahead and we delete it
Made it off, bang it out the speakers
Hoping to smash capital quotes on the world leaders
Wait, they in the past, so we dancing on they ashes
Onward, awkward, laughing at the masses
Think you while they sit, I just go off on they ass
Wearing last year's drast, they be still be batting lashes
That's why I wanna smash, it's the passion, the go,
The lack of the muzzle and the style that's fucking irrational
Ain't fucking around, ah,
Fuck your stuff, ahaha, I mean for real
We genuinely believe that all of your shit is fake
Understand, my whole crew's on some shit
Scuffing up your nikeys, spitting on your whip
Kicking out your dj, rocking then we dip
We don't watch the replay, hey, hey, hey
I got this brick in my hand
Yo, my whole crew's on some shit
Scuffing up your nikeys, spitting on your whip
Kicking out your dj, rocking then we dip
We don't watch the replay, hey, hey, hey
Yo, my whole crew's on some shit
Scuffing up your nikeys, spitting on your whip
Kicking out your dj, rocking then we dip
We don't watch the replay, replay .
