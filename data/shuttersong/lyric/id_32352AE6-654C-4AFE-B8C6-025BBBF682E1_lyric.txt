Sun down, friday night, uptown city lights, here I go, start it out
I like
dressed up out the door
so damn ready for one night - maybe more
I like, I like
red strobe light, hot coarse, dirty minds
when you cross my way
I like, I like
just you and I touch at first sight.

And the world around us won't stop turning tonight
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right
I like, I like
we're caught in this moment I won't let you go
and the world around us won't stop turning tonight
I like, I like, I like, I like.

Hey there pure star, let's go way to far, come a little closer
I like
heart flips up and down
dancing on sleezy ground
betcha want to get it on
I like, I like
you've got me down right electrified
don't stop the rides
I like, I like
just you and I, here and now - what a night.

I, I, I, and the world around us won't stop turning tonight
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right
I like, I like
we're caught in this moment I won't let you go
and the world around us won't stop turning tonight
I like, I like, I like, I like.

Dance all night don't stop the music
I like, I can't refuse it
Dance all night don't stop the music
I like, I can't refuse it.

And the world around us won't stop turning tonight
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right
I like, I like
we're caught in this moment I won't let you go
and the world around us won't stop turning tonight
I like, I like, I like, I like.
