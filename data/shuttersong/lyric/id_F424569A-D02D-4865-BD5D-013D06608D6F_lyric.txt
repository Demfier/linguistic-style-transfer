They say we are what we are,
But we don't have to be
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I'll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame,

I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams
Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass's glass(glass)

Oooooooh,
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't
'Cause we could be Immortals, Immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now,

Pull the blackout curtains down,
Just not for long, for long
We could be Immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
...mooooooor... Immortals

Immooooooor... Immortals
(Im... Immortals)
Sometimes the only pay off for having any faith
Is when it's tested again and again everyday

I'm still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound but they're my sutures
Oooooooh

I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass's glass(glass)
Oooooooh
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't
'Cause we could be Immortals, Immortals
Just not for long, for long

And live with me forever now,
Pull the blackout curtains down,
Just not for long, for long

We could be Immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals

(Immortals)
And live with me forever now...
Pull the blackout curtains down...
We could be Immortals... Immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be Immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
...mooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
(Im... Immortals)
