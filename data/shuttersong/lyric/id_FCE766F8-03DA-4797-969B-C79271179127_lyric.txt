Stained

Coffee cup

Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Suite
Where you laid
Still a trace of innocence on the pillowcase
Waking up
Beside you, I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you

The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control

(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Taste

On my tongue
I don't wanna wash away the night before
In the heat
Where you laid
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up
Beside you, I'm a loaded gun

I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious

I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed

No control

Lost my senses
I'm defenceless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devoured
Lying here I count the hours

Waking up
Beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
No control
(No oh-oh-oh)
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control
