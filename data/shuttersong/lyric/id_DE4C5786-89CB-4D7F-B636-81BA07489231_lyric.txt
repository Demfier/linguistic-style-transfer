I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
Angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun

Get out your guns, battle's begun
Are you a saint or a sinner?
If love's a fight then I shall die
With my heart on a trigger

They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for
Well baby, you are all that I adore
If love is what you need

A soldier I will be
I'm an angel with a shotgun
Fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'll throw away my faith, babe
Just to keep you safe
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I...

Wanna live not just survive tonight
Sometimes to win, you've got to sin
Don't mean I'm not a believer
And Major Tom will sing along

Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer
They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for
Well baby, you are all that I adore

If love is what you need, a soldier I will be
I'm an angel with a shotgun
Fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'll throw away my faith, babe
Just to keep you safe
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I...

Wanna live, not just survive tonight

Ohh, ohh whoa whoa, ohh...

I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun
I'm an angel with a shotgun
Fighting 'til the war's won

I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'm an angel with a shotgun
Fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'll throw away my faith, babe
Just to keep you safe
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I... (I'm an angel with a shotgun)
Want to live, not just survive (Live, not just survive)
And I...
I'm gonna hide, hide, hide my wings tonight
They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for
Well baby, you are all that I adore
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be
