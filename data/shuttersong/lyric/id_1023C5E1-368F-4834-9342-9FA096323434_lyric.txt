Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like tall, tan
Driving 'round the city
Flirting with the girls like you're so pretty
Springsteen is the king don't you think

I was like hell yeah that guy can sing
Like woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby you spin me round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Like an American

Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
LA, I don't even have to fake it now
You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, ge-get it
Elvis is the best, hell yes
Honey put on that party dress

Like woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Like an American

Everybody wants to go fast, but they can't compare
I don't really want the rest, only you can take me there
I don't even know what i'm saying
But I'm praying for you

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, you spin me round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Like an American
Like an American
Like an American
Like an American
