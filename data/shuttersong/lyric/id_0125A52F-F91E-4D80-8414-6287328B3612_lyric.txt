Drop a couple tears over these written words, destined for greatness ever since the day I was given birth
Born with a curse but I'm just tryna convince the earth everytime I did something wrong I had no intent to hurt

I spit the words of crown men, walk with my head high, to your towns end, came to preach the heart of thousands
Heres the announcement, Phora's in the house everybody circles around him speakin with the depth of the sea, height of a mountain
And they doubt it until they realize his vision was the truest, realize no indviual could do this

Gimmie a pen and Ima use it in a fashion and nobody else can fool with, making more than music is a mothafuckn' movement
Pullin nothin but the truest leavin mothafucka's clueless so lets knuckle up and do this
All the kids that hate me need to cuddle up and group kiss they said I'll never make it so I'll struggle just to prove it

Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous its hard to show my love cause growin up I never felt it
Misery loves company, so darling take my hand please come with me

Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous its hard to show my love cause growin up I never felt it
Misery loves company, so darling take my hand please come with me

Keep your enemies the closest, the thing is if they were but I was too blind to notice
Tryna send a message give a fuck about the show biz, my father use to give the cold shoulder to his own kids
That's probably why I'm so upset they tryna make me go to rest.
but you'll never see me sleep cause its to close to death

Coke n' Meth in my fathers blood stream when he made me, born in 94' just another crack baby
From another black lady and my motha can't tame me, no father figure so you fuckas can't blame me

Learn to get used to it, ain't that crazy?
the street lights and the train tracks raised me nigga

Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous its hard to show my love cause growin up I never felt it
Misery loves company, so darling take my hand please come with me

Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous its hard to show my love cause growin up I never felt it
Misery loves company, so darling take my hand please come with me
