Sara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes she's home and sometimes she can't be found,
Turnaround

Sara's off, half hiding, far above the clouds, high she flies
I know I've got to find her a place she can push her toes around in
She needs a place where she can lounge and wear a gown in
Sara turnaround turnaround

And any night she's here or half way 'round the world, oh I could
Cry
So I know I've got to pray for delays and for days 'til she's besides
Me
All alone in her room and her scattered clothes remind me
Sara please
Sara
turnaround
