Baby Your All That I Want,
when you lying here in my arms
I'm Finding it hard to believe, were in heaven
(Shes my lady, my baby, my women air)

Shes hot as hell yeah,
But shes my heaven
She is my eve,
Im her apple for example
We got that sinful passion,
We got that hot lust
We got that one in a million love,
All of the above
let them talk they envy,
I love them text's you send me
with a pic attached
Your girlfriend she friendly
You like a quarterback you'll go down in the sack
our love is never ending, thats why they hate like that

05 thats right,
this life can be deceitful
and my career attracts,
all the wrong people
If you find a keeper
then you better keep her
I always put her first,
her love is heaven on earth
