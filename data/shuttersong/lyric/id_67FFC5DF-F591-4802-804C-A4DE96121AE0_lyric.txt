For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be moving on
And I think it should be something
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
Now I know I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself
And if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open just admit it
See I gave you faith turned your doubt into hoping
can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me where are you now that I need you where are you now
Where are you now that I need ya couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now
Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back what you saying
to keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
that's for sure
Now I was on my knees
when nobody else was praying oh lord
Where are you now that I need ya
I need you the most
Where are you now that I need ya
I need you the most
