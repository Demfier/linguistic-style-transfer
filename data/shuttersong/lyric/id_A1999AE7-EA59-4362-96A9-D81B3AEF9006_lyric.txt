You got me so wild
How can I ever tonight?
You got me so high
So high I cannot feel the fire

And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these

Promises and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises and they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself

You got me so wild
How can I ever tonight?
You got me so high
So high I cannot feel the fire

And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these

Promises and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises and they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
And they still feel all so wasted on myself
