Where colors collide

And beam up the sky

Flowing like rivers of gold

The street of lights

A place where all your dreams can come to life

No matter the fight

You'll be all right

In the city of lights

The city of lights

The city of lights

No matter the fight

You'll be all right

In the city of lights

The city of lights (The city of lights)

The city of lights

 
Wherever we go the story unfolds

What the stars have in store nobody knows

So just come with me we own the night

No matter the fight

You'll be all right

In the city of lights

The city of lights

The city of lights

No matter the fight

You'll be all right

In the city of lights

The city of lights

No matter the fight

You'll be all right

In the city of lights

The city of lights
