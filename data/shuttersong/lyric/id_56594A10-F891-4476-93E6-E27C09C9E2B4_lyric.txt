Coming in announced, drive my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can't just follow my smile
Your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
They cutting me to the bone, they got to leave behind
You wanna kick it to seel just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight till the end
This might be your battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle, but you feel so LA
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh

And I love the way you hurt me it's irresistible
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby

I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your walls, to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it baby, I'm talking no inflation

Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks and not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love about for falling at it
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh

And I love the way you hurt me it's irresistible
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby

You're silky and smooth
You're silky and smooth
I breath you in, honey I don't know what you're doing to me
Won't you believe, but the truth catches up with us eventually
Tryina say live, live live live
I'm no good good, admit to this
Second is yours,???

I still love the way you hurt me,
It's irresistible!
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me baby
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me baby
