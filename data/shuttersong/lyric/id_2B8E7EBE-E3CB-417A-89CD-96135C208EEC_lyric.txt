I got you
I got a hold of you
Said you want to see
How we roll
Well take a seat (take a seat)
And we'll just
Drink it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta, taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby
Don't you worry, you gotta keep up
Cuz I been gone, I been gone, I been gone, I been gone

Girl
Why don't you fuck what you heard, baby
Cause I been gone
You can see for yourself, lady
Girl, I lit you something
Something something, for you
You would love to pass around

Yeah, yeah, yea yea yea yea

Oh well just- Drink it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
Gotta taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby
Don't you worry, dont you worry, you gotta keep up
Cause I been gone
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone

Youll be thinking of it

Watch us rock it out

Watch us leave it girl
After the show is done
You can take take me to yours

But my lungs so muddy
I love the way you taste
Drink it till I'm ugly baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denim
Babygirl I gotcha

Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak

And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit

But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin
Cuz I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it

I could win a fucking oscar
By the way I fuckin did it
And you won't ever fuckin know
Cuz I won't ever fuckin show it
Except when I be wheezy from that other cup of potion

Dirty spiked toastin
Fast life fuck slow
Low life for life
