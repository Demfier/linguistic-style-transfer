I was sitting around
Coming up with something new
when a girl like you
came into my life
i thought i figured it out
but you changed it up somehow
what am i supposed to do
now
well you flipped the script
you changed up the game
ever since i met you
things just havent been the same
but baby baby sometime
youve gotta realize
what you do to me
now

You got me
tongue tied im at a loss for words
just like
Noah and Allie we can be some birds
but you
changed up everything around me
lovestruck
got me feelin like im crazy

but youre never gonna believe the kinda things she said to me
when she told me it was love i really struggled to see
what we could possibily be
you were so different to me
youve got me down on my knees
while i feel im sinking
in your river of tears
and you call me capitan
but what ever happened to this love?
that we had for years
it was hard to call it quits when
i was the only one who gave a shit
about us

never again
never again
never x26
