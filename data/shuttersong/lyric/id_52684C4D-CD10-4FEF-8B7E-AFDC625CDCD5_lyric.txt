I love you like I love the sun
Shining down no matter what
You know just how to lock me up
I love you like I love the sun.
I need you like I need to breathe
Without you my heart couldn't breathe
You're in my blood, you're part of me
I need you like I need to breathe.

Tell me what, tell me what would I be?
Without you baby, I'm not me!
Tell me what, tell me what would I do
I'm losing all, but I gotta have you, you, you!

I want you like a burning flame
I wake up calling out your name
Don't take your time, don't make me wait
I want you like a burning flame!

Tell me what, tell me what would I be?
Without you baby, I'm not me!
Tell me what, tell me what would I do
I'm losing all, but I gotta have you, you, you!
I gotta have you, you, you!

You saved me like an answered prayer
A constant faith that's always there
I take you with me everywhere
You saved me like an answered prayer!

Tell me what, tell me what would I be?
Without you baby, I'm not me!
Tell me what, tell me what would I do
I'm losing all, but I gotta have you, you, you!
I gotta have you, you, you!
