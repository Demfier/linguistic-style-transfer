The Nights - Avicii
Hey  once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey  When face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Make memories we knew would never fade
One day my father he told me
Son  don't let this slip away
He took me in his arms 
I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said  one day you'll leave
This world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me
When I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shinning stars
He said go adventure far
Beyond these shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter
Where you are
One day my father he told me
Son  don't let this slip away
When I was just a kid 
I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live
For younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said  one day you'll leave
This world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me
When I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
These are the night that never die
My father told me
My father told me
