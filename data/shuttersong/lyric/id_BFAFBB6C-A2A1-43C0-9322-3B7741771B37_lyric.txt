Quiet nights feel like a murmur

But we all wanna feel the heartbeat
Silence seeming cold like winter
Till we get our souls we cant breath
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder

We are waiting as our dreams turn to color
Every second wanting more its a calm before the storm
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder
This is the only truth we want
Watching the sky for a hint of a spark
Sailing further towards the unknown
Melting down our hearts of stone
Lift our happy hands from the cold
The wind whispers you are never ever alone
Never ever alone

We are waiting for the lights and the thunder
We are waiting as our dreams turn to color
Every second wanting more its a calm before the storm
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder
We are waiting for the lights and the thunder
