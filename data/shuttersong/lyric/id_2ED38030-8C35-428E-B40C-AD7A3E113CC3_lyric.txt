I think the universe is on my side
Heaven and Earth have finally aligned
Days are good and that's the way it should be
You sprinkle star dust on my pillow case
It's like a mooning brushed across my face
Nights are good and that's the way it should be
You make sing ooohhh la la laaa
Ooohhh la la laaa
You make sing ooohhh la la laaa
Ooohhh la la laaa
You make sing
And I see colors in a different way
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
Life is good and that's the way it should be
You make sing ooohhh la la laaa
Ooohhh la la laaa
You make sing ooohhh la la laaa
Ooohhh la la laaa
You make sing
'Cause now I'm shining bright so bright
And I get lost in your eyes
Now I'm shining bright so bright
Bright so bright
You make sing Ooohhh so bright
Ooohhh so bright
Now I'm shining oooohhh so bright
Ooohhh so bright
'Cause now I'm shining bright so bright
Bright so bright
Bright so bright
And I get lost in your eyes
Now I'm shining Ooohhh so bright
Ooohhh so bright
Now I'm shining Ooohhh so bright
Ooohhh so bright
Now I'm shining bright
