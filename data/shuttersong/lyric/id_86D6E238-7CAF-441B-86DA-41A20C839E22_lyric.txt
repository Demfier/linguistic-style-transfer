Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a Turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa is on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh

And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering a simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Merry Christmas
