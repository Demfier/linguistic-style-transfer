A flock of birds
Hovering abovttttttttt
That's how you think of love
And I always

Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on
A flock of birds

Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following them up
Still I always

Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
So fly on, ride through

maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on
