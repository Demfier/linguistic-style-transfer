We were younger than ever,
sitting in the back of a corvetteâ€¦.
and all I remember,
was lying naked in our summer sweat.
and I was falling in love,
while you were fighting the weekend war.
We were on top of the world,
but you don't come around here in anymore.
whenever I look back now,
forever nineteen somehow...
'Cause when i put on my jean jacket,
I still think about you.
I wish I could drive you home,
Listening to Thunder Road,
'Cause when I put on my jean jacket,
I still think about you.
Hey, where did you go?
we were younger than ever,
doing 110 on the boulevard,
Swore we'd never surrender,
We found faith in a stolen car.
and I was falling in love,
while you were fighting the weekend war.
We were on top of the world,
but you don't come around here anymore.
whenever I look back now,
forever nineteen somehow...
'Cause when i put on my jean jacket,
I still think about you.
I wish I could drive you home,
Listening to Thunder Road,
'Cause when I put on my jean jacket,
I still think about you.
Hey, where did you go?
