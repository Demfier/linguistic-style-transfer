The morning starts like any other,
I find myself Infront of the mirror,
Picking out my inperfections,
Scared the world might see, the flaws I see,

But should it really matter?
Why does it mean so much to me?
I wish I could believe in inner beauty,

I don't wanna be looked at,
if I can't see past all of my pretty lies,
There's more to this picture if you look deeper,
You will find me behind these eyes,
I'm right here,
Behind these eyes

So greens the colour for the seasons,
But will it change the way I'm feeling,
Tell me Mr Maharishi,
What size is happy?
And the stars are getting smaller,
Disappearing as they fall from grace,
I keep reading how they stop to get their column space,

I don't wanna be looked at,
if I can't see past all of my pretty lies,
There's more to this picture if you look deeper,
You will find me behind these eyes,
I'm right here,
Behind these eyes
I'm right here behind these eyes,
I'm right here behind these eyes,

I'm wondering how far il go,
To fix myself and I don't know,
What will it cost to put me right?
When I'm not wrong on the inside...

I don't wanna be looked at,
if I can't see past all of my pretty lies,
There's more to this picture if you look deeper,
You will find me behind these eyes,

I don't wanna be looked at,
if I can't see past all of my pretty lies,
There's more to this picture if you look deeper,
You will find me behind these eyes,
I'm right here,
Behind these eyes
I'm right here
Behind these eyes
I'm right here
Behind these eyes...
