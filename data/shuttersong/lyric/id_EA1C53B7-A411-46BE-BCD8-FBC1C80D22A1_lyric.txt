You got holes in your jeans
and few in your heart
You don't know what it means to me, to watch you fall apart
Cause your broken and bruised, but I can hold you close.
I'll take you in my arms tonight, just me and you.
Baby in a heart beat
I'll take you with me
I just wanna get to know you

You're throwing me off beat
So I can't breathe
I just wanna get to show you
If we're falling apart
I will fight for your heart
I can be your shield
I'll fight on the field
Baby when our life gets colder
I'll be your soldier.
Na na na na na
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
Just put up your arms, you'll be alright.
Cause the world is like a battlefield, but I'll be here to fight.

I see the scars and your wounds, I'll try to heal them to.

I'll take you in my arms tonight, just me and you.
Baby in a heart beat
I'll take you with me
I just wanna get to know you
You're throwing me off beat
So I can't breathe

I just wanna get to show you
If we're falling apart

I will fight for your heart
I can be your shield
I'll fight on the field
Baby when our life gets colder
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
When you're feeling low, I can take you higher.
When the world is cold, I can be your fire.
I'll be there, when you need a shoulder
We can win this war

I will be your soldier.
Cause
Baby in a heart beat

I'll take you with me
I just wanna get to know you
You're throwing me off beat
So I can't breathe

I just wanna get to show you
If we're falling apart
I will fight for your heart
I can be your shield

I will fight on the field
Baby when our life gets colder
I'll be your soldier
Na na na na na
I'll be your soldier
I'll be your your soldier.
na na na na
I'll be your soldier.
