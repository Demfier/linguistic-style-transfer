I turn around to see you
But the color of the city lights
Make everything so hazy
I'm trying to believe you
But it hurts to hear you say
That the city has changed us

Remember the nights when we'd lie out right on the pavement?
Staring up as we watched the stars dance across the evening sky
And why did we move away from the quiet country?
Trading rubber and dust for rubble and rust
As we fade away underneath the city lights
Are we fading away underneath the city lights?
Are we fading away underneath the city lights?

And how did it come to this?
We left a happy home for this
Where the roof and the walls of that old house
Were pieces of us, but now
The night sky burns street light to street light
From your eyes run tears of a past life
In a pool of memories on the floor

Remember the nights when we'd lie out right on the pavement?
Staring up as we watched the stars dance across the evening sky
And why did we move away from the quiet country?
Trading rubber and dust for rubble and rust
As we fade away underneath the city lights
Are we fading away underneath the city lights?
Are we fading away underneath the city lights?

We were just kids livin' a small town growin' too quick
And our hearts set on leavin' it
We left home runnin' with our hands clasped tight
But somewhere along the lines we lost sight
And now we're two strangers runnin' lost in a big town
The bright lights, they inspire you when the sun goes down
Where do they lead you now?
Where do they lead you now?

Remember the nights when we'd lie out right on the pavement?
Staring up as we watched the stars dance across the evening sky
And why did we move away from the quiet country?
Trading rubber and dust for rubble and rust
As we fade away underneath the city lights
Underneath the city lights
Underneath the city lights
As we're fading away underneath the city lights
