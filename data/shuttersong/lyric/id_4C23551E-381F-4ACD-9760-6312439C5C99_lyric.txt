It's a big bad world
But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world
But I ain't ashamed
I like the lights in my hand
And beat in my face

B-B-B-Beat in my face
I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

And the beat in my face

I like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world
