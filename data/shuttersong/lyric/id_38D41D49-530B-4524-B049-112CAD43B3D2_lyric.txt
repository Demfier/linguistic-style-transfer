I can't believe that I ended up here
I can't believe, I can't believe that
Just wanna thought that the road was so clear
Had no idea, had no idea
You come right out of nowhere
Spin me all around
How did you make my world come crashing down tonight
You made my perfect picture look like black and white
I know I've never seen my colours so alive
With you around I know that we're gonna be fine tonight
You made my perfect picture come to life
We always think that we know what we want
That's where we go (where we go)
Where we going
We always think we have it all figured out
But all we know (all we know)
We know is nothing
One thing can make it all change
So hold on tight
Hold on tight
One thing can make it all change
In just one night
I don't know why
Come right out of nowhere
Spin me around
How did you make my world
Come crashing down
Tonight
You made my perfect picture look like black and white
I know I've never seen my colors so alive.
With you around I know that we're gonna be fine
Tonight
You made my perfect picture come to life, life, life
You made my perfect picture come to life, life And I don't know
And I don't know why
You came right out of nowhere
Spin me around How did you make my world
Come crashing down
Tonight
You made my perfect picture look like black and white
I know I've never seen my colors so alive.
With you around I know that we're gonna be fine
Tonight
You made my perfect picture come to life
Tonight
You made my perfect picture come to life
Tonight
You made my perfect picture come to life
