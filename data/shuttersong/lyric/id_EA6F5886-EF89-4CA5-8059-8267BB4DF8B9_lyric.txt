Shorty I can see u aint lonely handfull of niggas n they all got cheese 
So u lookin at me now whats it gonna be just another tease far as I can see 
Tryin get u up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs 
Throwin bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cuz I'm far from a scrub
