 Kingston Town
the night seems to fade,
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone
The stars shine so bright,
But they`re fading after dawn
There is magic in  kingston  town
Oh  kingston  town,
The place i long to be
If i had the whole world
I would give it away
Just to see, the girls at play
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And when i am king,
Surely i would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now i am king,
And my queen will come at dawn
She`ll be waiting in  kingston  town
Oh  kingston  town,
The place i long to be

And a palace and everything, yeah
And now i am king,
And my queen will come at dawn
She`ll be waiting in  kingston  town
She`ll be waiting in  kingston  town
She`ll be waiting in  kingston  town
