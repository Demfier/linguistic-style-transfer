Hey, little girl with your tangled hair
Your tattered clothes.
Your 15
And you're about to bloom just like a rose.

You're wishing that you had designer jeans.
Like the ones you see in magazines.
I know you'd give anything just to fit in
But you aren't on a price tag, it comes from within.

Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are
Hey, there little home coming queen

In that back seat.
I bet his brown eyes
are promising you everything.
I know you want to be just like your friend

But he'll still love you if you don't give in
If those girls are being honest that have been were you're at
I bet they'd tell you that they wish they had their innocence back.
Don't you know you're beautiful?

Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are.
Still he left you for a girl that could be your twin
If you were twenty-eight again.

Let him go (Let him go)
Let him fly (let him fly)
Keep your head up get on with your life.
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?

Just the way you are
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are
(Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're...)
Just the way you are
(Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?)
