Collide - Jake Miller
I'm falling out of the sky
I feel so alive
My heart ignites
When our eyes Collide
Oh oh yeah
Collide
Oh oh yeah
Collide
Yeah
Don't hold back crash into me
We catching fire like a third degree
Need someone to hold sick of being alone
So I'm roundin' third and I'm coming home
'Cause I need your touch and I need it now
We can go to lunch and then mess around
So baby if you with it
You can come and get it
We can build an empire in a New York minute
Me and you stopping time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like
When we Collide
When we Collide
When we Collide
I'm falling out of the sky
I feel so alive
My heart ignites
When our eyes Collide
Oh oh yeah
Collide
Oh oh yeah
Collide
I'm gone
Hungover
I'm love drunk and not sober
Yeah it's do or die baby you and I
We should get just a little bit closer
So baby come and hop up on my range
Swerve
These other girls I kick em to the side
Curb
Your love rains down like a meteor shower
That's crashing down on earth
Me and you stopping time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like
When we Collide
When we Collide
When we Collide
Oo oh oh
Oo oh oh oh
Oo oh oh
Oo oh oh oh
Me and you stopping time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like
Me and you stopping time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like
When we Collide
When we Collide
When we Collide
When we Collide
When we Collide
