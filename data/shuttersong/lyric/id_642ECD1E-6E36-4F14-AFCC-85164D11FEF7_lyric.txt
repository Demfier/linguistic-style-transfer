Is it really necessary
Every single day
You're making me more ordinary
In every possible way

This ordinary mind is broken
You did it and you don't even know
You're leaving me with words unspoken
You better get back 'cause I'm ready for

More than this whatever it is
Baby, I hate days like this
Caught in a trap, I can't look back
Baby, I hate days like this

When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains

More than this
Baby, I hate days like

Trying to be ordinary
Was it me who was the fool?
Thought you found the man you wanted
Till you turn him into something new

Well, even if our minds are broken
There's something that I need you to know
It's nothing like the life we wanted
You better move on 'cause I ready for

More than this whatever it is
Baby, I hate days like this
Caught in a trap, I can't look back
Baby, I hate days like this

When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains

When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains

More than this
Baby, I hate days like

I'm not angry, don't know what to do
After all the years that I spent you
Can't blame you for the things you said
You were used to hide away

More than this whatever it is
Baby, I hate days like this
Caught in a trap, I can't look back
Baby, I hate days like this

When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains

When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains
When it rain rain rain, it rain rain rains

More than this
Baby, I hate days like
