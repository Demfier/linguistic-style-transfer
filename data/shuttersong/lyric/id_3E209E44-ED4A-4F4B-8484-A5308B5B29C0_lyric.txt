I can't live with my mistakes
Get out of bed or face this day
But I need to
Needle in my eye
I just need you to go sit down
'Cause I told you I'd bury it deep in the ground
A joke a stroke of genius
Probably somewhere in between
No joke the broken records laughing while
While she gags and screams
A love from up above my neck
But still below my spleen
I am what I am
Who am I?
I don't know what that means.
But I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I'm not a kid?
That's my mistake
Get out of bed
Nah fuck this day
But I need to
Needle in my eye
I just need you to be around
But I told you I'd bury it deep in the ground
A joke a stroke of genius
Probably somewhere in between
No joke the broken records laughing while
While she gags and screams
A love from up above my neck
But still below my spleen
I am what I am
Who am I?
I don't know what that means.
But I wanna meet Dave Grohl
I wanna be Dave Grohl
I wanna be Dave Grohl
Never gonna stop me
