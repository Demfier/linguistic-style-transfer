Word on road, it's the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before

[Hook]
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)

[Drake]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas got to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be you knight in shining armor all tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next thing, YMCMB (ah)

That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean

That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean

[Drake]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way to hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all ties
Girl they love me like I'm prince, new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)

How you mean, how you mean, thought knew about the team (ay)
How you mean, how you mean, thought knew about the team (ay)
