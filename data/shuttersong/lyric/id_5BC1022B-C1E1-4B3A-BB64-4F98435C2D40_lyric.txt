We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack, you make up

We make a really good team
Though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry between us

Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clich√©s on our own little tour
Let's ride

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money

All I need is you
All I need is you, you

We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy

And we take jokes way too far
'Cause sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
We are, we are, we are

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

We're not a commercial for everyone else
We go out for coffee and keep to ourselves
We make little homes out of 3 star hotels

And I know what you're feeling
Cause I feel it as well

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you
