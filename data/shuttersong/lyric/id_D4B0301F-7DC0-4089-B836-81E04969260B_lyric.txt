See me up in the club with 50 of them girls
Posted in the back got my bangs and my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking babe
Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking babe)

Tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking babe)
Tell me how it's looking babe looking babe
Drop the bass mane the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up" I just go slower
High like treble pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cus when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting

Red wine drip talk that trash
Chauffer eavesdropping trying not to crash

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe
Le sexe je veux dire l'activit¨¦ physique le co?t tu aimes ?a
Tu ne t'int¨¦resses pas au sexe
Les hommes pensent que les f¨¦ministes
D¨¦testent le sexe mais c'est une activit¨¦
Tr¨¨s stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent
Take all of me

The kind of girl you like girl you like

I just wanna be the girl you like girl you like
The kinda girl you like
