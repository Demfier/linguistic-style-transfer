This world doesn't need no opera
We're here for the operation
We don't need a bigger knife (a bigger knife)
Cause we got guns, we got guns, we got guns (we got balls
We got balls, you better run
(you better run, you better run, you better run)
We're killing strangers, we're killing strangers
We're killing strangers, so we don't kill the ones that we love

We're killing strangers, we're killing strangers
We're killing strangers, so we don't kill the ones that we
Love, love, love, love
We pack demolition
We can't pack emotion
Dynamite, we just might

So blow us a kiss, blow us a kiss
Blow us a kiss, and we'll blow you to pieces
We're killing strangers, we're killing strangers

We're killing strangers so we don't kill the ones that we
Love, love, love, love
And we got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better better, better run
We got guns, we got guns

Motherfuckers better run
We got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better better, better run
We got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better .
We're killing strangers, we're killing strangers

We're killing strangers so we don't kill the ones that we love
(better run)
We're killing strangers

(we got guns)
We're killing strangers
(we got guns)
We're killing strangers so we don't kill the ones that we
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
You better run
We got guns, we got guns, we got guns
