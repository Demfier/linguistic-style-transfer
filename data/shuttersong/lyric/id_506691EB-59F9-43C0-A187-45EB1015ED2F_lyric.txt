(Verse 1)
Fuck my life it's how I feel when I wake up
I don't see the light inside this tunnel of mine
My girl just left I guess we're gonna break up
Minus fucking around with some other guy
My homie wanna go and kicking some other time
I'm dead broke and worked another one of the day
My car broke down and tolled a trunk in the way
My buster really give a fuck he wrote me up late
He gon' fuck around and then he getting punched in the face
But I gotta control my temper 'cause I wanna get paid
For this restaurant I wanna set it and blaze
And take my own life I'd do it if I wasn't afraid
And I would live so fuck slitting my wrist
'Cause if I was dumb enough to commit I'd would use a gun
Glue me getting drunk and my road for months
And now my parents on my bare said they lose a song
But what if I went on home and found my sister then
And with the brother and the color saw what my brother did
Got a house the size of my little cousin's crib
And I complain to blame on the jaws of dead
And now my partners saw my zilly 'cause my storm begins
This puppy jumped again and get a punch to kick
A bunch of hoes in the wall checking off the trip
And to the dark side, anybody coming with

(Hook)
Like to say they're fond to me
Everything around me is crumbling
If you feel the same then come with me
'Cause misery loves company
Everybody seems so bumbly
Does anybody feel as bumbed as me
If you do then come with me
'Cause misery loves company
Misery loves company
Misery loves company
Misery loves company
Misery loves company

(Verse 2)
Fuck these new ports 'cause I can't afford them
I'm sick and tired of all my homies wanting to bum one
It's funny that I use the word bum
'Cause if I don't come up soon rap then I'ma probably become one
I feel like people talk behind my back where I come from
If they supporting me I'd be a relic of one tone
But every time I stumble across upon some critic
They call me fat and ugly why the fuck are some dumb
Kid on the internet as we off as much
I just did discuss it like I lost my touch
They don't realize how many lies are at stake
My faith rise on this give me some pies for once
When they see me they gon' wish I had some boxing gloves
'Cause then at everybody like I'm some obnoxious drunk
Came in the shot one said I'm a shawty fat
And apart the drunk
Radio here we go we lost it, run
The sunshine is gone can't our way in the dark
Legging in the bed and make pray to God
Bitch show me a better way to make it and lost
I thought I found my lady but she breakin my heart
The sinners hittin the thought but she's gone for good
And saw to put on her happy face just forget
So I pop me a pill take enough the trick
Until the dark side anybody coming with me
I say

(Verse 3)
Dear Lord is it really all in my head
Lately I've been thinking I'd been better off dead
I tell my girl she think I'm playing I bet
One day she gon find me dead in our bed
I'm pathetic guy lid all the simple shit bother me
And I'm gonna be a baby bottle inside of me
Until I call to see the day
Suicidal with society would be a little minus
I don't think they really miss me when I'm gone
My lady she can go and suck as many dicks she wants
My family photos will be now without me in them
And my friends don't have to talk behind my back and try to farm
They want me to make it and I know they really don't
They just want to see me broke unless I can take 'em with
So they can get a free ride and I'm tryin to make a grip
Out the sweat and the tears I dont put
I just signed a record deal why the fuck am I so pissed
Maybe I'm just scared I'm a fail and I'm still
That these industry people don't wanna give me no props
'Cause on a scale to 1 to 10 I'ma trip on myself
In the bum with the bottle getting drunk as shit
Unhealthy my liver has had enough again
Fuck that I'm in trouble take enough the trip
To the dark side anybody coming with
