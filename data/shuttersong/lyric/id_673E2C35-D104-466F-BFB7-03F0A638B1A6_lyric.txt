I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you be a part time lover to me
Listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used lay
And re stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day

When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breath
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say you were beautiful without your make up
And you don't need even to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that god made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I was away too much

Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
So say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina

Oh won't you leave me now

Now...
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching blue planet, creating new habits

Acting as if we was two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
I understand but I can't help
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just revaluate it quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane

But in a day we'd have to say it again
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina

But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina

Oh won't you leave me now
Now...
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song
Go oh won't you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back go oh won't you leave me now
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And i've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And i've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
Now...
