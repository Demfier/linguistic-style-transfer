Into the brave new world
I hope I see you on the other side
Of this changing world

Baby when my ship pulls in
I try to believe in anyone
Look at the state I'm in

But for now
I'm just sittin' at the table
Hearin' songs
Wishin' I was able, stable

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)

Brother don't try to find
Don't try to believe in anyone
For I would change your mind

Baby when my ship pulls in
I try to believe in anyone
Look at the state I'm in, I'm fine

But for now
I'm just sittin' at the table
Hearin' songs
Wishin' I was able, stable

Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)

I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side

But for now
I'm just sittin' at the table
And I'm hearin' songs
Wishin' I was able, stable

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah nah nah
 (Brave new world)
Nah nah nah
 (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah nah nah
 (Brave new world)
