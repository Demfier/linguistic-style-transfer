When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are ([Frankie:] hey hey hey, hey hey hey)

[Vanessa]
Yeah
Oh, your eyes, your eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
[All]
Your hair, your hair
[Vanessa]
Falls perfectly without you trying
[Vanessa/Mollie]
You're so beautiful
[Vanessa]
And I tell you everyday ([Frankie:] Hey hey hey, hey hey hey)

[Vanessa]
Yeah
I know, I know
When I compliment you, you won't believe me
[Vanessa/Una]
And it's so, it's so
[Vanessa]
Sad to think that you don't see what I see
But every time you ask me, 
[Rochelle]
"Do I look okay?"
[Vanessa]
I say

[All]
When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

[Rochelle]
Yeah
Your lips, your lips
I could kiss them all day if you'd let me
[All]
Your laugh, your laugh
[Rochelle]
You hate but I think it's so sexy
[Rochelle/Mollie]
You're so beautiful
[Rochelle]
And I tell you everyday ([Frankie:] Hey hey hey, hey hey)

[Una/Mollie]
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
[Una]
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[All]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile 
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, you're amazing
Just the way you are

[Vanessa]
The way you are ([All:] Ahhhhhhhhh)
The way you are
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are 

[Vanessa]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
[Vanessa/Una]
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, you're amazing
Just the way you are

[Una]
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
