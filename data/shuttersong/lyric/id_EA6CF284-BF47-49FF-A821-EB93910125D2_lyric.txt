Hey girl, what you're doin?
Yeah, you knocked me down to the floor
The way you use your sex-appeal, yeah
It makes me keep wanting more
'Cause the hold you got on me is strong
You control me with your ways
And I won't fuck with you anymore
But I still do it anyway
What can I do? I'm just so caught up
You knocked me on the floor, and now
What more can I do?
Would you picture me in it with that UV love?
UV love!
You're so venomous
Now you set me up for the kill
And your sex is dangerous
I'm addicted to how you feel!
And I'm so strong strong and don't know
Might just can't come down
You trapped me in your love
I'm gonna realize when you ain't around
'Cause the hold you got on me is strong
You control me with your ways
And I won't fuck with you anymore
But I still do it anyway
What can I do? I'm just so caught up
And now I can't get it up
What more can I do?
Would you picture me in it with that UV love?
Violet love!
You got to hold your UV love
Yeah, you, you got to hold your UV
Listen up! Coming up from different world
Ain't nobody better, I should know, I've checked
How you walked them heels when you walked in here
You dressed up, them bitches can't win it
No contest, God bless â€˜em!
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Then on top of me, or between you on me
And I'll give you my salary
Just to see you smile for me,
You like it, I like it
How I always on top of you girl
And if you go, you can have my coat
You keep go wherever I go
And I go so hard I can't no do
What pussy do if I'm??
And take that and throw it up to the sky
What can I do? I'm just so caught up
And now I can't get it up
What more can I do?
Would you picture me in it with that UV love?
Violet love!
Youuu got UV love,
Yeah youuu, you got to hold your UV love!!
