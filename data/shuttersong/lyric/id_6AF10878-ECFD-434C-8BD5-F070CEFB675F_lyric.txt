Luck Runs Out

Crawl from the wreckage one more time

Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel it burn
Still life... incarnation
Still life... infamy

Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come? What's to be?
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face

Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Luck Runs Out
And you crawl back in... but your luck runs out
Luck Runs Out
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide, but will be found

Release your grip without a sound

Still life... immolation

Still life... infamy

Hallucination

Heresy
Still you run, what's to come? What's to be?
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Luck Runs Out
And you crawl back in... but your luck runs out

Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Luck Runs Out
And you crawl back in... but your luck runs out
Your luck runs out
