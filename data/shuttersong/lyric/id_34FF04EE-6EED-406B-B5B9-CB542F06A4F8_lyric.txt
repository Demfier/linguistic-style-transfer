What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
I say what goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around...

There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good lookin' out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that'
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'm gonna' always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes I saw the real you
Thank God you blew itI thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over youBaby good lookin' out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
I said, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby I bet sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another
life

Thank God I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh you turned out to be (the best thing I never had)

And I will always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you I don't wanna lose you,
But I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you

But I don't wanna be the one to cry
And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough

Now I could never change you
I don't wanna blame you
Baby you don't have to take the fall
(You don't have to take the fall)
Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just wanna have it all
It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
Like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
Do you feel me beside you in your bed?
There beside you, where I used to lay?

Oooh, oh, oh
Sometimes love just ain't enough
Oooh
There's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Sometimes
Baby sometimes love, just ain't enough
Oooh, oh, mmmmm, mmmm
6, 763 out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh you turned out to be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now...
what goes around, comes back around... (I bet it sucks to be you right now)
