I care about you, baby.
Baby, more than you'll ever know.
More than you'll ever know.
Please do not drive me crazy, crazy.
Unless you gonna go
with me.
No pressure
No Pressure, I know you're real.
The Pressure
The Pressure will make you feel.
Up till the sun rises
There's no compromising.
I know, I know, I know
you are such a liar.
I never denied you
I was for sure.
But it's really out of my control
the way you feel is not my problem.
I don't wanna see you go
but I don't have time to solve this.
And you don't have the right
after all you put me through
I'm starting to realize.
Pressure
The Pressure I know you feel.
Pressure
The Pressure, just keep it real.
Major weed smoke in the air
pass it like you just don't care.
Have you seen my fucks to give?
I have none, I cannot live with
The Pressure
The Pressure you know I feel.
The Pressure
The Pressure to keep it real.
Pay attention to the signs.
Stay and listen, you will find
everything, ain't rocket science.
Every gem is not a diamond.
But The Pressure
The Pressure will make you feel.
The Pressure.
The Pressure.
