Inside my sheets
With the screen lighting up my face
I've got my life
Laid out in a visual space

See in the real world
These brows are not on fleek
Winged liner ain't so easy
My look is pretty weak

But here online where
I can do anything
The water's sold in boxes
And O2L can sing

Goals! Actual goals! AF

Literally, my life, is
Beaches every single night
Messy buns and Christmas lights
Literally, my life, is
Skinny waists and high fashion
Riding in the Jeep-Wagon

Literally, my life is
Literally, my life is

Ooooooh weee, I have everything - reblogged on the screen
Ooooooh weee, I have everything - reblogged on the screen

So back in real life
I still can't find a bae (shoot)
My local coffee shop
Still messes up my name (it's only three letters!)

Hey let's get lost in
One million pins and Tweets
I'll live my life like Kylie
And buy expensive sweets (gluten free)

My nails will be too long
To get done anything
I'll sip artistic lattes
And rock expensive bling

Literally, my life, is
Beaches every single night
Messy buns and Christmas lights
Literally, my life, is
Skinny waists and high fashion
Riding in the G-Wagon

Literally, my life is
Literally, my life is

Ooooooh weee, I have everything - reblogged on the screen.
Ooooooh weee, I have everything - reblogged on the screen.

Ooooooh weee, I have everything...

Literally, my life, is
Thrifting stores and hand me downs
Picking graduation gowns
Literally, my life, is
Hitting up the drive-thru
Got shotgun in Mom's Subaru
Literally, my life is
Literally, my life is
Living in my yoga pants
Shaving for the school dance
Dealing with Felicia's rants
Homework by the fridge light
Netflix dates and pillow fights
2 a.m. on a summer night
Ooooooh weee, I have everything – right in front of me
