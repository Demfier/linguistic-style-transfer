"Remember Me"

Do you remember when I fell for you
Remember when you fell for me too
Now it's hard to recognize you
Who let this stranger in my room

And how can we look at the very same moon
Whistle at the very same tune
Everything reminds me of you
Tell me you remember that too

I learned the hard way
And this is heartbreak
Where does the love go
Guess only you know

I know you watch me
Cause I still watch you
Where does the love go
Guess only you know

Do you remember
We were forever [x2]

Do you remember (Do you remember)
Do you remember (Do you remember)
Do you remember (Do you remember)

You wonder if I found another you
If I love him like I loved you
Does he touch me like you used to
Now you wish you were in his shoes

And like a rose under the summer gloom
The kisses in the afternoon
Everything reminds me of you
Tell me you remember that too

I learned the hard way
And this is heartbreak
Where does the love go
Guess only you know

I know you watch me
Cause I still watch you
Where does the love go
Guess only you know

Do you remember
We were forever [x2]

Do you remember (Do you remember)
Do you remember (Do you remember)
Do you remember (Do you remember)

Do you remember when you fell for me
Do you remember
You remember [x2]

Do you remember (Do you remember)
Do you remember (Do you remember)
Do you remember (Do you remember)
