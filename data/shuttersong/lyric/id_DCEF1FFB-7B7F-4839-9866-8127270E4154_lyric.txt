You used to be
real close to me
you always see
it all differently

You're wonderful
that's why I fall
in love with you
everytime I see you
walking through my door

I adore everything about you
it's nothing that you do
it's just you

And I know everything about you
and it feels like there's nothing I can do

I guess
everything flows
it comes as it goes

Everytime you hold my hand
I wanna kiss you on your lips
and wanna walk down your back
with my fingertips

When you lay your head on my chest
I can feel your heartbeat
pressed against mine
hoping that I'm what's on your mind
looking to find a way to make you smile
