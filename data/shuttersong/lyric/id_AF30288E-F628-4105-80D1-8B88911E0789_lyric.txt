Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me, that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear, I'm getting used to
Being held by you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave, if you keep holding me this way
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave, if you keep holding me this way
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Who's this man that's holding your hand
And talking about your eyes?
Used to sing about being free, but now he's changed his mind
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave, if you keep holding me this way

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me

Oh, baby, you've got me tied down

Oh, baby, I'll never leave, if you keep holding me this way
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All my life I've been on my own
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I used the light to guide me home
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But now together we're alone
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Baby, look what you've done
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave, if you keep holding me this way
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave, if you keep holding me this way
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me.
