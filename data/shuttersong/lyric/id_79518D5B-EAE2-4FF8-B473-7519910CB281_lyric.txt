I feel the salty waves come in
I feel them crash against my skin
& I smile as I respire
Because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV
That changes everything I see
& maybe if I continue watching

I'll lose the traits that worry me
Can we fast forward to go down on me?
Stop there, & let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
& I'll admire your expensive taste
& who cares, divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea

So catch me up, I'm getting out of here

Can we fast forward to go down on me?
Taking everything for granted

But we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion

Knowing everything is fine
& I would wait & watch the hours fall
In a hundred separate lines
But I regain repose & wonder
How I ended up inside
Can we fast forward 'til you go down on me?
Stop there, & let me correct it

I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
& I'll admire your expensive taste

& who cares, divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea

So catch me up, I'm getting out of here
Catch me up, I'm getting out of here
More to the point, I need to show
How much I can come and go

Other plans fell through
& put a heavy load on you
I know there's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead & watch me go
Go, go, oh
Stop there, & let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
& I'll admire your expensive taste
& who cares, divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up, I'm getting out of here
It's not fair, just let me perfect it
Don't wanna live a life that was comprehensive
'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up, I'm getting out of here
So catch me up, I'm getting out of here
Can we go down on me?
Can we fast forward to go down?
