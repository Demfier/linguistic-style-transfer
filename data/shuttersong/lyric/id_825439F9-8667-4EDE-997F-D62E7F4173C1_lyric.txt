Out of sight, the way you come alive when you are all alone.

Whenever you want it, wherever you want it. Anywhere you are, my love, let me comfort you,
your eyes dripping blue.

I'll be night light, looking for a sin,
You be the bright light, drive me in.
No room for doubts, so stubbornly keep on,

But for how long?

To be here alone, tonight, tonight. And I can't say no,
Not until I reap the seeds I've sown,
Not until I take that long walk home and stare you down.

Words that'll ease you,
Words that're always dressed up to please you, promise it someday,
Whispered to you, so desperately all night
Walk out the door, get rid of the tales,
We can say it's okay, but we're kidding ourselves
Trick me to think that you could be all mine.

All night, hold me.

To be here alone, tonight, tonight. Whenever you want it, wherever you want it. All the time, the way you are alone, the way you hold it all,
I, I stood, I watched you come down,
oh lord, I try and still it's not enough
