No time for haters
I see ya later
Try to put up barriers.
But I never get through the bitchy fake girls
I'm lying to them yet, I'm lying to the bed.

You know that you made it.
Like a king on my thrown
Babe you are my pride
That's when you know that you made it.
You know that you made it. ...
Pull me down cause ya jealous.
You know.
Keep ya head up to the heavens now
now they're just jealous.
You know.
Never forget all those who helped me down.
They just want me to drown.
Stronger than ever I'm holding my brown.
Who's laughing now, yeah, who's laughing now
You know that you made it
Like a king on my thrown
baby you are my pride.
That's when you know that you made it.
You know that you made it. Einde
