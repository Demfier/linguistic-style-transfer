Let's go away for a while
You and I, to a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand, anyway
Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Don't bother to pack your bags or your map
We won't need them where we're goin'
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay
Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat

We write a postcard to our friends
And family in free verse
We will write a postcard to our friends
And family in free verse
(On the road with Kerouac)
We will write a postcard to our friends
(Sheltered in his Bivouac)
And family in free verse
(On this road we'll never die)
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Let's go away for a while
You and I, to a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway
Holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
(Let's go away)
To stay, on a holiday, far away
(Let's go away, let's go away)
To stay in a heartbeat
(Let's go away)
