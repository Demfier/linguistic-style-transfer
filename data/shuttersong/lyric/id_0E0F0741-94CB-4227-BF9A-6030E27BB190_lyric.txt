It's probably what's best for you
I only want the best for you and if I'm not the best, then you're stuck
I try to sever ties and I ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts
And I just ran out of band-aids

I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can't bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Even though I know what's wrong, how can I be so sure?

If you never say what you feel, feel
I must have held your hand so tight
You didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal
Baby, I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start

'Cause you can't bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Ooohh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ooohh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

You must be a miracle worker
Swearin' up and down you can't fix what's been broken, yeah
Please don't give my hopes up, no no
Baby, tell me how could you be so cruel?
It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts
Baby, I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can't bandage the damage

You never really can fix a heart
Baby, I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can't bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Oh, no, no, no

You never really can fix a heart
Oh, no, no, no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh, oohh, oohh
Oh, oohh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You never really can fix my heart
