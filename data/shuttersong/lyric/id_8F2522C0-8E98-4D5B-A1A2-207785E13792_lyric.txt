Once upon a time I knew a man
He says run beyond the trees
To take my heart

He cuts down every branch in the forest
He would dance just to keep me safe
At the sunset in the valley
I was in the dark alone
Nor knew the time or knew where to go,
Oh oh

Once upon a time
My heart was whole
And now that everything is broke
I don't know where to go

Until I know the grey
I thought I'd love to stay
But I couldn't be more wrong

At the sunset in the valley
I was in the dark alone
Nor knew the time or knew where to go,
Oh oh
