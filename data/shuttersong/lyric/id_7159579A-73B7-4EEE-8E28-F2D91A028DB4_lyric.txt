(Sugar, spice and everything nice
These were the ingredients
These were the ingredients
These were the ingredients
Chosen to create the perfect little girls...)

CHORUS:
Me and my girls are takin' over
Ya better know
There's nothing that we can't do
When it comes to standin' up
And defendin' what's true
We do what we got to
We ain't afraid to let the world know
We got the power to change what's wrong
As long
As we're together
We're gonna stay strong
We do what have to

Ya know it ain't easy bein' a girl
'Cause so many people try to rule your world
They don't wanna give you the respect that you earned
It's like you gotta scream if you wanna be heard
But got to know within you lies
The power and strength to win the fight
And with your sisters by your side
There's nothing you can't survive

With the sugar, spice and everything nice
We got a little something
Extra
Holdin' us all together
We're takin' over

REPEAT CHORUS

'Cause the world is a crazy place
And they you you're just a pretty face
So hold on to you no matter what they say
You can't just let them convince you to throw all your dreams away
And when you think you've had enough
Remember you've got the stuff
Inside that makes you twice as tough
And you're a diamond in the rough

REPEAT CHORUS X 2

So let all your superabilities show now
Let them all know that you just refuse to bow
'Cause there's no way anyone else can hold us down
No... no... no.no...

REPEAT CHORUS TO FADE
