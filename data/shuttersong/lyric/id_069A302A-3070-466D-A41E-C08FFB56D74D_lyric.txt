I want to love you, give you that loving baby
Take you to have you, do what you like baby
I've got to find out, how you can be my lady
I've got to do things, do things to drive you crazy
We've got one chance and I want it badly

Do you feel like it's going the right way?
Do you know what you're doing inside me?
If you want that then bring that fire babe
Yeah you got me, I'm dreaming about it
If you like that then we can go round it
If you need that then tell me right now baby
'Cause I wanna know
If this is the last night

Baby let's do this right
kiss me like you mean it
If this is the last night
Baby let's do this right

I want to show you, show you that good life baby
You've got my heartbeat, beating inside me lately
I'm watching your lips move, can't hear a word you're saying

Cause I want to do things, do things that drive you crazy
We got one chance and I want it badly
Do you feel like it's going the right way?
Do you know what you're doing inside me?
If you want that then bring that fire babe
Yeah you got me, I'm dreaming about it
If you like that then we can go round it
If you need that then tell me right now baby
