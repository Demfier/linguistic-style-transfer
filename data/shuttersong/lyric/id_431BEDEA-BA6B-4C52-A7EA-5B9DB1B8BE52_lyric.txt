Children grow and women producing
And men go working
Some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
Ingle wood ingle wood ingle wood
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Yo first grade oak street elementary
A few blocks from the ingle wood cemetery
I lived through hard times
According to my memory
Then I learnt to rhyme like
I'm reading off the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso market even though
I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa's garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a cross over
Right now is just who is that girl
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded always stay grounded
Still do chose even when I'm on tour
One thing's for sure I'mma always be me
That west side becky becky becky g
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Yo what you know about that in and out lots
And what you know about that four of five drive
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me everytime
That I'm in Hollywood and wine
If you wanna take me
You gotta ask my daddy
And my thirty uncles
You can meet them in an ally
And one day I'mma bring home a grammy
But no matter
What I will be bringing home randy's
Do nuts so what holla when you seen me
I am still the same b
Even when I am on TV
Still rocking j's with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood
But not the hood put of the girl
Yea I love sushi love my calamari
But ain't no better chef
Then my very own mommy
If you can't catch me roaming in my barrio
I am with my 'litas praying the Rosario
Ingle wood ingle wood ingle wood
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so becky from the block
Always had a little but I want a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Ingle wood
