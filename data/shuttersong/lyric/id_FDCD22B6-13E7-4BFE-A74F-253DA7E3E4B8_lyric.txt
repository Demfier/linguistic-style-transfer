Riding high Empire State
Riding high and roll the dice
Decides our fate
Bottle rockets off you roof
Riding bikes through red lights
We're bulletproof
Can you blame me for just being alive
Can you blame me for just being alive
Climbing the Manhattan Bridge
Gave the finger to our city with a kiss
We got kicked out of the bar
I know I know sometimes I take things way too far
Can you blame me for just being alive
Can you blame me for just being alive
Don't blame me
Don't blame me
Don't blame me
Can you blame me for just being alive
Can you blame me for just being alive
