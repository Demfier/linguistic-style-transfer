I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time

'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh thats all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shining I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back I'm bout' to spaz

Yeah, 'bout FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try it
Ooh thats all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so selfish
But you called bout a thousand times
Wondering where I been
Now I know that your up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so reckless
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

If I go to jail tonight (uhn)
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride (uhn)
But that just ain't up for sale

See all of my kindness (uuhn uhn)
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, thats all I want
FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Thats all I want
