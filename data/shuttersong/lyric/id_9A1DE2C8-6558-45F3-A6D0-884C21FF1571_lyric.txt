When I was a young boy,

My father took me into the city

To see a marching band.
去看乐队游行
 
He said, "Son when you grow up,
他说：“儿子啊，等你长大了
would you be the savior of the broken,
你愿意成为绝望者、
the beaten and the damned?"
失败者和不幸者的救星吗？”
 
He said "Will you defeat them,
他说：“你能战胜它们吗？
your demons, and all the non-believers,
你的心魔，还有那些失去信仰的人
the plans that they have made?"

"Because one day I'll leave you,

A phantom to lead you in the summer,
化作夏日指引你的幽魂……
To join The Black Parade."
我将步入迈向死亡的游行
(Mexico friends!)

Sometimes I get the feeling

she's watching over me.
那在天之灵正守望着我
And other times I feel like I should go.
又有时我感觉自己该动身了
 
And through it all, the rise and fall,
当我穿越一切沉浮
the bodies in the streets.
以及街上的人群
And when you're gone we want you all to know.
当你离去之后，我们要让所有人知道：
 
We'll carry on, we'll carry on

We'll carry on
你会被传承下去
And in my heart I can't contain it
在我心中有什么已难以抑制
The anthem won't explain it.

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
我们会让你在千疮百孔的梦中晕头转向
Your misery and hate will kill us all.

So paint it black and take it back

On and on we carry through the fears

Ooh oh ohhhh
Disappointed faces of your peers

Ooh oh ohhhh
Take a look at me
把我放在眼里吧
cause I could not care at all
因为这些我不屑一顾
Do or die, you'll never make me
这是背水一战，你休想指使我
 
Because the world will never take my heart
因为整个世界也填不满我的雄心
Go and try, you'll never break me

Give a cheer for all the broken

Listen here, because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero

I! don't! care!

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead
and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
 
We'll carry on ...
