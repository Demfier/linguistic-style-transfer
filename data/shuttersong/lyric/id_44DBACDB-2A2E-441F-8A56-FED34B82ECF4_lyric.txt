Ooooooooooh-ooooooooooooh, ooooooooooooooooh, oh whoa

Can you feel me
When I think about me
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wander in the desert for a thousand days, ohh
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

I'm miss you so much-can't help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Oh whoa, whoa, oh whoa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me callin'
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean is running dry
Catch me I'm fallin'
It's like the ground's crumbling underneath my feet won't you save me
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh baby

I'm miss you so much-can't help it I'm in love (love)
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (side) don't know how I'll survive (how I'll survive)
A day without you is like a year without rain
Oh whoa, whoa, oh whoa

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me, stick around me
Baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here, I can't explain it
But a day without you
Is like a year without rain, oh whoa

I'm miss you so much (so much) can't help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (side) don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Oh whoa, whoa, oh whoa

Ooooooooooh, whoa, whoa, oh
