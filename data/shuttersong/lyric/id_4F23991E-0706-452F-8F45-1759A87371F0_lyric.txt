Slow is the memory
I can picture her standing right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy
And I know she wants me

I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugarcane
And sit on top of me
yelling out my fucking name
until I'm empty

But I know she wants me
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bare to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears

You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Woah, woah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we could get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax

You know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy service but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care

And the emptiness is too much to bear
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bare to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
drowned in someone else's tears

You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm scared of standing right in front of you
The way our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh

Deep down you know that
I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bare to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
I drown in someone else's tears

You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
I've already tried to explain myself
it's not that I love someone else
I can't bare to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
I drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
No, no, no, no
Yeah
Ooh, you tried, ooh
Yeah, hey!
