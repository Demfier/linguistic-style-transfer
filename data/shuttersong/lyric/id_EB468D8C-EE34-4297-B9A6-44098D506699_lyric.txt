You're like gold dust
It breaks all of me
A foreign sun that I thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust

Oh, don't change, ever
No, don't change

There's a hollow in this house whenever you go
You're like gold dust
It breaks all of me
A foreign sun my eyes thought I'd never see

You're like gold dust
Keep coming down the street

There's a hollow in this house whenever you go
Oh, don't change, ever
No, don't change
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go
Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go
You're like gold dust
It breaks all of me
A foreign sun my eyes thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust
Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go
Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go
