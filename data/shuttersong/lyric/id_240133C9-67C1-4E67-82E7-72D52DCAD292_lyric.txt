Bad Blood - Nao
You've had a holiday
A glass of ocean slipping down
My friend denied my hopes and dreams
Aftermath no fees no grips I'm free
I worship you like holy days
Lying on my back and see
Clouds and rays
Drinking lime bitter from a lemonade
White horses merry time won't do
Do you remember the holiday slipped away
Time and place
I took a different member
Lying on my back and see
Clouds and rays
But dreaming
The feelings rule
Forever we're young
Pages unsung
Ooh-oh
I felt that you remember dreaming
Of a past that couldn't last
But now we're changing
Reframing in
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad blood
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad blood
Do you remember the riding the passion the falling
Oh it's dripping on ice
Sharing it vice
Taking it twice
But later let's not forget the
Silent day stripped away
Time and place
You choose not to remember
Fly away counting days
I'm hiding from you uuh
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad blood
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad blood
I choose for the rain not to fall
Exposing the sun on you
I lose
Don't tell me I good girl I know
And it's mad when we're close oh
I choose
My head's now a float
But my heart's stranding pulse of you
I lose
Don't tell me I'm c-co-co-cool
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad blood
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad blood
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad blood
I think it is the know that is the
I think it is the bad bad
