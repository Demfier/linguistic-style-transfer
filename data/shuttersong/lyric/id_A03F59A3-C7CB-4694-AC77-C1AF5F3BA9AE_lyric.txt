First sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's giving me, every thing will be okay
Sometimes when I wake up, and I'm wondering
How my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out, every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing

Blessed I need you
Blessed Oh yeah
Blessed Every time
Blessed Oh hey
(I'm blessed) Oh hey
(I'm blessed) I'm blessed
(I'm blessed) So blessed
