All the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart
Oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying
Oh my oh, well no I ain't!

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be moving on

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she like's everyone
And I don't like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
And now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be moving on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she like's everyone
And I don't like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Instrumental

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I fear nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
