Hey, you got me woke up
The way you roll that
Sticky like okra
Just let me coach ya
Show you 'bout my coacher
It's the late night show like Oprah
Ditch the party, it ain't over
Don't ham it, and grab your friend by the hand
Let me know is you down
Body like me play at ya
I might make that fly at ya
How we'll know if you don't play fair?!
But I think of you and your girl
Just gimme some of that!

We stand, out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We're gone delirious
Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We're gone delirious
La la la la la la
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
We're gone delirious!
La la la la la la
Come and take a ride
¡°
Take it all night, who cares?!
¡ª Steve Aoki, Chris Lake, Tujamo feat. Kid Ink
Take it all night, who cares?!

We on sunset into the sun up
I got my girls here
Where?! So don't you run up
It could get ugly
Think I need a wing man
I'm straight from California, smelling like the weed man
La la la la la la
I got a lighter, so go and take that hip deep
One, drip send for the fifth
Girl, I ain't seen nothing
I plead the fifth!
Make your make seize to resist

All this money make no sense, you scared!
Gimme some of that!

Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We're gone delirious
Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We're gone delirious
La la la la la la
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
We're gone delirious!

La la la la la la
Come and take a ride
Take it all night, who cares?!

Everybody out!

Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We're gone delirious
Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up

Come into my arms, come into my arms
You say that I'm DELIRIOUS
Oh, you'll just have to learn the hard way
I love the pain, I love the game
(You'll just have to learn the hard way)
Come into my arms, come into my arms
(You'll just have to learn the hard way)
You say that I'm DELIRIOUS
(You'll just have to learn the hard way)
But I'm not the one holding the gun
