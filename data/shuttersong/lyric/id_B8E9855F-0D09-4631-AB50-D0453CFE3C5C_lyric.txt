It's late in the evening
Glass on the side, I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here, we, we wish they would disappear, so
Maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program

I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time, lady
I need you, darling, come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling, won't you let me know

Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
If you love me come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Oh oh ooh ooh
Oh oh ooh ooh

Sing!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh louder!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh sing!

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This love is a blaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days

Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know but something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed, singing we found love in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say but I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila


I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Sobering up we just sit on the couch, one thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth
I need you, darling, come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling, won't you let me know
Oh oh ooh ooh
Oh oh ooh ooh
If you love me come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Oh oh ooh ooh
Oh oh ooh ooh
Sing!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh louder!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh sing!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling
Before the beat kicks in again

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!
I need you, darling, come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling, won't you let me know
Oh (Louder!) oh ooh ooh
Oh oh ooh ooh
Sing!
If you love me come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Oh (Louder!) oh ooh ooh
Oh oh ooh ooh
Sing!
