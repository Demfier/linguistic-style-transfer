I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things he didn't understand
Oh, then I let him go.
Now, there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I make my getaway.

1-2-3 they're gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that can never got to keep
1-2-3 they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna to leave.

My Ex's & Oh's
They haunt me
Like gho-o-sts, they want me
To make them all
They won't let go
Ex's & Oh's.

I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept it warm in the winter, left them frozen in the spring
My, my, how the season goes by.
I get high and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking and the heads just roll
You know, that's how the story goes.

1-2-3 they're gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that can never got to keep
1-2-3 they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna to leave.

My Ex's & Oh's
They haunt me
Like gho-o-sts, they want me
To make them all
They won't let go
Ex's & Oh's.

My Ex's & Oh's
They haunt me
Like gho-o-sts, they want me
To make them all
They won't let go
Ex's & Oh's.

1-2-3 they're gonna run back to me
Climbin' over mountains and sailin' over seas
1-2-3 they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave.

My Ex's & Oh's
They haunt me
Like gho-o-sts, they want me
To make them all
They won't let go
Ex's & Oh's.
My Ex's & Oh's
They haunt me
Like gho-o-sts, they want me
To make them all
They won't let go
Ex's & Oh's.
