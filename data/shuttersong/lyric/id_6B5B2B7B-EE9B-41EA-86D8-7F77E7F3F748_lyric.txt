You've got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen
I was told
That I would feel nothing the first time
I don't know

How these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be

If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light,

Don't let it go out
And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, song for someone
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You break and enter my imagination

Whatever's in there it's yours to take
I was told I'd feel nothing the first time
You were slow to heal but this could be the night
If there is a light you can't always see

And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without

And there is a light, don't let it go out
And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, this is a song for someone
And I'm a long long way
from your Hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way
from where I was and where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out
