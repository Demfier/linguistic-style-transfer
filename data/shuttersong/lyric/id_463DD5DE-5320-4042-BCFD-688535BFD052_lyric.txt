The light shines down half my face
You see a smile but on the other side there is the rage
You said we are the moon
but you were wrong I'm the dark side
Now you know it's not the truth
People don't change
but reveal themselves baby
Maybe it's too late
It's too late for turning back
You think it's still the same
I can't live in the past baby
Maybe it's too late, yeah
It's too late for turning back

Runaway while you can
Everything is coming to an end
Please don't swear and
This story cannot begin again
Runaway while you can
Everything is coming to an end
Please don't swear and

This story cannot begin again

You make reason prevail
Nobody has told me where is the right way
I said I'd never leave you
Even if you pretend
Now you know it's not the truth
People don't change
but reveal themselves, baby
Maybe it's too late
It's too late for turning back

Runaway while you can
Everything is coming to an end
Please don't swear and
This story cannot begin again
Runaway while you can

Everything is coming to an end

Please don't swear and
This story cannot begin again

You can't see me inside my head
Through my eyes you can no more

I can not pretend the fear of
Not being strong the fear of
Being alone
But faces change
See it happen everything is done
How many, so many, too many words trashed
Everyone pretend to be interested, well
Now I'm asking myself
