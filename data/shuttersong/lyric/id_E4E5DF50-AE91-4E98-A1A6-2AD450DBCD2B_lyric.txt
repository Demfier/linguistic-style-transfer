Feel the Light - Jennifer Lopez
Here I go
Here I go
Feel better now
Feel better now
Here I go
Here I go
It's better now
Feel better now
Do you remember when we fell under
Did you expect me to reason with thunder
I still remember when time was frozen
What seemed forever was just a moment
Hurry up  hurry up
There's no more waiting
We're still worth saving
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Here I go
Here I go
Feel better now
Feel better now
Here I go
Here I go
It's better now feel better now
I sill remember when things were broken
But put together the cracks were closing
Hurry up  hurry up
There's no more waiting
We're still worth saving
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
You and I can have it all tonight
So let's bring it back to life
Now we have another chance to fly
Another chance to make you right
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Here we go
Here we go
Feel better now feel better now
Here we go
Here we go
It's better now feel better now
