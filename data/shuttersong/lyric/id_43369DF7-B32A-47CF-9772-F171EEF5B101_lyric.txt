Feelin' so confused
You dont know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does and hasnt lost your trust
Who could that be knocking at her door

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says shes true
So you start comin' too

Just as that old knockin' comes to stay
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
