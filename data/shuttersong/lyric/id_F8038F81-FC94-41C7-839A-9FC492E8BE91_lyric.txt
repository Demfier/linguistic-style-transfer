Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge?
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands

I take a look up in the sky and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy,
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red

Please, won't you push me for the last time?
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fucking fun
You want a martyr?
I'll be one, because enough's enough, we're done

The thing I think I love will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up, pubescent drama queen
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late

Please, won't you push me for the last time?
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fucking fun
You want a martyr?
I'll be one, because enough's enough, we're done

You told me think about it, well I did
Now I don't want to feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want,
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

Imagine living like a king someday,
A single night without a ghost in the walls
We are the shadows screaming, take us now
We'd rather die than live to rest on the ground

Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me,
Now this is war

Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me,
Now this is war

You told me think about it, well I did
Now I don't want to feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want,
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

Imagine living like a king someday,
A single night without a ghost in the walls
We are the shadows screaming, take us now
We'd rather die than live to rest on the ground
