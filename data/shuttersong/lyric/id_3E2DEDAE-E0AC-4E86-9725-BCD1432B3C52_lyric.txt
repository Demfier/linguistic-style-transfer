I hope you know he's the wrong one
I hope you know he's the last one fighting for ya
I hope you know he's been dead wrong
I hope you see that in time you'll question every tear that you spare
Is it really worth fightin' for?
And all the pain that you bare
Is it really worth tryin' for?
Cuz he's got you falling so much deeper
And running the thoughts that come between ya
And I hate to see your fire fading
I hope you don't mind what i'm saying
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest
Let me be honest
mhmmmm
I'm just being honest
yeah you deserve someone that's honest

yeah you deserve someone that's honest

I hope you find out what's been missing
I hope you get the chance to find yourself again
I hope you find the strength to leave him oh
I hope you see that in time you'll question
Every tear that you spare
Is it really worth fightin' for?
And all the pain that you bare
Is it really worth tryin' for?
Cuz he's got you falling so much deeper
And running the thoughts that come between ya
And I hate to see your fire fading
I hope you don't mind what I'm saying
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest
Let me be honest
mhmmmm
I'm just being honest
yeah you deserve someone that's honest

yeah you deserve someone that's honest
I hope you find out whats been missing
I hope you get the chance to find yourself again
I hope you find the strength to leave him
