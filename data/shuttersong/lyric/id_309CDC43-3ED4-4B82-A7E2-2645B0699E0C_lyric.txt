When it went down
It was so hard to breathe
I gave up everything
In a slow fall down to the floor
Life was escaping me
I couldn't find myself
Till it was all lost
Not anymore

I'm holding on to all the pieces of my heart's debris
Till it's time
I'll, I'll pull it together and fix myself eventually
I know it's mine

I found gold in the wreckage
Put it on a necklace
Keepin' it 'cause I-I-I, I know that it's mine
I wear it like a message
So I don't forget it
Keepin' it 'cause I-I-I, I know that it's mine

I know that it's mine no matter what I do
I know that it's mine whether I win or lose
And even though my heart needs to take it's time
I know that it's mine, I know that it's mine

Facing the change
But it's still tough to see
At first I fought it all
I was so mean
I'm still unsure
How it's supposed to be
But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
Until I learn

I'm holding on to all the pieces of my heart's debris
Till it's time
I'll, I'll pull it together and fix myself eventually
I know it's mine

I found gold in the wreckage
Put it on a necklace
Keepin' it 'cause I-I-I, I know that it's mine
I wear it like a message
So I don't forget it
Keepin' it 'cause I-I-I, I know that it's mine

I know that it's mine no matter what I do
I know that it's mine whether I win or lose
And even though my heart needs to take it's time
I know that it's mine, I know that it's mine

I found gold in the wreckage
Put it on a necklace
Keepin' it 'cause I-I-I, I know that it's mine
I wear it like a message
So I don't forget it
Keepin' it 'cause I-I-I, I know that it's mine
I know that it's mine no matter what I do
I know that it's mine whether I win or lose
And even though my heart needs to take it's time
I know that it's mine, I know that it's mine
