Shorty said she wants to run away
Says I look like a boy she used to date
Took me by the hand and pulled me to the stairs
(I'm not interested, girl)
Put her tongue all up in my ear (Gross)
Almost made me spill my beer (Oh shit)
She's up and ready to go,
But I don't care (Pshh, whatever)
'Cause I'm in the zone, turn off my phone
I've got my own agenda
I feel like dancin' tonight
I'm gonna party like it's my civil right
(Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare, Oh!
'Cause I feel like dancin' tonight
Everybody getting kinda crunk
I think some dude just grabbed my junk (Whoa)
And now I know how Ke$ha must be feeling
(Like, what if we're the aliens?)
Bros try to turn me upside-down (Down)
Put a keg top to my mouth (Yo, wait, wait)
But that's okay; I'm dancing on the ceiling
'Cause I've got the groove, I'll bust a move
Just try and stop me
I feel like dancin' tonight
I'm gonna party like it's my civil right
(Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare, oh
'Cause I feel like dancin' tonight
Somebody call the police
I think they're coming to get me, they said
"You've got the right to remain on the dance floor
So show us what you've got
'Cause you know that you've got more"
I feel like dancin' tonight
I came to party like it's my civil right
(Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare, Oh!
'Cause I feel like dancin' tonight
(Oh, one more time)
I feel like dancin' tonight (I feel like dancin')
I'm gonna party like it's my civil right (Whoa, oh)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare, Oh!
'Cause I feel like dancin' tonight
Oh, oh, whoa
I feel like dancin' tonight
