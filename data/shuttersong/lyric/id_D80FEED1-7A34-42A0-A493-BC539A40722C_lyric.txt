We get high
Don't come down
Free your mind
Dream out loud

Pass me the blunt I'ma mash that
Dabbin' the pussy I'll wax that
Give me the check and I'll cash that
Write it all off I don't tax that
Write it all off I don't tax that
Get in the zone, feeling so on
Sipping patron, all by my lone
And its been known, that I'm a freak
Suckers ain't on the same level as me
I'm in a box and y'all kicking me out
Thinking that side might end in the clouds.
Feeling so major but not in the league
Not slowing it down, don't show our fatigue
Not slowing down, not slowing down
Pass me the loud, pass me the loud
Pass me the light and I'll teach ya
Listen real close to the speaker
You is already one up on society if you puffing on a reefer.
They said I couldn't make it there, into another galaxy
But I think I made it there, I wish you could come and see

I'm in my own state of mind

I'm in my, I'm in my own state of mind
I'm in my, I'm in my own state of mind
I'm in my, I'm in my own state of mind
Caught in the moment
I call it Maloski
Like you can not hold me
I'm feeling like Kobe
My peoples they told me
That no one does know me

So go get the bread for the homie
Go get the bread

Is that what they said?
Is that what they put in your head?
'Cause I'm feeling wavy like I'm in the navy
I'm swimming around in the meds
Feeling loose off the juice
I'm riding caboose
In the back of a wagon
I know they see me
But I don't feel eyes
I feel the skies
I feel like time is the sky
We watching it fly
Ticking away till we die
Wondering why
We end up this high
Feeling the vibe
I'm feeling the vibe
What is time if it ain't what you make it?
What is criticism if you don't take it?
Whats a smile if sometimes you don't fake it?
Whats the weed here for if we don't bake it?
What is time if it ain't what you make it?
