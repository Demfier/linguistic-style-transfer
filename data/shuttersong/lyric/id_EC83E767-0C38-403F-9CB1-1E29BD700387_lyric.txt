Written by：Matthew James Aiken/Peter Alan Waterman|Mike Stock
Were no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitments what I'm thinking of
You wouldnt get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how  I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up  never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry  never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Weve known each other for so long
Your hearts been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know whats been going on
We know the game and were gonna play it
And if you ask me how  I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up  never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry  never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up  never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry  never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
(Ooh give you up)
(Ooh give you up)
(Ooh) never gonna give  never gonna give  give you up
(Ooh) never gonna give  never gonna give  give you up
Weve known each other for so long
Your hearts been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know whats been going on
We know the game and were gonna play it
I just wanna tell you how  I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up  never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry  never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up  never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry  never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up  never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry  never gonna say goodbye
