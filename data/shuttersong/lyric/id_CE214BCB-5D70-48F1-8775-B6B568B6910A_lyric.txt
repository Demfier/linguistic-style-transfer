Kick the dust up
All week long it's a farming town, they're making that money grow

Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road

They take one last lap around

That sun up high goes down
and that song come on girl kick it on back, Z71 like a Cadillac
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a four door burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out, baby watch your step now, better have your boots on.

Kick the dust up

back it on up
fill your cup up

Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up.
Bar downtown they got a line of people way out the door.

10 dollar drinks, it's packed inside, I don't know what they're waiting for.
Got me a jar full of ‘Clear, and I got that music for your ears
And it's like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where there ain't nobody

We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a four door burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out, baby watch your step now, better have your boots on.
Kick the dust up

let's back it on up
fill your cup up
Lets tear it up up
And kick the dust up.
Come on
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge y'all be glad you did.
Kick it
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party.
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a four door burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out, baby watch your step now. Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up (Kick The Dust Up)
Back it on
fill your cup up
That's what's up up
Let's kick the dust up.
