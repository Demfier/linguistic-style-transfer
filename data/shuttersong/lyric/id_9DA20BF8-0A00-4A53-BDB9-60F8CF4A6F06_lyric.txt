There's fire in the dark
I can feel the heat
Like it's burning right in front of me
Don't have to see it to believe it
We could play it safe
Avoid the battle lines
There's always gonna be another fight
But as long as we got this love

I know we're gonna triumph
Yeah, yeah
We're golden when we light up
Yeah, yeah
It's just a matter of time
Before we're gonna triumph, triumph

Yeah, yeah

Nothing can stop us now
Our feet already left the ground
We're so close I can almost taste the victory
In my teeth

I can be anything with you next to me, woah
But as long as we got this love

I know we're gonna triumph
Yeah, yeah
We're golden when we light up
Yeah, yeah
It's just a matter of time
Before we're gonna triumph, triumph
Yeah, yeah
Long as we got

Long as we got this love
We're gonna triumph, triumph
Yeah, yeah

We're going faster, getting higher
Making the non-believers liars
Nothing can kill our fire

Nooo oh oh oh
We're going faster, getting higher
Making the non-believers liars
Nothing can kill our fire

I know we're gonna triumph
Yeah, yeah
We're golden when we light up
Yeah, yeah
It's just a matter of time
Before we're gonna triumph, triumph
Yeah, yeah
I know we're gonna triumph
Yeah, yeah
We're golden when we light up
Yeah, yeah
It's just a matter of time
Before we're gonna triumph, triumph
Yeah, yeah
