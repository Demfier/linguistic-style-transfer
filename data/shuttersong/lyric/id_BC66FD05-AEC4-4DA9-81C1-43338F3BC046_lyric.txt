Ever since I've known you
I swear it never crossed my mind
This feeling so brand new and I can't seem to make it right
Just need to know baby
When I'm standing on the edge

I can't get rid of this feeling
I can't stop thinking bout you

My girl
Could you be
My girl my girl my girl
Could you be
My girl my girl my girl

There's something in the rear-view
I can't say how much I want you
I keep holding my head high
When I'm standing on the edge

I can't get rid of this feeling
I can't stop thinking bout you

My girl
Could you be
My girl my girl my girl
Could you be
My girl my girl my girl

And I wish that I could take you there
And show you
When nothing else is in the way
Let me show you show you
