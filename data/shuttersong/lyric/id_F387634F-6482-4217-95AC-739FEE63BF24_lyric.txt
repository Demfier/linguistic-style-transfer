2Virgins, let's get it

Club stay jumping like whoo
Throwing haters off like whoo
She working them hips like whoo
Bring fresh new whip like whoo
Club, club stay jumping like whoo

Like whoo, like this is pool
Dropped out of school, still with the same crew
Young but no debut, get, get head like shampoo
Girls attach like glue, got a girl, let's make it two
Check it, panoramic view, I'm blessed, a-achoo
Them pretty girls pull through, they don't know what they into
Hit it once then I'm through, we kick it like a womb
Got a flow like a restroom, whoo

Club stay jumping like whoo
Throwing haters off like whoo
She working them hips like whoo
Bring fresh new whip like whoo
Club, club stay jumping like whoo

Throwing haters off like whoo
She working them hips like whoo
Bring fresh new whip like whoo
Club, club stay jumping like whoo
It's a party y'all, wa-wait, where's the alcohol?

I party like it's Mardi Gras, she give me brain, she's a know-it-all
Taking shots but it's not basketball, g-got a flow like a bathroom stall
Oh, no \
