All the feels you feel
hide away from me
but every time you let me see that smile on your face,
it's clear to me

You laugh just to laugh
runaway from everything
you hate what you have
so you hide everything
I can see that,
bet you don't know
when you look down
it really shows
i like what you have
'cause you have everything
'cause you have everything

It's not so hard to see
who you wanna be
and i don't care,
'cause i know that this feeling's in the air
and no one can compare

You laugh just to laugh
runaway from everything
you hate what you have
so you hide everything
I can see that, bet you don't know
when you look down it really shows
i like what you have
'cause you have everything
'cause you have everything

i don't really can forget
so tell me now
do you feel the same?
you don't have to runaway
'cause i'm around
girl I made this day
You laugh just to laugh
runaway from everything
you hate what you have
so you hide everything
I can see that, bet you don't know
when you look down it really shows
i like what you have
'cause you have everything
'cause you have everything
'cause you have everything
