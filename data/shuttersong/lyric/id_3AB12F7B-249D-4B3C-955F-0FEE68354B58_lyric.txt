I always drive
Always I drive so
To see you
Make me hate this whole town

Where it isn't it is
Where it isn't it is

You're whole town is
So strange
Never, never gonna change
You're connected to
Another man's connected to you

Where it isn't it is
Where it isn't it is

Please come back to me
So alone out here
I could wait for you
My life for you could come one day

Where it isn't it is
Where it isn't it is
Where it isn't it is
Where it isn't it is
