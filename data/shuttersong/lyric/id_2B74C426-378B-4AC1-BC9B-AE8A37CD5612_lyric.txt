When I needed you the most, I needed you
When I needed you the most, I needed you, the most
Now I won't be there to give you what you need
Now I won't be there, no

Spent three whole days, on cocaine
Haven't slept, awake, ain't eat a thing
But you've been on my mind this whole time

And one of these things that you told me
Is never forget, you'll never be lonely
And I know that, and I know now
Fact is...

When I needed you the most, I needed you
When I needed you the most, I needed you, the most
Now I won't be there to give you what you need
Now I won't be there, no

You know this was never really about us
And everything was always 'bout you
You never knew a thing about trust
And I knew everything about you, what's happening
Three whole years, they can go by
In a blink of an eye, and you won't know it, but
What a damn waste of time

When I needed you the most, I needed you
When I needed you the most, I needed you, the most
Now I won't be there to give you what you need
Now I won't be there, no

Spent three whole days, on cocaine
Haven't slept, awake, ain't eat a thing
But you've been on my mind this whole time

Tell you that you're doing it right when you're doing it wrong
You're doing it right when you're doing it wrong
I can't lie no more...
Yeah...
