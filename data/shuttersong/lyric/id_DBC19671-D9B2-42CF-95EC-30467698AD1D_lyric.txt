once i was a selfish fool who never understood

never looked inside myself

though on the outside i looked good

then we met and you make me the man i am today

tracy i am in love with you no matter what you weigh

`cause without love life is like the season with no summer

without love life is rock and roll without the drummer

tracy i will be yours forever

`cause i never wanna be without love

oh tracy never set me free

no i ain't lying

never set me free

tracy no no no~

living in the ghetto black is everywhere u go

who'd've thought i've loved a girl whose skin was white as winter snow

in my ivory tower life was just a hostess snack

but naw i've tasted the chocolate

and i'm never going back

`cause without love life is like the beat hat you can't follow

without love life is doris day at the apollo

darling i'll be yours forever cause i never wanna be

without love

so darling never set me free

no i'm yours forever never set me free

no no no

if i'm left without my baby doll i don;t know what i'll do

link i've got to break out so that i can get my hands on you

girl if i can't touch you the i'm gonna lose control

seaweed you'r my black white knight

i've found my blue eye soul

sweet freedom is our goal

trace i wanna kiss ya

let me out the next toll

without love life is like a prom that won't invite us

without love it's like my big break and laryngitis

without love life is a 45 that you can't buy it

without love life is like my mother on a diet

like a week that's only mondays

only ice-cream,never sundaes

like a circle with no center

like a door marked do not enter

darling i'll be yours forever

`cause i never wanna be

without love

yes now you've captured me

without love

i surrender happily

without love

oh seaweed never set me free

i ain't lying

never set me free

no no no

no i don't wanna live without love love love

pretty penny little

darling you had best believed me

never leave me without love
