Oh what a day is today
Nothing can stand in my way
Now that you shipped on from under my skin
I think I'm ready to win
Oh what a night is tonight
I think I'm ready to fight
Now that my broken bones
All have been healed
I think I'm starting to feel
Something good something good
Now that you're gone
Well I can roll on to something good
Oh what a way that we die
Plenty of tears were supplied
My eyes are rung out and dry as a bone
And I taste much better alone
Something good something good
Now that you're gone
Well I can roll on to something good
Oh you know I moved away
From the other side of the door
Now I don't have to wait anymore
For you to come home
Something good
Now that you're gone
Well I can roll on to something good
Something good
