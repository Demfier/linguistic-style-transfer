Pop that, pop that, bet she do it for the gang, yeah
Gang, yeah, do it for the gang, yeah, gang yeah

Two blunts, now she's double jointed
Neighbours ask what the fucking noise is
Nothing man, that's just fucking noises
Oh, you know it's good if you cum that quick
And if she tie her hair back she ‘bout to suck that dick
Killed the game then went Casper
Been making bands, I'm the X Factor

Hit the kitty cat, ain't no brakes
Minus your clothes then get a takeaway
Watch the chest, I'm Flavor Flav
Cause she got some big titties
Wife hoes, you ain't serious
Bought her hills, you hilarious
White whip, red interiors

She said she saw me on the MOBOs, tell her go low
Got it all on the Gopro
(When she slow-mo
For the gang wearing no clothes)
Saying she in love with the coco
What you mean, you can't twerk?
Tattoo on your arse, you better show me how that art work
You want the D? You better ask first
She see them blue ticks, now I can't swerve
Walk in, I'm like, \
