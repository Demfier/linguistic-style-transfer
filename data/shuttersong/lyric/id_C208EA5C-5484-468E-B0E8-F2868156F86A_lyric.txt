Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.

No Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean,
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen.
I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day.
Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
you ain't got no money you just ain't no good.
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

Yeah yeah yeah

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road
And don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more.
