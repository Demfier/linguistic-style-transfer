 Missed calls and ignored texts and
Late night, I'm stayin' up stressin'
Girl I got you on my mind
I swear this happens every time (yeah)
But what about our last fight?
Yeah I know it happened last night
You can put that in the past right?
I'm just tryna' live the fast life (uh)
 And what's love without trust girl?
 And what's love without lust girl?
I've been thinkin' bout us girl
I've been thinkin' bout
So what do we do now?
Everything we built, we broke it
It's all shattered  and broken
I can't get you outta my head
Its all fallin' down
Time that we get goin'
Things you never told me
I thought you were the one
Yeah I thought you were the one
But I guess things change
No it's nothin' with the fame
Girl, I swear it's all the same
There's a difference in interest
I feel it when we're kissin'
One day, you're here
 And the next day, you're missin' (uh)
Can we be consistent? (girl)
Are you even listenin'? (yeah)
Got me feelin' so distant
I'll be gone in an instant
So what do we do now?
Everything we built, we broke it
It's all shattered  and broken
I can't get you outta my head
It's all fallin' down
Time that we get goin'
Things you never told me

Really I wanna know
Lookin' at you in the eyes
Even though mine are kinda low
 And it's easy to see
That something is hurting you so
Bad I know that
The rhythm  and flow that
I'm putting on this slow track
Are gonna make you so sad
At least I can say for the time
I was satisfied
Answering machine
Hearing your name
Next to mine
So what do we do now?
Everything we built, we broke it
It's all shattered  and broken
I can't get you outta my head
It's all fallin' down
Time that we get goin'
Things you never told me

So what do we do now?
Everything we built, we broke it
