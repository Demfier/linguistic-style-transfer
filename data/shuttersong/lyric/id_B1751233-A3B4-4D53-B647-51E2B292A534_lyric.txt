I turned tables and speak too softly
I don't make much sense, I don't make much sense
You're unable to come down lightly
You're so intense, yeah you're so intense

So, you just let me know that you miss it
Come take the paddle strong
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping,
but come home.

You and I, we want too many waterparks
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, on different boats, we sail the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
When it comes to us

Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us

You're too playful, and never serious
But I love you that way, yeah I love that way
I'm too careful and always in a rush
But it's all ok, yeah it's always ok

So, you just let me know that you miss it
Come take the paddle strong
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping,
but come home.

You and I, we want too many waterparks
It really shouldn't work but it does

And side by side, on different boats, we sail the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
When it comes to us

Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
