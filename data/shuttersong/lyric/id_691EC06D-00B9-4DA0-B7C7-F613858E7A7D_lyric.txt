This goes out to you, this is dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day

When you walk by, the sun shine

It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky

And everything on you intoxicates

It's a mystery
I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign

But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it's pure just by the taste
And you kiss me
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away
Far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste

Go to waste
Don't ever change your flavour cause I love the taste
Love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavour is so original

And it all started when she said
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum
You really got me when you said

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Popping that Strawberry Bubblegum

This goes out to you
This goes out to you
So tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting all professional, but it works out
You shouldn't wanna work here anyway
And baby I, I

Girl, I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me, that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way
Tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away

Far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste
Go to waste
Don't ever change your flavour, cause I love the taste

Love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way
Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before

And baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavor is so original
And it all started when she said
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Popping that Strawberry Bubblegum
My little Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum
My little Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum
She's my little Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum
My little Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum

Hey, hey, hey, hey
My little
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Come in
Sit down
Let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want
Now, my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers
