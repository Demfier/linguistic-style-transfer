She walks around town with that pretty smile on her face. (Yeah)
I'm running in circles, this girl she loves the thrill of the chase.
My heart skips a beat when she's here next to me, but I don't know what to say. (Don't know what to say)
This feeling of love, which is sent from above, gotta tell you here today.
I've been waiting for her all my life. So close, does she feel it?
She's always been by here just next door.

She makes me feel alive, alive, a-a-alive,
Alive, alive, she's the girl next door, yeah.
Alive, alive, a-a-alive,
Alive, alive, she's the girl, she's the girl next door.

(Yeah)

She talks about us like it's happening when it ain't.
I'm wishing she'd see me for more than somebody to play.
It's hard to imagine what life would be like if I let you slip away. (Let you slip away)
I'm not giving up on this love between us, gotta tell you here today.
I've been waiting for her all my life. So close, does she feel it?
She's always been by here, just next door.

She makes me feel alive, alive, a-a-alive,
Alive, alive, she's the girl next door, yeah.

Alive, alive, she's the girl, she's the girl next door, yeah.
Alive, alive, a-a-alive,
Alive, alive, she's the girl, she's the girl next door.

She's walking away, walking away from me. From me.
It's getting hotter each day and harder to say I need ya.
