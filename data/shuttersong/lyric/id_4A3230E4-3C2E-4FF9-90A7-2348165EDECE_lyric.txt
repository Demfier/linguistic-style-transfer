I never met you, but I know you're out there
If I cross the oceans, would you be there?
A stranger's eyes, that somehow look familiar
I know that when it's you, I remember

So wait for me, I swear I'll find you
Climbing every wall that hides you
I know we, we're meant for something better

So wait for me, the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I, we're meant for something better
Better ohohohoh

I swear I'll find you
i feel the wind move, you breathe the same air
you like the best news that i cant share
A stranger's eyes, that somehow look familiar

I know that when it's you, I remember
So wait for me, I swear I'll find you
Climbing every wall that hides you

I know we, we're meant for something better
So wait for me, the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I, we're meant for something better

Better ohohohoh

Ohohohohohoh
So wait for me, the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I, we're meant for something better
Better ohohohoh
I swear I'll find you
Ohohohohohoh
We're meant for something better
Better ohohohoh
