I just want a lover
Nothing that is complicated
I don't want to know you
We don't have to talk about it

Let us both discover
There is nothing better than just
Lying here together
Staring out the bedroom window

I just want a lover
Could you be the person for me?
Nothing sentimental
I want you to satisfy me

I just want a lover
To take away the pain
I just want a lover
To fool around again

Friday seems so easy, Saturday is hard
I just want a lover
To ease my broken heart
Ease my broken heart

I just want a lover
Let me hear your body talking
Don't have to imagine
All the things we'd do together

Caught under the covers
Bodies heat direct feeling
You don't want to know me
Staring out the bedroom window

I just want a lover, I just want a lover
I just want a lover

I just want a lover
To take away the pain
I just want a lover
To fool around again

Friday seems so easy, Saturday is hard
I just want a lover
To ease my broken heart
Ease my broken heart

I just want a lover, I just want a lover
I just want a lover

I just want a lover
Nothing that is complicated
I don't want to know you
We don't have to talk about it

Let us both discover
There is nothing better than just
Lying here together
Staring out the bedroom window
