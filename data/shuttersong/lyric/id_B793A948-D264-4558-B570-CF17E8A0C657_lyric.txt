Can you see it?
The worst is over
The monsters in my head are scared of love
Fallen people
listen up!
It's never too late to change our luck

So, don't let them steal your light
E eh eh eh
Don't let them break your stride
E eh eh eh
There is light on the other side
And you see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution
And Well Make it out tonight

It's a revolution

Can you see it?
The worst is over

The monsters in my head are scared of love
Fallen people
listen up!
It's never too late to change our luck

So, don't let them steal your light
E eh eh eh
Don't let them break your stride
E eh eh eh
There is light on the other side
And you see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution
And well Make it out tonight
It's a revolution
It's a reva
Can you see it
Oh oh, ooo oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, ooo oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, ooo oh, oh oh oh
