I don't mind you telling me

what's been on your mind lately

I don't mind you speaking up

 

I know sometimes I can be

all wrapped up and into me

I can be in such a rush

 

Just slow me down, slow me down

Tell me tomorrow everything will be around

 

Just slow me down, slow me down

 

You're the one who keeps me on the ground

 

Baby, you can be tough

Say enough is enough

 

You can even be blunt

 

Just do it with love, love, love

You can tell me I'm wrong

That I'm coming on way too strong

Don't think I'd be crushed

 

Just do it with love, love, love, love

 

Just do it with love, love, love, love

 

Just do it with love.

 

I can take your honesty,

all your words weigh heavenly

Listening to you all the time

 

I wanna be there for you,

the way you've been there for me

Always help me walk the line

 

And slow me down, slow me down

 

I know you will always be around

 

Baby, you can be tough

 

Say enough is enough

 

You can even be blunt

 

Just do it with love, love, love

You can tell me I'm wrong

That I'm coming on way too strong

Don't think I'd be crushed

 

Just do it with love, love, love, love

 

All this trying to find we know each other

 

Now that I've been leaning on your shoulder

 

I can tell you baby that

You're right, you're right

You're wrong, you're wrong

And I can't believe people know your song

 

Baby, you can be tough

 

Say enough is enough

 

You can even be blunt

 

Just do it with love, love, love

You can tell me I'm wrong

That I'm coming on way too strong

Don't think I'd be crushed

 

Just do it with love, love, love, love

Baby, you can be tough

Say enough is enough

 

You can even be blunt

 

Just do it with love, love, love

You can tell me I'm wrong

 

That I'm coming on way too strong

Don't think I'd be crushed

Just do it with love, love, love, love

 

Just do it with love, love, love, love

 

Just do it with love.

 

Just do it with love, love, love, love

 

Just do it with love.
