I gotta slow down

Stop for a second
Take a look around
And I gotta take time

To hear that little voice inside
Saying I came to give you life

So spread your wings and fly
I've got a secret to share
You are enough to change the atmosphere
So go and do life big

I wanna do life big
Break out them blue skies

I can feel my heart beating inside
Yeah, it's like a new day
Woke up to hear You say
I came to give you life

So spread your wings and fly
Now go and show no fear
You are enough to change the atmosphere
So go and do life big

I wanna do life big
Oh, I wanna love, wanna give every day I live

I wanna do life big
I wanna love, serve, and give every chance I get
I wanna do life big
Oh, I wanna love, wanna give every day I live
I wanna do life big
I wanna love, serve, and give every chance I get
Oh I wanna do life big
I wanna do life big

I wanna do life big
I wanna love like You

I wanna give like You
Oh, I wanna do life big
I wanna serve like You
Lay down my life like You
I wanna do life big...
I wanna do...
I wanna do...
I wanna do life big.
I wanna do...
I wanna do...
I wanna do life big.
