I'm not your toy
I'm not your toy
I'm Not Your Toy - La Roux
I'm not your toy
I'm not your toy
I'm not your toy
Love love is like a stubborn youth
That you'd rather just deny
I'm walking on a broken roof
But i'm looking at the sky
It's all false love and affection
You don't want me you just like the attention
Yes it's all false love and affection
You don't like me you just want the attention
I'm not your toy
I'm not your toy
Love love hides in a smoky night
I can never find the truth
Boy your touches leave me mystified
I wish i could believe in you
It's all false love and affection
You don't want me you just like the attention
Yes it's all false love and affection
You don't like me you just want the attention
I'm not your toy
I'm not your toy
