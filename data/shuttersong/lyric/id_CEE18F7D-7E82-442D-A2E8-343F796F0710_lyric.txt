I'm mixed up so terribly
Your body language talking over me
And it might not be logical
But baby my mind just won't let you leave

And I crave
Your taste under my tongue everyday (all day)
Keep the forbidden fruit coming my way
I wanna feel your sugar in my veins
Baby just wanna feel

Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
You sip what the devil's drinking
Hot as hell and I'm thinking
Baby, baby, baby
Can you take away my pain?
Baby, baby, baby
Can you take away my pain?

Maybe I don't wanna think about it
All I wanna be is under your control
Inside of your spell, locked in your eyes
Under your influence, don't let me go

And I crave
Your taste under my tongue everyday (all day)
I keep the forbidden fruit coming my way
I wanna feel your sugar in my veins
Baby just wanna feel

Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
You sip what the devil's drinking
Hot as hell and I'm thinking
Baby, baby, baby
Can you take away my pain?
Baby, baby, baby
Can you take away my pain?

Laying in your ecstasy I'm floating away
Laying in your ecstasy I'm floating away

Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
You sip what the devil's drinking
Hot as hell and i'm thinking
Baby, baby, baby
Can you take away my pain?
Baby, baby, baby
Can you take away my pain?
Laying in your ecstas I'm floating away
Laying in your ecstasy I'm floating away
(Laying in your ecstasy I'm floating away)
(Laying in your ecstasy I'm floating away)
