We built our home out on the slopes
Pompeii beneath, she lay above
How she haunted our home
How she haunted our home

You were a god in my eyes
Above the clouds, above the skies
You were a god in my eyes
You were a god

You took me walking through the town
Showed me the statues underground
Said just don't they look in peace
Sometimes I wish that was me

I was the son you always had
Tugging at your coat when you were sad
I was the son you always had
I was the son you always had

Don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to

Just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to

You said stay in the car and wait
There's just some things I have to say
Don't you know I miss her, too
I miss her just as much as you

So my father and my son
As you end what she's begun
You'll lie patient by her side
With roses red come lilies white

I was too young to understand
The flowers slipping from your hands
I was too young to understand
I was too young to understand

I was too young to understand
The flowers sleeping in her hands
I was too young to understand
I was too young to understand

Don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to

Please, just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to

And just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to

Please, just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to
