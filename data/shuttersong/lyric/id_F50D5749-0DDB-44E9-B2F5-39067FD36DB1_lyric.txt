Don't look around cause love is blind
And darling right now I can't see you
I'm feeling proud so without a doubt

I can feel you

Cause we are who we are when no one's watching
And right from the start, you know I got you
Yeah you know I got you

I won't mind
Even though I know you'll never be mine
I won't mind
Even though I know you'll never be mine

We messed around until we found the one thing
we said we could never ever live without
I'm not allowed to talk about it
But I gotta tell you

Cause we are who we are when no one's watching
And right from the start, you know I got you
Yeah you know I got you

I won't mind
Even though I know you'll never be mine
I won't mind
Even though I know you'll never be mine
