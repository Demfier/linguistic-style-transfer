I can get you to that vulnerable state I swear you're so submissive
The one to make you feel that way, you know that I was missin'
Know you can't keep going through the day waitin' on me to hit ya
Just be patient with me, girl those places I could take you
I could take you (uhh)
I could take you

I could take yoou

I could take you
Here you go hit me with the same line
With the same line
Don't you know I'm nothing like your last guy
Like your last guy (I'm better)
Gotta mile beat by a land slight, girl you can't lie (yeah you know it)
Do it make you feel right? (know)
Don't you know you was all mine? (let them know)
See the places I might take you
Your life I could change it
I might make you famous
Just say the word
I can arrange it
You used to be good not now misbehaving
Look at you, got a crib in the hills we coun rendezvous
And we can do whathever whenever you want to

So what you gonna do? What you gonna do?
I can take you
I can get you to that vulnerable state I swear you're so submissive
The one to make you feel that way, you know that I was missin'
Know you can't keep going through the day waitin' on me to hit ya
Just be patient with me, girl those places I could take you
I could take yoou (uhh)
I could take you

I could take yoou
I could take you
Uh
I can take you to those places that you dream about
Girl there ain't no fallen once we're on this cloud
Just gimme your attention I could show you how
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Only good vibrations
We're moving slow motion don't arrest the situation
Put you on lyrics that's a my high [?]
Only heading up baby ain't no limitation
And you feel it I know
I can hold you down no matter how high you go
That you go
That you go
That you go
I could take you
That you go
That you go
Well, I could take yoou
I could take you

I could take yoou

I could take you
I could take you, I could take you
Ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
Ain't no ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
Ain't no ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
Ain't no ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
(ain't no) falling down
