(We're so glad you joined us)
We've been waiting for Your presence to arrive all day
(We're humbled You're here)
We kneel up at Your feet and we refuse to leave the same
(The truth is)
Yokes don't break on their own
Our hands are not that strong
And giving up feels wrong
When you've been waiting for so long
(Come on!)
For destiny and victory to finally collide
(Yes!)
There's no sound more sweeter than when God says "It's time"

(I get prideful)
Every time I step out independent, God I fail
(You still take me back)
So here we are broken, so glad that You destroyed the veil
(Because of the cross)
Condemnation is all gone
Humbled before Your Throne
(Thank You)
You say this is where I belong
That I've been patient for so long
(For destiny)
For destiny and victory to finally collide
There's no sound more sweeter than when God says "It's time"
(So tell)
So tell all the voices I'm doing just fine
(Tell 'em I'm good)
For this day is the day when God says "It's time"

Time for power and not just things
Time for healing the inner me
Time to be truly free to walk in faith not in what I see
No more time for childish things to warm you up and feel complete
What shall we say about these things
Soon in time the world will see
Destiny and victory finally collide
There's no sound more sweeter than when God says "It's time"
So tell all the voices "I'm doing just fine"
For this day is the day when God says "It's time"

(Time for heartache to leave my life)
For this day is the day when God says "It's time"
(Rumors, sickness, defeat, goodbye)
Lift your voices, God says "It's time"
(Jobless, homeless, you don't know the... you don't know the...
You don't know the trouble)
But this day is the day when God says "It's time"
(You're stronger, closer, you didn't give up the fight)
Lift your voices, God says "It's time"
(All the praying, all you've been believing,
Don't give up the fight no no)
This day is the day when God says "It's time"
(All things are working together for your good
So I know it's gon' be alright)
Lift your voices
God says "IT'S TIME!"
