A million thoughts in my head
Should I let my heart keep listenin'?
Cause up till now I've walked the line
Nothing lost but something missing

I can't, decide, what's wrong, what's right
Which way should I go?
If only I knew what my heart was telling me
Don't know what I'm feeling

Is this just a dream?
Uh oh, Yeah,
If only I could read the signs in front of me
I could find the way to who I'm meant to be uh oh

If only
yeah!
Am I crazy? Maybe we could happen... yeah
Will you still be with me when the magic's all run out?

If only I knew what my heart was telling me
Don't know what I'm feeling
Is this just a dream? Uh oh
If only, yeah
If only, yeah
If only, yeah
If only,
If only.
