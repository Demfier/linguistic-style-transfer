Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my

Hopes and my dreams
But I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from

She's waiting for me
So I'll make my way
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats

For my home and my English rose
I told my dad
On the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the crazy these places I've seen
But I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother

He understands me
I'll spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats

For my home and my English rose
I met a man
In the bar down in Memphis

he told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me \
