Don't tell me that you love me
I won't tell you that I love you
We're too high to see the runway

Too far to know the right way

The truth is
I'm freaking out about this whole
Man I'm supposed to be
I'm nervous now cause she can't know
I'm desperately in need
Cause up here's hard to reach
Fly down, fly down

We were staring down the valley
When she put her arm 'round me
She said the reason you've been hurt is
So you look beyond the surface

The truth is
I'm freaking out about this whole
Man I'm supposed to be
I'm nervous now cause she can't know
I'm desperately in need
Cause up here's hard to reach
Fly down, fly down
Fly down

Don't tell me that you love me
I won't tell you that I love you
