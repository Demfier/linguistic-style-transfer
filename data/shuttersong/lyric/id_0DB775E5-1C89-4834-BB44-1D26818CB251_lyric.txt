Kiss me hard before you go,
Summertime Sadness.
I just wanted you to know,
That baby, you're the best.

I got my red dress on tonight,
Dancing in the dark in the pale moon light.
Done my hair up real big,
beauty queen style.

High heels off,
I'm feeling alive.
Oh, my god
I feel it in the air,

telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare.
Honey, I'm on fire
I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore. (1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go,
Summertime Sadness.
I just wanted you to know,
That baby, you're the best.
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness

Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh
I'm feeling ill at trick tonight,

Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavinly side,
I know if I go,
I'll die happy tonight.

Oh, my god
I feel it in the air,
telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare.
Honey, I'm on fire
I feel it everywhere

Nothing scares me anymore. (1, 2, 3, 4)
Kiss me hard before you go,
Summertime Sadness.
I just wanted you to know,

That baby, you're the best.
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh
I think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies
Late is better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, (drive, driiiiive)
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
