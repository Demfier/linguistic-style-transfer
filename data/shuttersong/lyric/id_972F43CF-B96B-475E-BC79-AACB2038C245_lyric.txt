I would have given you all of my heart
But theres someone whos torn it apart
And shes taking almost all that Ive got
But if you want, Ill try to love again
Baby Ill try to love again but I know

The First Cut Is The Deepest, baby I know
The First Cut Is The Deepest
cause when it comes to being lucky shes cursed
When it comes to lovin me shes worse
But when it comes to being loved shes first
Thats how I know
The First Cut Is The Deepest, baby I know
The First Cut Is The Deepest

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that Ive cried
Cause Im sure gonna give you a try
And if you want, Ill try to love again
But baby, Ill try to love again, but I know

The First Cut Is The Deepest, baby I know
The First Cut Is The Deepest
cause when it comes to being lucky shes cursed
When it comes to lovin me shes worse
But when it comes to being loved shes first
Thats how I know
The First Cut Is The Deepest, baby I know
The First Cut Is The Deepest (2)

cause when it comes to being lucky shes cursed

But when it comes to being loved shes first
Thats how I know
