you gotta get up
you gotta get up and make a move
cuz the world will never see you until you do
no they don't really care what you're going through
so you've gotta show 'em baby
you gotta show 'em the real you
you gotta give 'em what you got
no don't let them say what you're not
cuz you are strong
you are wise
you are worth beyond a thousand reasons why
and you can't be perfect baby
cuz nobody's perfect darling
but no no no there's nobody in the world
like you
what do you do when you can't let go
what do you say when you just don't know how you feel
and you know nobody knows how you feel
cuz everybody's got their own damn problems
so everybody's tryna find their way
and day by day is a struggle in this world
you know you have to hustle
just know
that youre not alone
you dont always have to be strong all by yourself
i said it's ok to ask for help
now listen
people will find you
but they don't define you
and you will find people
who help redesign you
people will find you
but they don't define you
and you will find people
who help redesign you
you are a work of art
bet you didn't think you'd come this far
now here you are
baby you are strong
you are wise
you are worth beyond a thousand reasons why
and you can't be perfect baby
cuz nobody's perfect darling
no no no there's nobody in the world
like you
(you know you're worth it)
