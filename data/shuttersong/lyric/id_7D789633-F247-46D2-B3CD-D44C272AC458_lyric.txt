Yo, this one right here is for all the drop-out-of-schoolers.
The future cougars. The Mary Jane abusers.
The ones that choose to be losers, for all the Misfit Kids and total outcasts MKTO.
This one's for you, role models.

We are the ones, the ones you left behind.
Don't tell us how, tell us how to live our lives.
Ten million strong we're breaking all the rules.
Thank you for nothing, 'cause there's nothing left to lose.

Thank you for feeding us years of lies.
Thank you for the wars you left us to fight.
Thank you for the world you ruined overnight.
But we'll be fine, yeah we'll be fine.

Thank you for the world you broke,
Like yolk and it ain't no joke.
So cold and there ain't no coat,
Just me, my friends, my folks
And we gonna do what we like.
So raise that bird up high
And when they ask you why.
Just stand there laugh and smile.

We are the ones, the ones you left behind.
Don't tell us how, tell us how to live our lives.
Ten million strong we're breaking all the rules.
Thank you for nothing, 'cause there's nothing left to lose.

Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
(Thank you)

Thank you for the times you said, \
