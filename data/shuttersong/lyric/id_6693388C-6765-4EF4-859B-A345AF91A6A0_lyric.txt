Start it up,
Turn it on
We can ride this storm
A grip of hope in our hands
For the coming dawn
Up to our necks in complexities
Causing us to pause
As we collect our thoughts

So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits

Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition Comatose,
Half-hearted,
Room temperature's fine,
Sleep walking, no dream is even filling our minds.
Earth shaking,
We be quaking like a wake up bomb
This ain't no trouble overseas,
No Vietnam

So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits

(Come on, take it up a notch, come on, turn it up a notch!)

Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition You're sleep walking,
I'm sleep walking
(Turn on)
You're sleep walking,
I'm still talking

Come spark the parts in me that all but died
You're sleep walking,
I'm sleep walking
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
You're sleep walking,
I'm still talking

Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die
Hold up the flag 'cause it's RIDE OR DIE

Turn on the ignition, turn on Turn on, turn on
Come on, come on Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition Turn on the ignition,
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Turn on the ignition,
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
Turn on,
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Turn on,
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
