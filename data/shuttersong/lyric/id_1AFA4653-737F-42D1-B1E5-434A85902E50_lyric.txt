Sitting all alone
Waiting by the phone
Wishing she would call

So I can make her see this other side of me & how hard I can fall
But she don't know me
She don't see me
And all the things that I can be
Where to begin, I just can't win until the day she finally sees
What she means to me

I gotta get the girl
Get her in my world
I'd do anything for her
I just gotta get the girl

Now all bets are off
Yeah it's worth the cost
Just to know in time
Cuz there'll come a day, when she'll look my way & I will make her mine

But she don't know me
She don't see me
And all the things that I can be
Where to begin, I just can't win until the day she finally sees
She's the one for me

I gotta get the girl
Get her in my world
I'd do anything for her
I just gotta get the girl

I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
To brighten up your day in every single way
Just gotta get you girl
Gotta get you girl
