I had a roof over head
Had shoes on my feet
Yeah sure I was fed
But no one was there when I was in need, yeah

So who am I now?
Who do you want me to be?
I can forgive you but I won't relive you
I ain't the same scared kid I used to be

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream, I ain't gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie

I want to be loved
I want to be loved

I found a picture
Our so called family tree, yeah
I broke all the branches, looking for answers
Don't you know that it ain't how it's supposed to be

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream, I ain't gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie

I wanna give, I'm ready to try
I'm willing to lay it on the line
I want to be loved
I want to be

I ain't gonna cry, I don't want to scream
But I got so much left unsaid inside of me

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream, I ain't gonna die
Thinking my life was just a lie
I wanna give, I'm ready to try
I'm willing to lay it on the line
I want to be loved
Want to be loved
I just want to be loved
I want to be loved
I want to be loved
I want to be loved
