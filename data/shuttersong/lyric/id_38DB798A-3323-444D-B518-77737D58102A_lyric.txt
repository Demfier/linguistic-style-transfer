(Logic) I'm tryna write my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs help me write this song, now

See? I was born into a world of food stamps and welfare
No dollar for the ice cream man and nappy hair
Raised by a single mom, but in the back of my mind

I thought I gotta have my pops, no cereal
Never had a lot, but now I got plenty material
No longer, do I wish for money
Cause being broke made me stronger, harder, faster, better

So now I alphabetically murder every letter, uh
Feel the conviction in my words like a jail sentence
Murderin' a first through a verse won't be no repentance
Mama, I'm sorry that I left at seventeen

But I had to chase my dream and get this motherfuckin' cream
Only people that I got is the people that's on my team
Cause when I roll up on the scene I see everyone start to scheme
Talk about they connections, talk about who they know

Then they beggin' me for a feature but I'm like hold up yo
If you know who you know why the fuck you ain't blow
Matter fact you ain't fuck with me this time last year though
I was kicking rhymes but you ain't paid no mind or the soul

And you on my dick riding like the baddest of hoes
You think its easy but it's not
See this talent that I got
Determination keep it fresh if I don't shine in this gold mine

Cause it don't happen overnight
One hit wonders don't keep the spot

And I plan to hold the torch until I pass it and get shot, what

See? This is dedication, running up on radio stations

They with the glind enter my mind they was just hatin' haha
Testing my patience they got me pissed like probation
But I had the mind to keep going and the heart to keep racing
And as the world crumbled beneath my feet like a Haitian

I was inspired by them to persevere through dedication
Failure I'm never facing my lyrics is education
So if you got the tape crank that shit like Jason Statham

Yeah, this is my story word by word as I'm emerging just relax and let me open your mind like brain surgeon, uh
Fresh in the game they should sign me to the virgin
But me and solo know that I would only get to splurgin'
I see the road to success and now its time to merge in
Don't forget us when you gone what my homies urging, don't forget us when you gone, uhh I gotcha
You see these Seinfeld rappers talking a whole lot of nothing so allow me to curve your enthusiasm or something
This is kinda like M.J before his prime when he dunking cause I ain't 23 yet but when I'm there it'll be something

Growing up there was baby momma drama everyday and every way
But now my kids I ain't got none to this day
Cause a rubber around my Jimmy when I consider foreplay
Hey, back in the day West Deer Park where we stay
I was running around while momma was drinking everyday
But it's okay I wouldn't have it any other way
Cause it developed me into the young man that you see today
Through dedication, yeah, yeah
Never follow traditions you see I had a different vision
I would skip school and writin' compositions 'bout my home conditions
You know the usual no money and family division
In specific I remember this time in my kitchen
With my sister's man back before he went to prison and got into religion
He showed me how to cook crack at 12 and I ain't kiddin'
After releasing him with ba-- he no longer living
And I'm pretty sure his last breath was lord forgive him
Now my nephew ain't got a father there to keep him safe
All I can hope is he a good boy for his mommas sake
Cause she never did recover from his father's fate
And if he grew into a man that made the same mistake
Well to be honest I don't know how much more she could take
So to every baby momma that could truly relate it is you unto this song that I should dedicate, yeah
