Today i meet a woman
i dont think you know
she show a smile, no bodys ever shown
she took off her clothes
and a jacket of fold
she told about somewhere, behind the rose
is looking out the bed, she said seem somebody is close
is knowing that tomorrow your not gonna wake up alone
so feel it on the legs upon my bones
thats the beauty behind the rose

is walking down the street to your old home
is the feeling of your feet on the familiar stone
is all those little things she does
that let you know
thats the beauty behind the rose
and once you find it, I know you wont gonna go
you stay up so late, you fall asleep in your clothes
you can take back a song, once itÂ´s been wrote
but thats the beauty behind the rose.
