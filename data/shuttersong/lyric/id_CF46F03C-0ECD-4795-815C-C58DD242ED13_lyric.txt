Hey brother, there's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Ohhh, when the sky comes falling down, for you

There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey brother, do you still believe in one another
Hey sister, do you still believe in love I wonder
Ohhh, when the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Oh oh oh, what if I'm far from home
Oh brother I will hear you call
What if I lose you all
Oh sister I will help you out

Ohhh, when the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Do you think about me when you're all alone?
The things we used to do, we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Do you think about me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
