Please Don't Stop The Music (Workout Remix   123 BPM) - The Workout Heroes
It's getting late
I'm making my way over to
My favorite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody
When you looked my way
Possible candidate  yeah
Who would knew
That you'd be up in here looking like you do
You making staying over here impossible
Baby  Ima say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go  don't
Do you know what just started 
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin on the dance floor acting naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand  chest to chest  and now we're face
To face
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music  DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rocking to it
Please don't stop the  please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music  DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rocking to it
Please don't stop the  please don't stop the music
Baby are you ready cause it's gettin close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode 
What goes on between us no-one has to know
This is a private show(oh)
Do you know what just started 
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin on the dance floor  acting naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand  chest to chest  and now we're face
To face
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music  DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rocking to it
Please don't stop the  please don't stop the  music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music  DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rocking to it
Please don't stop the  please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music  DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rocking to it
Please don't stop the  please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music  DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rocking to it
Please don't stop the  please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the music
