I know your inside, you're feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow
But if I fall for you
I'll never recover

If I fall for you
I'll never be the same
I really want love somebody
I really want dance the night away

I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way
You take me all the way
I really want touch somebody

I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way
You take me all the way

You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today don't leave me tomorrow
Yeah
But if I fall for you

I'll never recover
If I fall for you
I'll never be the same
I really want love somebody
I really want dance the night away

I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way
You take me all the way
I really want touch somebody

I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way
You take me all the way
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know where to start
I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we never gone
Ever stop
I don't what to do
I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay
You should stay
Stay with me tonight
Yeah
I really want love somebody
I really want dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way
You take me all the way
I really want touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way
You take me all the way
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You take me all the way
You take me all the way
