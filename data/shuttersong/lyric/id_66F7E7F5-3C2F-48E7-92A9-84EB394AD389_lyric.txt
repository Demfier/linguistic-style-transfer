I guess for now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here

Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
with this boy who's hollerin' and I can hardly hear
over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you

So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, \
