Oh oh oh oh oh
If I have a moment
I'd capture that moment
You would be right here next to me
If I have the secret
The secret to your love
I would plant your treasure with me
For my heart
Lock it all up
Throw away the key
I would never give it up
Cause I was just a fool
A fool for you
When I loved you so childishly

And I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
Said, I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
Said, I want it all

You never miss a good thing til it's gone

I want it all, now I want it all back
If there is a green light
And its bout to turn yellow
Pedal to the floor cause I know your heart is turning red
If I had the minutes, I would turn them into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead
I was just a fool
A fool for you

That didn't know what I had until I lost you
Every single moment that you're not here

It's evident to me that everything just seems all clear
And I want it all back
I gotta have it all
I want it all
I want it all
Girl, I want it all back

I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all

Girl, I want it all
You never miss a good thing til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all back
Now everything isn't everything
If everything, everything isn't with you
And I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
Said, I want it all
You never miss a good thing til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
