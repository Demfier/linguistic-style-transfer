Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night, calling out father oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side, and if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together, raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh, should my people fall, then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will

Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side

Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze

And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire, inside the mountains
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) (fire)
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)
And I see fire (uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
