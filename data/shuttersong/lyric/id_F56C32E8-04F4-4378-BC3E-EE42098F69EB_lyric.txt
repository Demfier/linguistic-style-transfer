Put your flags up in the sky (put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from
(show them where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)

When the moment gets tough
You've got keep going
One love, one life, one world
One fight, whole world, one night, one place
Brazil, everybody put your flags
in the sky and do what you feel

It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play

Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo de nosotros
Invitamos a todo el mundo a jugar con nosotros

One night watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes
Full heart's gonna work so hard
Shoot, fall, the stars
Fists raised up towards the sky
Tonight watch the world unite, world unite, world unite
For the fight, fight, fight, one night
Watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes

Show the world we are one (one love, life)

иж meu, иж seu
Hoje иж tudo nosso
Quando chega o mundo inteiro pra jogar иж pra mostrar que eu posso
Torcer, chorar, sorrir, gritar
N?o importar o resultado, vamos extravasar
