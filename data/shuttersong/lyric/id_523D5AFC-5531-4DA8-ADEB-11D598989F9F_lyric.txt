Sunny days (sunny days)
I know are quite rare but I don't care cause I'm still happy
Oh so happy with the world today
What about a pretty girl?
Well, maybe yes but I'm okay
I've had enough heart break through the day
No thrills just beans and toast today

Hey, Hey
Well, no more sunny days
Not even a glimmer of the suns rays
It's just me and my mates sky sports,
now you're gone I'm watching too much sky sports
What I'm doing? Where I'm goin'? I dunno today
One plate at the table, there use to be two
Now you're gone, I'm even watching count down
I bet you're with your friends, all around town
You're the only thing that I think about most
Looks like it's just me, my beans and toast.

Well, maybe yes but I'm okay
I've had enough heart break through the day
No thrills just beans and toast tonight

I feel low
I've already shedded a tear
Surrounded by pizza boxes and flat beer
I've got a head ache now, one too many
I'm confused I thought things were going well
But it turns out that wasn't the case
Tell me were over bad news down the phone
I just wanted to see your face for the last time
Maybe I can change your thoughts from your last line
It's you that I think about most
Looks like it's just me my beans and toast

I've had enough heart break through the day
No thrills just beans and toast tonight

I'm alone and that's okay
And there's nothing more to say
I'll just get on with my life
Now you're gone
Now you're gone.
