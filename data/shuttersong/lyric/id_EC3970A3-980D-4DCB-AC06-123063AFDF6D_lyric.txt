Figure Me Out (Live) - The Summer Set
I'm a bit too pop for the punk kids
But I'm too punk for the pop kids
I don't know just where I fit in
Cause when I open my mouth I know nobody's listening
To the words of a prophet
Who still can't turn a profit
Cuz I don't fit in with the in crowd
But I'm too Hollywood to go back to my hometown
Cause they think that I'm famous
When I know I'm a fraud
Who got too fucked up on the finer things
To remember who he forgot
But I believe there's more to life than all my problems
Maybe there's still hope for me to start again
I'll get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think it's time for me to figure me out
Let's get back to the basics
And take it back to the basement
Where I heard born to run for the first time
And I stared at my dad in amazement
He said son don't stop chasing great and
Keep pounding the pavement
So I'd much rather die trying to make something sacred
Then live as another Youtube sensation
Cause I hate that they're famous
For being something they're not
While I'm too hung up on the things I don't have
To appreciate what I've got
But I believe there's more to life than all my problems
Maybe there's still hope for me to start again
I'll get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think it's time for me to figure me out
Time for me to figure me out
Time for me to figure me out
So if you hear this song turn it up real loud
Cuz it's time for me to figure me out
All right if you hear this song turn it up real loud
Cuz it's time for me to figure me out
I believe there's more to life than all my problems
I just wanna fall in love before I'm dead
So I can make my parents proud
I hope my feet don't fail me now
I think it's time for me to figure me out
