Best believe you couldn't cure me if you tried
Sweet relief cause I like doing what I like
Constantly I suffer from my sorry lives
It's killing me cause I know you love me right
You know what to say
You know what do
You know how to play
You know, you know
Ooooh so wonderful
Kisses tasting like chronic
Give me some cause I want it
Like all the time
And ooooh, it hits me good
Yeah, it's keeping me breathing
Chasing after the feeling
Like all the time
Your chronic, I got it
On my mind
Your chronic, I want it
Like all the time
What's the deal? You only treat me like a queen
It's so serial, I've always been a little mean but
I can feel my heart bursting at the seams
It's my greatest fear, loving anyone, anything
You know what to say
You know what do
You know how to play
You know, you know
Ooooh so wonderful
Kisses tasting like chronic
Give me some cause I want it
Like all the time
And ooooh, it hits me good
Yeah, it's keeping me breathing
Chasing after the feeling
Like all the time
Your chronic, I got it
On my mind
Your chronic, I want it
Like all the time
Your kisses taste like chronic
It's got me low key heart sick
I'm trying to be modest
But you know... I want it
Ooooh so wonderful
Kisses tasting like chronic
Give me some cause I want it
Like all the time
And ooooh, it hits me good
Yeah, it's keeping me breathing
Chasing after the feeling
Like all the time
Your chronic, I got it
On my mind
Your chronic, I want it
Like all the time
Your chronic, I got it
On my mind
Your chronic, I want it
Like all the time
