Never Forget You - Zara Larsson/MNEK \n Written by£ºZara Larsson/Uzoechi Emenike/Arron Davey \n I used to be so happy but without you here I feel so low\n I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go\n Cause once upon a time you were my everything\n It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing\n It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know\n I will never forget you\n You will always be by my side\n From the day that I met you\n I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die\n And I will never want much more\n And in my heart I will always be sure\n I will never forget you\n And you will always be by my side\n 'Til the day I die\n Til the day I die\n Til the day I die\n Til the day I die\n Funny how we both end up here but everything seems so right\n I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight\n Cause once upon a time you were my everything\n It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing\n Just what do you think could ever take you off my mind\n I will never forget you\n You will always be by my side\n From the day that I met you\n I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die\n And I will never want much more\n And in my heart I will always be sure\n I will never forget you\n And you will always be by my side\n 'Til the day I die\n Feeling it loving it everything that we do\n And all along I knew I had something special with you\n But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through\n But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you\n Feeling it loving it everything that we do\n And all along I knew I had something special with you\n But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through\n I can't hide my connection with you\n I will never forget you\n You will always be by my side\n From the day that I met you\n I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die\n And I will never want much more\n And in my heart I will always be sure\n I will never forget you\n And you will always be by my side\n 'Til the day I die\n Til the day I die 'til the day I die 'til the day I die\n Til the day I die 'til the day I die 'til the day I die\n And you will always be by my side\n I will never forget you\n I will never never never never never never never never\n I will never forget you\n Til the day I die
