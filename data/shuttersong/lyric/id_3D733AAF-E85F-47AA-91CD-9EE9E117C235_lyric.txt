You've read the books, you've watched the shows
what's the best way, no one knows, yeah
meditate, yeah, hypnotized
anything to take it from your mind
but it won't go
you're doing all these things out of desperation
you're going through six degrees of separation

You hit the drink, you take a toke
watch the past go up in smoke
you fake a smile, you lie and say
you're better now than ever and your life's ok
well it's not ...no
you're doing all these things out of desperation
you're going through six degrees of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you've fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have messed up a little

No, no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself
No, no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself

You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too
anyone who will throw an arm around you
tarot cards, gems and stones
believing all that shit's gonna heal your soul
well it's not, no
you're only doing things out of desperation
you're going through six degrees of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, Is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you've fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little

Oh no there's no starting over
without finding closure
you take them back no hesitation
that's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation
oh no there's no starting over
without finding closure
you take them back no hesitation
that's how you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation
