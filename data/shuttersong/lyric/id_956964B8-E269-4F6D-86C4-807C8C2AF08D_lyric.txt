Come On Eileen
Come On Eileen

Poor, old Johnnie Ray
sounded sad upon the radio
he moved a million hearts in mono
our mothers used to sing along
who'd blame them?

You've grown, (your grown up)
So grown(so grown up)
now I must say more than ever
(Come on Eileen) Toora Loora Toora Loo-Rye Aye
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen, oh I swear (well he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
you in that dress, oh my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah, come on Eileen

(Come on Eileen)

These people round here
wear beaten down eyes
Sunk in smoke dried faces
Resigned to what their fate is
But not us, (no never) no not us (no never)
We are far too young and clever

(Remember)
Toora Loora Toora Loo-Rye Aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever
Toora Loora Toora Loo-Rye Aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Come on Eileen, oh I swear (well he means)
Ah come on, let's take off everything (everything)
That pretty red dress, oh Eileen (tell him yes)
Ah, come on lets
ah, come on Eileen

Come on Eileen, oh I swear (well he means)
At this moment, you mean everything

Come on, Eileen Taloo-Rye-Aye
Come on, Eileen Taloo-Rye-Aye
Toora, Toora, Too-Loora
Oh, Eileen
I said come on, Eileen [Come on, Eileen Taloo-Rye-Aye]
Oh, come on, Eileen [Come on, Eileen Taloo-Rye-Aye]
[Toora, Toora Too-Loora]
We are far too young and clever
And things won't ever change

And I say
Toora Loora Toora Loo-Rye Aye
Come on, Eileen oh
I swear that you mean
at this moment you mean everything to me
oh Eileen
oh Eileen
You mean everything
