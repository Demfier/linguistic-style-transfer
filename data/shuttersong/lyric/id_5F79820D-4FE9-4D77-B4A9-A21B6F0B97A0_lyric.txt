I once was dead in sin alone and hopeless
A child of wrath I walked condemned in darkness
But Your mercy brought new life and in Your love and kindness
Raised me up with Christ and made me righteous

You have bought me back with the riches of
Your amazing grace and relentless love
I'm made alive forever with You, life forever
By Your grace I'm saved, by Your grace I'm saved

You have bought me back with the riches of
Your amazing grace and relentless love
I'm made alive forever with You, life forever
By Your grace I'm saved, by Your grace I'm saved

Lord, You are the light that broke the darkness
You satisfy my soul when I am heartless
If ever I forget my true identity
Show me who I am and help me to believe

You have bought me back with the riches of
Your amazing grace and relentless love
I'm made alive forever with You, life forever
By Your grace I'm saved, by Your grace I'm saved

My sin has been erased, I'll never be the same
My sin has been erased, I'll never be the same

You have bought me back with the riches of
Your amazing grace and relentless love
I'm made alive forever with You, life forever
By Your grace I'm saved, by Your grace I'm saved

You have bought me back with the riches of
Your amazing grace and relentless love
I'm made alive forever with You, life forever
By Your grace I'm saved, by Your grace I'm saved
