Missed calls and ignored texts and late night I'm staying up stressing.
Girl I got you on my mind, I swear this happens every time.
Yeah, but what about our last fight? Yeah, I know it happened last night.
You can put that in the past right? I'm just trying to live the fast life.

Uh, and what's love without trust girl? And what's love without lust girl?
I've been thinking bout us girl. I've been thinking bout.

So what do we do now? Everything we built, we broke it.
It's all shattered and broken. I can't get you out of my head.
It's all falling down, time that we get going.
Things you never told me, I thought you were the one.

Yeah, I thought you were the one but I guess things change.
No it's nothing with the fame girl I swear it's all the same.
There's a difference, an interest, I feel it when we're kissing.
One day you're here and the next day you're missing.

Uh, can we be consistent? Girl, are you even listening?
Yeah, got me feeling so distant. I'll be gone in an instant.

So what do we do now? Everything we built, we broke it.
It's all shattered and broken. I can't get you out of my head.
It's all falling down, time that we get going.
Things you never told me, I thought you were the one.

So what do we do now?

Yeah, really I wanna know.
Looking at you in the eyes even though mine are kind of low.
And it's easy to see that something is hurting you so bad.
I know that the rhythm and flow that I'm putting on this slow track are gonna make you so sad.
At least I can say for the time I was satisfied.
Answering machine, hearing your name next to mine.
