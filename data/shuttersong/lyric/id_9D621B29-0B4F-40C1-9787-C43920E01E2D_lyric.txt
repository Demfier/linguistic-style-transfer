Mmhm, mmhm

Yo, ayo

I was on the plane with the Wayne

You could call me Whitley, I go to Hill, meng

Listen, I'm the baddest in the school

The baddest in the game

Excuse me, honey, but nobody's in my lane

When you was in New York, you was fuckin' the Yankee

I was fuckin' with base, I was pitchin' to Frankie

These bitches so cranky

Give 'em a hanky

But mommy, I'm cold give me me my blanky

Nicki Speaking

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Ok. Ok. Whoa! Whoa, Holiday! Wait! Hold on! Hold on, Holiday!

You can't give it to 'em dry like that.

You gotta get that shit wet first, nigga.

Like c'mon now!

You gotta prep them for shit like that.

They can't just get that shit right off the top.

Like you gotta bring that shit back!

Bring that shit the fuck back!

Flyer than a kite

I get higher than Rapunzel

Step ya cookies up 'fore they crumble

Don't be actin' like the Cardinals and go fumble

'Cause I'm a stealer

Fresh up out the dealer

All the dopeboys gon' feel her

Flow so sick I need a healer

Fuck is my mac concealer

I be out in Queens in the back of 4 whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-wheelers

I'm a big bill

That's why I get more head than a pigtail

Put some ranch, I'm getting the munchies

I think I'll have a rap bitch for my entr¨¦e

'Cause they be thinkin' they can spit-spit shine my shoes

You know I keep a bad bitch

Let me sign ya boobs

I'm the only thing hoppin' like a kangaroo

I mean the only thing poppin' like a can of brew

Listen, you should buy a 16 'cause I ride it good

The 808, woof-woof, cause I ride it good

And bitches can't find a man 'cause I ride it good

I'm the wolf!

Where is little reda-riding hood?!

Chorus

And if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market,

Give that bitch a quarter and a car

Tell her, "Park it!"

I don't fuck with pigs like asalamalekam

I put 'em in the field and let Oscar Mayer bake 'em!
