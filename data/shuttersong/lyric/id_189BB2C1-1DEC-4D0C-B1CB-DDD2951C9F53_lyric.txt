The Heart Wants What It Wants - Selena Gomez\n You got me sipping on something\n I can't compare to nothing\n I bet for known I'm hoping\n That after this fever I'll survive\n I know I'm acting a bit crazy\n Strung out  a little bit hazy\n Hand over heart  I'm praying\n That I'm gonna make it out alive\n The bed's getting cold\n And you're not here\n The future that we hold is so unclear\n But I'm not alive until you call\n And I'll bet the odds against it all\n Save your advice 'cause I won't hear\n You might me right but I don't care\n There's a million reasons\n Why I should give you up\n But the heart wants what it wants\n But the heart wants what it wants\n You got me scattered in pieces\n Shining like stars and screaming\n Lightening me up like Venus\n But then you disappear\n And make me wait\n And every second's like torture\n Hell over trip  no more so\n Finding a way to let go\n Baby baby no I can't escape\n The bed's getting cold\n And you're not here\n The future that we hold is so unclear\n But I'm not alive until you call\n And I'll bet the odds against it all\n Save your advice 'cause I won't hear\n You might me right but I don't care\n There's a million reasons\n Why I should give you up\n But the heart wants what it wants\n But the heart wants what it wants\n But the heart wants what it wants\n But the heart wants what it wants\n This is a modern fairy-tale\n No happy endings\n No winning ourselves\n But I can't imagine a life without\n Breathless moments\n Breaking me down\n Down down down\n The bed's getting cold\n And you're not here\n The future that we hold is so unclear\n But I'm not alive until you call\n And I'll bet the odds against it all\n Save your advice 'cause I won't hear\n You might me right but I don't care\n There's a million reasons\n Why I should give you up\n But the heart wants what it wants\n But the heart wants what it wants\n But the heart wants what it wants\n But the heart wants what it wants\n The heart wants what it wants baby\n What it wants baby\n What it wants baby\n What it wants baby
