With you I'm tired of trying
with her I found a silver lining
She smiles and storms all blow away,
but you're still cloudy with a chance of pain

At first, I wanted you to date me
I loved that you were kind of crazy
Turns out that you were really just insane
Six months, we've been out of high school
You're still acting like you're so cool
A prom queen and no one even knows your name, yeah

Let me tell you about moving on and on

I've got me a new girl
There's life in her blue eyes
She's nothing like you, girl
She's not messed up inside

With you I'm tired of trying
with her I found a silver lining
She smiles and storms all blow away,
but you're still cloudy with a chance of pain

Cloudy with a chance of pain
Cloudy with a chance of pain

I've heard that you've been working late nights
Looks like you didn't meet your rich guy
Called up, to tell me that you want me back
Fk that tell me that you're joking
Yeah right, what have you been smoking
Too late I'm never going to take you back

Let me tell you about moving on and on

I've got me a new girl
There's life in her blue eyes
She's nothing like you, girl
She's not messed up inside
With you I'm tired of trying
With her i found a silver lining
She smiles and storms all blow away,
But you're still cloudy with a chance of pain

Cloudy with a chance of pain
Cloudy with a chance of pain

I've got me a new girl
There's life in her blue eyes
She's nothing like you, girl
She's not messed up inside
With you I'm tired of trying
With her I found a silver lining
She smiles and storms all blow away,
But you're still cloudy with a chance of pain
Cloudy with a chance of pain
Cloudy with a chance of pain
