My house in Budapest
My, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo

You
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all

My acres of a land
That I've achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe

But for you
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd Leave it all

Ooh, for you
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

My many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words
I I'll up and run

To you
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all

Ooh, to you
Ooh
Ooh, I'd leave it all

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason

Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My friends and family

They don't understand
They fear they'll lose so much
If you take my hand

But, for you
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd lose it all

Ooh, for you
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd lose it all.
Give me one good reason

Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
