Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!

Your picture's perfect blue
Sunbathing on the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss is just like a drug under your influence

Take me over you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

No silver or no gold could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do, I'll fall right into you
Going under cast a spell just say the word
I feel your love.

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You're the sun, a glowing halo
And you can keep burning up with your love, uh

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
