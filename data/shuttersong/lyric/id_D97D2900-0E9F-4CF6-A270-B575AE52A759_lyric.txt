Uh uh, check it out, uh, Junior Mafia uh

I like this, yeah, uh, yeah, 94

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' moet, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the chronic by the tree
I love it when you call me big poppa

Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
You got a gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place, why?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby, uh
Straight up honey really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin' but they be actin'

Who they attractin' with that line, \
