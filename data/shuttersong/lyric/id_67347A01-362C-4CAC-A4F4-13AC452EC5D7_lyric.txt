I'm on it, get on it
the troops are on fire
You know I need it, much closer
I'm trading just a little more

Step on it, electronic
the troops are on fire
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
waiting for the final trip

Come on it, get on it
I'm carving through a letter bomb
I need it like potions

these drugs are just an hour away
Come on it, electronic
a polyphonic prostitute
the motors on fire

Messiah for the animals

Ah!
Oh, come on!

We got our backs to the wall
Ah!
Get on and watch out
Sayin: yer gonna kill us all

Ah!
I'm on it, get on it
The troops are on fire

You know I need it, much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it, electronic
The troops are on fire

I'm much deeper, a sleeper
Messiah for the animals

Ah!
Oh, come on!
Sayin: we got our backs to the wall
Get on and watch out
Ah!
Before you kill us all
Ah!
Oh, come on!
Sayin: we got our backs to the wall
Get on and watch out
Ah!
Before you kill us all
