These people carry names
some will claim
they've never felt their heart ache
whos to blame
for all relationships
sunken ships
deserted on an island
I like to walk on the wild side
you like to keep things tame
I know its hard
the moments we're away
but patience is surely the way
When I look into your eyes
I don't question a doubt in my mind
I'm in love
When you came into my life
you filled up my heart with a cup
cup of love
