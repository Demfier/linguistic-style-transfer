Uno dos tres
It's been a really really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me

She's a California dime but it's time for me to quit her
La la la, whatever
La la la, it doesn't matter

La la la, oh well
La la la
We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop-top of the world
Tonight, tonight and were dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign

I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket

And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis
La la la, whatever

La la la, it doesn't matter
La la la, oh well
La la la
We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop-top of the world

Tonight, tonight and were dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

You got me singing like
Wo-o-oh, come on, o-o-oh, it doesn't matter
Wo-o-oh, everybody now, o-o-oh
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumping

Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance, if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out It's you and me and were running this town

And it's me and you and were shaking the ground
And ain't nobody gonna tell us to go cause this is our show
Everybody

Wo-o-oh, come on, o-o-oh, all you animals
Wo-o-oh, let me hear you now, o-o-oh
Tonight, tonight, there's a party on the rooftop-top of the world

Tonight, tonight and were dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it

It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
Yeah, it's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
Just singing like
