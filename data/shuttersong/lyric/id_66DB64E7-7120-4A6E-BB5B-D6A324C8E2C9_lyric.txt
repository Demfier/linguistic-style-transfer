You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
Because everything that don't make sense about me
Make sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You got to know you want it too
Because I want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty is deeper than the make up
And I want to show you what I see tonight
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I want to make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
I want to make you feel wanted
