You get used to
Dancing all alone
Since I met you
You keep me on my toes

Let's go somewhere
I got something I wanna show you
All you gotta do
Is say you want me and I'll be yours
Mmmm
All you gotta do
Is say you want me
And I'll be yours
I'll be yours

All you gotta do
Is say you want me
And I'll be yours
I'll be yours

Keep your secrets
I like what I know
Keep me guessing
And I'll just keep you close
Yeah

Let's go somewhere
I got something I wanna show you
All you gotta do

Is say you want me and I'll be yours
Mmmm
All you gotta do
Is say you want me
And I'll be yours
I'll be yours
All you gotta do
Is say you want me
And I'll be yours
I'll be yours

Let's go somewhere
I got something I wanna show you
All you gotta do
Is say you want me and I'll be yours
(And I'll be yours)
All you gotta do
Is say you want me
And I'll be yours
I'll be yours
All you gotta do
Is say you want me
And I'll be yours
I'll be yours
