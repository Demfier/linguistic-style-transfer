Hey, girl, this yo song, let's see that padonkpadodon
I'mma try to do the things that you don't
Baby, it's yo party, I just wanna play
What's that sound? What's that thang that's got me like wow?
I'm tryna beat beat it up third rounds
Girl, look at that body, I just gotta say

When you back back back back back it up
And you drop it down low
And you pick pick pick pick pick it up
Girl, I'm ready to blow
I'mma stack stack stack stack stack it up
And I'm spending it all
When I throw throw throw throw it up

Start twerkin' like Miley (x6)

You got everybody in this club lookin' at you girl
How you move that thing from side to side
F**k everybody in this club, cause I got you girl
I'mma tell you what's goin' down tonight
Girl, it's gon' rain, that's that sound
That's that sh*t that's got you like wow
And would you let me beat beat twelve rounds
Baby, look at that body, I just gotta say

When you back back back back back it up
And you drop it down low
And you pick pick pick pick pick it up
Girl, I'm ready to blow
I'mma stack stack stack stack stack it up
And I'm spending it all
When I throw throw throw throw it up

Start twerkin' like Miley (x6)
