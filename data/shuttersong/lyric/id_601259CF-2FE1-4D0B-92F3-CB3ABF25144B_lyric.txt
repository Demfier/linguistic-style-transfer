Opening: 1, 2, 3...

#1 - Harry:
Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
A big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh, but we don't listen

Pre-Chorus - Louis:
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa

Reff - All:
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you & me, stumbling in the street
Singing x4
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

#2 - Liam & Niall:
5 foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby follow me
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old shh, but a different day

Back to Pre-Chorus

Reff - All:
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you & me, stumbling in the street
Singing x4
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

Bridge - Niall & Harry:
You & me & all our friends, I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for
I know nothing's making sense, for tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop so give me more

Reff - All:
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you & me, stumbling in the street
Singing x4
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
