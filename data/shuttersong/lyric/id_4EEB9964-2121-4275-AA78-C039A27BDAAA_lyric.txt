Weak I have been crying and crying for weeks
how'd I survive when I can barely speak
Barely eat on my knees
But that's the moment you came to me
I don't know what your loves done to me
Think I'm invincible I see
Through the me
I used to be
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing
To me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman you did this to me
Superhuman all things in me
I think it's time I'm here with you
Superhuman
Superhuman
Superhuman
Strong since I've been flying and writing the wrongs
Feels like almost had it all along I can see tomorrow
But every problem is gone because I've flown everywhere but love inside of me
It's unbelievable to see
How love can set me free
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing
To me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman you did this to me
Superhuman all things in me
I think it's time I'm here with you
Superhuman
Superhuman
It's not a bird, not a plane.
It's my heart and its going going away
My only weakness is you
Only reason is you
Every minute with you
I feel like I can do anything
going going I'm gone away in love
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing
To me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman you did this to me
Superhuman all things in me
I think it's time I'm here with you
Superhuman
Superhuman
