If I could write you a song,
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
Its probably 'cause,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around,
Like they ain't wrong.
But you don't know,
The way that you look,
When your steps

All figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up
Who you really are
Who you think that you are

Switch in your walk,
And you don't even look when you pass by.

All figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up
Who you really are
Who you think that you are

'Cause it sure seems
('Cause it sure seems)
You got no doubt
(That you got no doubt)
But we all see
You got your head in the clouds
