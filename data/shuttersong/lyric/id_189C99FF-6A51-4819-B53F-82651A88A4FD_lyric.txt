Come Together - Michael Jackson\n Heree ol' flat top\n Hee groovin' up slowly\n He's got Joo Joo eyeball\n He one holy roller\n He got hair down to his knees\n Got to be a joker he just do what he please\n He wear no shoeshine\n He's got toe jam football\n He's got monkey finger\n He shoot Coca-Cola\n He say "I know you  you know me"\n One thing I can tell you is you got to be free\n Come together right now over me\n He bag production\n He's got walrus gum-boot\n He's got Ono sideboard\n He one spinal cracker\n He got feet down through his knees\n Hold you in his armchair\n You can feel his disease\n Come together right now over me\n He roller coaster\n He's got early warning\n He's got muddy water\n He one Mojo filter\n He say "One and one and one is three"\n Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see\n Come together right now over me
