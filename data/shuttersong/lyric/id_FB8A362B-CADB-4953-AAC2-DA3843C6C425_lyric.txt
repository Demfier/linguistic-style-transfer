Up down
(Let it go)

Up it's Jessi down, they can't be me
They can't stop me, they can't copy my recipe
Down let it go

The dance floor, it knows me, radio ready
Got this on CD on repeat, you know you need me
I'm in ya speaker, the rhythm got bodies talking
You know you want to so let go
You hear it calling

The sound of art in motion, everybody get down
J.Marley comes around, dance floor shuts down

You wanna get into something
That ain't 'bout nothing, just let it go
Turn it up, I'll put it down
Get it up, I'll put it down, down

You hear the beat jumpin' through the speakers
They 'bout to blow
They burnin' up, I put it down
Turn it up, I'll put it down

They can't stop me, they can't copy my recipe
Down let it go

Go when the beat goes do just do what you hear
Let go of your troubles put that in the air
You want to so let go you hear it callin'
Forget the drama let that all be broken by

The sound of art in motion, everybody get down
J.Marley comes around, dance floor shuts down

You wanna get into something
That ain't 'bout nothing, just let it go
Turn it up, I'll put it down
Get it up, I'll put it down, down

Hear the beat jumpin' through the speakers
They 'bout to blow
They burnin' up, I put it down
Turn it up, I'll put it down

You wanna get into something
That ain't 'bout nothing, just let it go
Turn it up, I'll put it down
Get it up, I'll put it down, down

Hear the beat jumpin' through the speakers
They 'bout to blow
They burnin' up, I put it down
Turn it up, I'll put it down

Up it's Jessi down, they can't be me
Up it's Jessi down, they can't be me
They can't stop me, they can't copy my recipe
Down let it go

Everybody has their ups and downs
You just gotta let it go
We're right here, right now
Don't let it stop your show
So you should lay your cares on the radio

The sound of art in motion, everybody get down
J.Marley comes around, dance floor shuts down

You wanna get into something
That ain't 'bout nothing, just let it go
Turn it up, I'll put it down
Get it up, I'll put it down, down

Hear the beat jumpin' through the speakers
They 'bout to blow
They burnin' up, I put it down
Turn it up, I'll put it down

You wanna get into something
That ain't 'bout nothing, just let it go
Turn it up, I'll put it down
Get it up, I'll put it down, down

Hear the beat jumpin' through the speakers
They 'bout to blow
They burnin' up, I put it down
Turn it up, I'll put it down

Up it's Jessi down, they can't be me
Up it's Jessi down, they can't be me
They can't stop me, they can't copy my recipe
Down let it go

Up it's Jessi down, they can't be me
Up it's Jessi down, they can't be me
They can't stop me, they can't copy my recipe
Down let it go

They can't stop me, they can't copy my recipe
Down let it go
