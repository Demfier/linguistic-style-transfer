I see the look on your face
Telling me your story
You don't have to be alone

I love to see you smiling
Why you trying to hide it?
Don't you know you've got it all?

I... know when you're gone
Do you thin think and you live like you want?
I... know when you're gone
You're just looking for a little sign of love

I said
Hey!
Would you come with me
I said, hey, hey

Hey, hey
Hey!
Would you stay with me
I said hey, hey

Hey, hey
I said
Hey!

Would you come with me
I said, hey, hey
Hey, hey

Hey!
Would you stay with me
I said hey, hey
Hey, hey

I see the way you're moving
No need for introducing

You're everything a man could want
You and I, we both know
Only one way this goes
Baby let me take you home

I... know when you're gone
Do you think and you live like you want?
I... know when you're gone
All you're looking for is a little sign of love
I said
