Drift - Alina Baraz\n I only miss you when the sun goes down\n Oh, your voice is my favorite sound\n Swaying like the palm trees\n You and me we're poetry\n Painting stories with our lips\n You're like a wave washing over me\n Pulling me underneath\n Sinking slowly\n You're like a wave washing over me\n I'll stay underneath\n Drifting slowly\n Hey Hey\n Oh Hey\n Foreign feelings that I can't ignore\n Oh I never felt like this before\n What's a king without a queen\n You could be my everything\n Can't you see?\n You're like a wave washing over me\n Pulling me underneath\n Sinking slowly\n You're like a wave washing over me\n I'll stay underneath\n Drifting slowly\n Hey Hey\n Oh Hey\n Hey Hey\n Oh Hey
