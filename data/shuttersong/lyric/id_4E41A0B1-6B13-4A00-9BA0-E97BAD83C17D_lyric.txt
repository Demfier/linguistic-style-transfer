Take my hand, I'll teach you to dance
I'll spin you around, won't let you fall down
Would you let me lead, you can step on my feet
Give it a try, it will be alright.

The room's hush, hush
And now's our moment
Take it in, feel it all and hold it
Eyes on you, eyes on me

We're doing this right.
Cause lovers dance, when they're feeling in love
Spotlight shining, its all about us
It's oh, oh, all... about uh, uh, uh, us.
And every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling I've never felt but

It's all... about us
Suddenly... I'm feeling brave
I don't know what's got into me
Why I feel this way

Can we dance, real slow?
Can I hold you, can I hold you close?
The room's hush, hush
And now's our moment

Take it in, feel it all and hold it
Eyes on you, eyes on me
We're doing this right.
Cause lovers dance, when they're feeling in love
Spotlight shining, its all about us
It's oh, oh, all... about uh, uh, uh, us.

And every heart in the room will melt
This is the feeling I've never felt but
It's all... about us

Do you hear that love? They're playing our song
Do you think we're ready? Oh, I'm really feeling it
Do you hear that love? Do you hear that love?

Do you hear that love? They're playing our song
Do you think we're ready yet? Oh, I'm really feeling it
Do you hear that love? Do you hear that love?

Do you hear that love? They're playing our song
Do you think we're ready yet? Oh, I'm really feeling it
Do you hear that love? Do you hear that love?
Lovers dance when they're feeling in love
Spotlight's shining. It's all about us
It's oh, oh, all

Every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling I've never felt
But it's all about us
'Cause lovers dance when they're feeling in love
Spotlight's shining. It's all about us
It's oh, oh, all
Hey, hey, hey
(And every heart in the room will melt)
This is a feeling I've never felt
But it's all about us
