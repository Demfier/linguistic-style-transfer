Bon Jovi - Have A Nice Day)\n Why you wanna tell me how to live my life\n Who are you to tell me if it s black or white\n Mama can you help me try to understand\n Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man\n My daddy lived a lie\n Its just the price that he paid\n Sacrificed his life just slaving away\n Ohhh if there s one thing I hang onto\n That gets me through the night\n I ain't gonna do what I don t want to\n I'm gonna live my life\n Shining like a diamond\n Rolling with the dice\n Standing on the ledge\n Just show the wind how to fly\n When the world gets in my face\n I say have a nice day\n Have a nice day\n Take a look around you nothings what it seems\n We re living in a broken home of hopes and dreams\n Let me be the first to shake your helping hand\n Everybody brave enough to take a stand\n I knocked on every door on every dead end street\n Looking for forgiveness\n What s left to believe\n Ohhh if there s one thing I hang onto\n That gets me through the night\n I ain't gonna do what I don t want to\n I'm gonna live my life\n Shining like a diamond\n Rolling with the dice\n Standing on the ledge\n Just show the wind how to fly\n When the world gets in my face\n I say have a nice day\n Have a nice day\n Ohhh \n Ohhh if there s one thing I hang onto\n That gets me through the night\n I ain't gonna do what I don t want to\n I'm gonna live my life\n Shining like a diamond\n Rolling with the dice\n Standing on the ledge\n Just show the wind how to fly\n When the world gets in my face\n I say have a nice day\n Have a nice day\n Have a nice day\n Now when this world keeps trying to drag me down\n I've gotta raise my hands\n Gonna stand my ground\n I say hey have a nice day\n Have a nice day\n Have a nice day
