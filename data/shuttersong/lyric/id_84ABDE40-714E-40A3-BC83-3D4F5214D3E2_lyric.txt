Think I can fly
Think I can fly when I'm with U
My arms are wide
Catching fire as the wind blows

I know that I'm rich enough for pride
I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if we're strangers till we die

I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away
Just U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
Just U and I

U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I

Oh
U, U, U, U

I wanna run
Chase the morning sun when I'm with U
Give it all away
Catching fire as the wind blows

I know that I'm rich enough for pride
I see a billion dollars in your eyes
Even if we're strangers till we die

I wanna run away
I wanna run away
Anywhere out this place
I wanna run away
Just U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
Just U and I

U and (U) I, I, I
Just U and I

I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
U and I, I, I, I, I
Just U and I

U and (U) I, I, I
Oh
U, U, U, U
