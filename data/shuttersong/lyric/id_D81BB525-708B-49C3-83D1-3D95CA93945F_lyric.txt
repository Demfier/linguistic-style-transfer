I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes
I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' keep from goin' under
Baby, you turn the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
C'mon girl
I fell so fast
Can't hold myself back
High heels, red dress
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath
I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' keep from goin' under
Baby, you turn the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
Walk in the room all I can see is you
Oh, you're starin' me down I know you feel it too
I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' keep from goin' under
Baby, you turn the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
Slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' keep from goin' under
Baby, you turn the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
Yo, we're burnin' up in this place tonight
Your Brothers sing it loud and we're feelin' right
Get up and dance, don't try and fight it
Big Rob is for real and that's no lie
Stop, drop and roll and touch your toes
It keeps on burnin' up, more and more
I got JB with me playin' it down
Come on boys, let's bring the around
I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' keep from goin' under
Baby, you turn the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
