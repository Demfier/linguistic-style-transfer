There once was a time
When everything was just so perfect
Now everything has changed
And you've become a total stranger
I've seen another side to you
I never even knew existed

Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Givin' in to your primal instincts

Another taste is what you're lookin' for
There's nothin' left so you can't take anymore
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat, you're like an animal
In for the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat, you're an animal

There once was a time
When anything I do is for you
But everything has changed
And I become a lonely prisoner
I'd kill, even die for you
You never even tried resisting

Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Givin in to your primal instincts

Another taste is what you're lookin' for
There's nothin' left so you can't take anymore
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat, you're like an animal
In for the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat, you're an animal
You're an animal

Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets

Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Another taste is what you're lookin' for
There's nothin' left so you can't take anymore
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat, you're like an animal
In for the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat, you're like an animal
In for the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat, you're an animal
