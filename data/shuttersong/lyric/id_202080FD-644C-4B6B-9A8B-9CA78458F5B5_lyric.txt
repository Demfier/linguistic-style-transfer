I can get you to that vulnerable state I swear you're so submissive
The one to make you feel that way, you know that I was missin'
Know you can't keep going through the day waitin' on me to hit ya
Just be patient with me, girl those places I could take you
I could take you
I could take you
I could take you
I could take you

Here you go hit me with the same line
With the same line
Don't you know I'm nothing like your last guy
Like your last guy (I'm better)
Got em all beat by a land slide, girl you can't lie (yeah you know it)
Do it make you feel right? No
Don't you know you was all mine? (I don't know)
See the places I might take you
Your life I could change it
I might make you famous
Just say the word
I can arrange it
You used to be good not now misbehaving
Look at you, got a crib in the hills we can rendezvous
And we can do whatever whenever you want to
So what you gonna do? What you gonna do?
I can take you

I can get you to that vulnerable state I swear you're so submissive
The one to make you feel that way, you know that I was missin'
Know you can't keep going through the day waitin' on me to hit ya
Just be patient with me, girl those places I could take you
I could take you
I could take you
I could take you
I could take you

I can take you to those places that you dream about
Girl there ain't no fallen once we on this cloud
Just gimme your attention I could show you how
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Only good vibrations
We're moving slow motion don't arrest the situation
Put you on a lear
That's a mile high occasion
Only heading up baby ain't no limitation
And you feel it I know
I can hold you down no matter how high you go
There you go
There you go
There you go
I could take you
There you go
There you go
Well, I could take you
I could take you
I could take you
I could take you
I could take you, I could take you

Ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
Ain't no ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
Ain't no ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
Ain't no ain't no falling down when we when we on this cloud
(Ain't no) falling down
