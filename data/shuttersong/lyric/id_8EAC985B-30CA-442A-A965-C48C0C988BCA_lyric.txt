Hubcaps and ashtrays
I was born but I wasn't raised
The big wheel the black space
Tried my best but wasn't praised

Hell is so close to Heaven
Hell is so close to Heaven
Hold on, don't look back
You know we're better we're better than that
Lost and thrown away
You know we're better we're better than that
We are the strays (woah oh oh)
We are the strays

Train tracks to the stage
Play that role, the one you made
Long nights and the worst days
Lived it all, but I didn't break
Hell is so close to Heaven

Hell is so close to Heaven
Hold on, don't look back
You know we're better we're better than that
Lost and thrown away

You know we're better we're better than that
We are the strays (woah oh oh)

We are the strays
My whole life they said I'd be nothing
Well I'm something
And I would rather be the stray
Than be nothing to no one at all
Hubcaps and ashtrays
I was born but wasn't raised
Hold on, don't look back
You know we're better we're better than that
Lost and thrown away
You know we're better we're better than that
Cause we are the strays (woah oh oh)
We are the strays
