Do you feel the love in this room tonight It might just be the night of your life

1:
It wasn't that long ago
Grandma was the only one that dug my flow
way before love below
I was just an outkast tryna find my soul
then came rock n roll
Red Hot Chili Peppers on the radio
can't stop, addicted to the music
can't stop, addicted to the music
sometimes we wanna do it
and people say we shouldn't
they say congratulate it
same cats that said we couldn't
the proof is in the puddin'
love is the movement,
a universal language
and we all speak it fluent

Do you feel the love in this room tonight
Do you feel the love in this room tonight
it might just be the night of your life
Do you feel the love in this room tonight
Do you feel the love in this room tonight
it might just be the night of your life

When I fall like dominoes
I get back up like vamanos
got a six pack and a bomb of O.
G with my homies vibin yo
the weight of the world is a heavy load
and chasin' a girl is a merry-go-round
round and round
round we go
here we go now

sometimes we all act stupid
do something just to do it
I made a few mistakes
but I stay smilin' through it
the proof is in the pudding
love is the movement,
a universal language
and we all speak it fluent

Repeat it might just be the night of your life Do you feel the love in this room tonight it might just be the night of your life
