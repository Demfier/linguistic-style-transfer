What you gotta loose
Go and make your luck with the luck you choose
If you want it all
Lay it on the line.

It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time.

Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.

So you gotta live it big time.
Look around
Every life is shining now
It's brighter somehow.
Look around
Nothing's really as it seems
Nothing but dreams.
You and I
Gonna make a brand new sound
Like we own this town.
We can fly
Now I made it off the ground
and never look down.
Welcome to the big time
All the pretty people see me walking in the sunshine.
Welcome to the good times
Life will never be the same...
Go and shake it up
What you gotta loose
Go and make your luck with the luck you choose
If you want it all
Lay it on the line.
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time.
Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
If you want it all
Lay it on the line.
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time!
