Don't tell me that you love me
I won't tell you that I love you
Would you had seen the wrong way
To find on the right way, oh no

The truth is
I'm freaking out about this whole
Man I'm supposed to be
I'm nervous now cause she can't know
I'm desperately in need
'Cause up here is hard to reach
Fly down, fly down

We were staring down the 'proudly
When she put her arm a- 'round me
She said the reason you've been hurt is
So you look beyond the surface

The truth is
I'm freaking out about this whole
Man I'm supposed to be
I'm nervous now cause she can't know
I'm desperately in need
'Cause up here is hard to reach
Fly down, fly down
Fly down
Don't tell me that you love me
I won't tell you that I love you
