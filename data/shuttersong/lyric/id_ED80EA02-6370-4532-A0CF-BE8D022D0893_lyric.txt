Artist by: Ella Fitzgerald
Listen to my tale of woe,
Its terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evning Im awfly blue.
I must win some handsome guy
Cant go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. so...
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfly misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
Im all alone in this big city
I tell you Im just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
Oh, please have some pity
Im all alone in this big city
I tell you Im just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
Oh lady be good to me.
