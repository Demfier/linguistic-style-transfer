.She don't like the flash
wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame
hate it when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where

it's too much for her
wanna throw us all away
cause it's too much for her
She cant hide away cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, She don't
Don't wanna share with no one else

want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She's giving ultimatums

she don't like this life, yeah
She said if I loved her
I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that

And it's getting to the point
where it's too much for her

Wanna throw it all away
cause it's too much for her
She don't wanna live this life

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
Don't wanna share no one else
want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
Why cant I choose between the two
One of the nights I'll run right now
I wish she could see
How good this can be
I hope that she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life
without her by my side
She gets the light that is in me
But she don't know
she don't know
She don't like the lights
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
