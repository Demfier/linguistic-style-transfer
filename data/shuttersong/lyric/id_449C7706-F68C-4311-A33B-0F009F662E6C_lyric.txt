I know you see me now right now
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now
(You see)
I know you see me now right now
(Right now)
I know you see me now right now

I got my suit and tie
And I don't know if y'all know
Well, maybe y'all do
Or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care
It's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money
Let's go

Now, I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolately
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cool
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods!
That nigga crazy, I told you!
Immature adult (uh huh), insecure asshole (what else?)
And if you fall on the concrete, that's yo' ass fault
If you pass on a Kon beat, that's yo' last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that's yo' ass, so
She got a big booty, but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take yo' last ho, and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettin' money, they be all up on yo' ass, yo
When you gettin' money Kons don't let a nigga pass go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hell hole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I say hello
Ask him if I'ma be there soon and tell 'im I said \
