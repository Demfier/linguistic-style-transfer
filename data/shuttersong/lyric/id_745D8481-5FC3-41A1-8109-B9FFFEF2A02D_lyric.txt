When I show up they all steppin' aside
And I'm rappin' the 4-0-2, it's just me and my squad (OGOC)
And we grindin' until we dead or we buried alive
Takin' shots like lebron yeah, this shit just happens
I don't even try now we blowin' up like Vietnam
Boom, I bring the party to the room
Maybe one or maybe two bottles comin' through
These other dudes they can't spit it like me
