Got on all my ice
talking' cash shit
Been balling all my life
Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and

Deserves a boss
Who down to provide
We run ther steets
But on G5's, I'm talkin' fly
Boots and blue jeans
Cartier, newer rings
you with a big boy
So we do the big things
Had to valet park it

Chanel hoodie on
Looking like
Trayvon Martin
George Zimmerman
Don't want it
She on my wanted poster
Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm ballin' like Lebron
We shoppin' in Milan
the 458 Ferrari
I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue
She blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive
Her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction

I swear I'm through with chronic
Rozay and Usher Raymond
Girl we the hottest
Rocking the most ice
I said we the hottest.
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING
ALL NIGHT LONG
THAT YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TO GET ME HOME ALONE
WHAT YOU GON' DO TO ME

DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
BE ABOUT IT
LEMME SEE
