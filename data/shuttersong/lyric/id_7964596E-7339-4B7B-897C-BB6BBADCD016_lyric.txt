

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
I'm not moving, I'm not moving

People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
(So I'm not moving)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
(I'm not moving)
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
(I'm not moving)
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
(I'm not moving)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
