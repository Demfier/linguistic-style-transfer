"The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)"

[Verse 1:]
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near,
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me,
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah I wanted to be the melody,
Above the noise, above the hurt.

[Pre-Chorus:]
I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus:]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.

[Verse 2:]
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain, and give it a name

[Pre-Chorus:]
I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus:]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.

[Bridge:]
We can hear you
We can hear you
We can hear you

[Chorus:]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will someday be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Outro:]
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
