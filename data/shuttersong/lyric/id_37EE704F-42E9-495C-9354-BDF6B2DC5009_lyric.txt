[Brittany:]
Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it

[The Cheerios:]
I want you

[Santana:]
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got

[Artie:]
One less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you

[Santana with the Cheerios:]
I got one less, one less problem

[Brittany:]
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up

[The Cheerios:]
But it's you

[Brittany:]
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back

[The Cheerios:]
But I do

[Santana with Brittany:]
Every time you touch me
And say you love me

[Quinn:]
I get a little bit breathless

[Santana with Brittany:]
I shouldn't want it

[The Cheerios:]
But I do

[Santana with Brittany:]
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got

[Artie:]
It's Iggy Iggs
Uh, what you got?

[Santana (with The Cheerios):]
(Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you)
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know but I (really, really doubt you)
Understand my life (is easy when I ain't around you)

Iggy, Iggy to biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you (more than I love your presence)
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
(I let you go, let you back), I finally learned my lesson

(No half-stepping, either you want it or you just playin')
I'm listening to you knowin' (I can't believe what you're sayin')
There's a million you's, baby boo, (so don't be dumb)
(I got 99 problems but you won't be one)
(Like what)

[Santana (The Cheerios):]
Ooh (One less, one less problem)
Ooh (One less, one less problem)
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders (One less, one less problem)

[Santana with Brittany and Quinn:]
I should be wiser and realize that I've got

[Artie (Santana):]
One less problem without you ([Brittany:] Hey)
I got one less problem without you (Oh, babe)
I got one less problem without you (Hoo!)

[The Cheerios:]
I got one less, one less problem ([Santana:] Hooh, baby)

[Artie:]
One less problem without you ([Brittany:] Yeah, yeah)
I got one less problem without you ([Santana:] Hooh, hey)
I got one less problem without you

[Santana with The Cheerios:]
I got one less, one less problem ([Santana:] Oooh)

[Artie (with Brittany):]
One less problem without you ([Santana:] Hey)
I got one less problem (without you, uh) ([Santana:] I got one less, one less, yeah)
I got one less problem without you

[The Cheerios (with Santana):]
I got one less, one less (problem, yeah)
