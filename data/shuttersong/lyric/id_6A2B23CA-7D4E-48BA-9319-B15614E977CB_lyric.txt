When she's O.K
And I'm all right
When she's awake
I'm up all night
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

I see her face
And in my mind
I seize the day
Whenever she's nearby
It's like nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

She completes me
Beside she reads me
Right or wrong

It's so clear she's
All that I need
All I need

I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
Swimming through the stars when I see her
And I don't need air cause I breathe her

I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I breathe her
I breathe her
Every time I see her
Every time I see her, oh

When I'm lost
And need a sign
She leads the way
And I'll be fine
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters

She completes me
Beside she reads me
Right or wrong

It's so clear she's
All that I need
All I need, yeah

I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
Swimming through the stars when I see her
And I don't need air cause I breathe her

I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I breathe her
I breathe her
Every time I see her
Every time I see her, oh

Every time I see her, oh
Every time I see her, oh

When she's ok
And I'm all right
When she's awake
I'm up all night
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
