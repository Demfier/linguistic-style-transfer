Sometime Somebody real is hard to find
Somebody worth all your time.
Somebody who to tell you the truth.
Someone who loves you for you.
Someone who knows all of your flaws and
Doesn't impose, try to control them.
Let's you be free
Doesn't deceive and
Gives you a chance to believe
Believe in something.
Is that too much?
Cause I've been on a search and I'm losing my hope
Is that too much? Is that too much?
Trying to find love in a world so cold
Is that too much?
I just want an answer, I can't be the only one
Is that too much?
You ain't got to be perfect
Just give me a purpose to love.
I just want somebody(body)
To treat me like somebody(body)
Won't be like everybody(body)
All you got to do is love me for me baby.
I just want somebody (body)
To treat me like somebody (body)
Wont be like everybody (body)
All you gotta do is love me for me baby
Now don't be mislead
By the things that I said in the past
I was young
I was looking for a thrill.
That didn't last long
I was in it for the wrong
Wrong reason, wrong season, wrong person(yeah).
Cause he just wanted one thing
And I just wanted something to smile at, and live for, and hug on(ohh).
I'd rather have quality than quantity
Oh, I just want someone that'll keep it real with me!
Is that too much?
Cause I've been on a search and I'm losing my hope
Is that too much? Is that too much?
Trying to find love in a world so cold
Is that too much?
