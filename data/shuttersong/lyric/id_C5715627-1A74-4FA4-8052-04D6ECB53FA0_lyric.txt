 Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get (uhh, watch me)
At any, chance you hit (that's right) we live for  the moment
(yo, watch, watch) Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
(Watch me) You see me around some cheese
(Watch me) See me with hustlers around them G's
(Watch me) Blowin 'dro runnin through pounds  of weed
(Watch me) At  the bar baby, round's on me
(Watch me)
Watch me turn somethin out  of nothin, turn platinum from gold
Watch me light  the Cohiba off  the Viking stove
I take an empty bank account, fill it with oh's
I take an empty building then I fill it with hoes
Watch me, cop that Coupe, shine for  the ladies
Have em sayin, "Damn I never seen a watch that blue"
And while they still mesmerized I pop that cooch'
Shit, law enforcement couldn't stop that dude
Guess who? Fresh off  of "Volume 2"
Back at you, peep  the numbers my album do
They call me Cham-pagne-hovah, wake up with a hangover
When y'all think  the game's over, do  the same thing over
Still with  the same soldiers
Still gettin brain and it's plain ain't a thang gon' change over
Hop out  the truck, hand on my cock and nuts
Who got  the bank, I'm stoppin it up, watch me
and tell me you won't ball every chance you get (watch me)
At any, chance you hit, we live for  the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
(Watch me) At  the bar bitch, round's on me
Yo  the watch too rocky, need shades
Continental sittin on blades, spinnin like waves
Gun too Brock-y, behave
Big shot, plus I'm feelin like Rocky these days
Ice don't melt I could ski through a heatwave
Nights won't help you see Jay, it'll be day
My shit too bright, I rip through mics
plus I push more powder than Crystal Light
Chick mad, said I hold my pistol too tight
Get a grip bitch, this how I get through life
I buy out  the bar, spit Crist' through  the mic
See Jigga  in  the 6 and all  the shit you like
See Jigga givin dick to every bitch you like
I told her, "It's Jay-Day and Hit-You-Night"
You wanna, see me again
