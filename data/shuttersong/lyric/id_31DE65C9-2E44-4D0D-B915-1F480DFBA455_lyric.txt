
(Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home, no way, no way, never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home, no way)

I can't stop, never let a hater
Kill your dreams, 19, I got paper
Katniss Everdeen
Odds always in my favor
I pull up on the scene, black tee and a Blazer
Won't chase a woman, I re-place
I'll make you have deja vu when I walk by
Like, "Hey it's that guy! Yeah aren't you from Vine?"
Hell nah I'm from Nebraska, get your facts aligned
But I ain't gonna lie, Jack and Jack
Did blow up on the app but we're more than that
The best duo in LA since Kobe-Shaq
They need a whole demolition just to hold us back
Run circles around the competition, cul-de-sac
Legs keep burnin' but it's so worth it
When you're young and earnin' money like a surgeon
Yeah it's cool and all but spreadin' love's my purpose

So who is gon' tell me I can't do
Anything I put my mind to
Now I ain't tryna hear it
Bitch get up out my ear

I'm just a Midwest kid dreamin' California
One way ticket cause I had to show you
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way

I'm fresh up in the game and I'm here to stay
Don't really got my shit together, just appear this way
And I'm like everybody else, I got fears to face
Nowadays even the real are just as real as fakes
And nobody's really what they seem
Learned that the hard way, cuts run deep
And these millions of people put their trust in me
Man I got a lot of pressure but I must succeed
So Imma keep grindin' and workin', I'm finally certain
My life is not meant to be wasted
The line of success all these people be tracin'
That shit, it ain't me, Imma pave my own way
And I'm a little unorthodox, I can't lie
No I ain't gonna conform I rock my own style
Tell that to the fans and everybody by side
Yo we're headed to the top and you should keep a close eye

So who's gon' tell me I can't do
Anything I put my mind to
Now I ain't tryna hear it
Bitch get up out my ear

I'm just a Midwest kid dreamin' California
One way ticket cause I had to show you
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way

Before I touched down, thought I had it all
Now it's midnight sessions, playin' basketball
My friends and my family, Imma have to call
And tell 'em I'm never goin' home, yeah I'm never goin' home
No way

Midwest kid dreamin' California
One way ticket cause I had to show you
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way
