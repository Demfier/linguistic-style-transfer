We "won the War"; 
We made a temple to thieves Enshrining the great criminal 
Who promised heaven without God. 
If we had sight to seem to see the seven seas could cease to be or freeze in me. 
We'd shake this sudden sundering and subsequently cross the strait and traverse the wastes. 
We'll beat our rifles to shovels and dig a proper grave for our sons 
Who saw the end of God: Wasteland 
The flag will fall 
With the wall we built: Wasteland. 
Apostate to the State Witness to the Dead: 
For you know only a heap of broken Image 
And when you rid this earth of God
We shall shelter Him underground. 
Fall into the coldest wastes of humanity 
Darkening circles fed by deepening graves. 
"Death solves all problems" 
Your heart is a statistic. 
No mother, no resistance... 
But still she precludes the grave. 
They saw the end of God: Wasteland. 
The flag will fall With the walls we built:
Wasteland
Wasteland.
