Decisions (feat  Miley Cyrus) - Borgore
Decisions  but I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
You should have learned how to bake 
Yes I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
You should have learned bitches love cake  
Decisions  but I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
You should have learned how to bake 
Yes I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
You should have learned how to bake Decisions 
Between a family or a porn star
I'm alive for sports cars  live it or die whole bar
Headache for my management  gossip columns resident
Your mom and dad might hate me
But in five years I'm the president I wanna girl  I get her 
And I get her friend
Five girls singing in my bedroom  start my own band
They love me in my peak  but this love is fake
Everyday's my birthday 
'Cause bitches love cake 
Decisions 
But I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
You should have learned how to bake 
Yes I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
You should have learned bitches love cake
