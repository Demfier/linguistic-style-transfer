My tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And i can't see at all
And even if i could it' d all be grey,
But your picture on my wall it reminds me
That it's not so bad, it's not so bad.

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay,
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today,
I'm late for work again and even if i'm there,
They'll all imply that i might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

Chorus

And i want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life

Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life.

Push the door, i'm home at last and i'm soaking
Through and through then you handed me a towel
And all i see is you, and even if my house falls
Down now, i wouldn't have a clue because you're
Near me

Chorus

And i want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life,
Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life. (x2)
