Why do people lie?
why do they hurt each other?
why do nations fight?
how could color matter
why do people envy?
worship so much greed
make a more and make a live in peace

so lets get along, lets get along any other way just has to be wrong
its not there world or my world, cause its our world
so lets get along and learn to live in peace

so many people have so much while the rest has more than less
where ever guns are sold you know what happens next,
half the world is starving while we are throwing food away
its time to stop and think and make a change

so lets get along, lets get along any other way just has to be wrong
its not there world or my world, cause its our world
so lets get along and learn to live in peace

maybe one day
we will come to our senses
that when we'll see there's no difference in our differences
then we can mend those broken faces and get along

lets get along
so lets get along, lets get along any other way just has to be wrong
its not there world or my world, cause its our world
so lets get along and learn to live in peace

get along, cause right is wrong the bridge in our world
that we can stop,
its not yours not there's not my world cause its our world
so lets get along and learn to live in peace

get along
get along
