You won't find me here, the place that you expected me to be
In my bed on the second floor
I'm outside your house
I'm closing in on you

And all the times you smiled
You said hello and thought I was ok
I was planning your final struggle

{Chorus}
When you wake up I'll be there
When you see me you'll be on your back again
When you know you're already dead, you'll love me too

You will find me here
The place you least expected me to be
Breaking through your basement window
I'm outside your room, I can hear you breathe
And all the times you laughed
You shook my hand and thought I was your friend
I was planning your tragic ending

When you wake up I'll be there
When you see me you'll be on your back again
When you know you're already dead, you'll love me too

You'll look down on me
With eyes of endless tragedy
Try and stop the pain
But there's never closure
Find your solace in what you could have been

When they look for me
The evidence is buried deep
Try to guide the way into the darkness

When you wake up I'll be there
When you see me you'll be on your back again
When you know you're already dead, you'll love me too

Looking down on me through eyes that never stop crying
Looking down on me, will you ever look away?
