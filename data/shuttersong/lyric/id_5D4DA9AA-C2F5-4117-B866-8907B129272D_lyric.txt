All For Love - Madison Beer  Jack & Jack\n I'm looking for places to run and hide\n I'll never forget you Lord knows I've tried\n Wish I could see you without closing my eyes\n But I know I know it's so far behind\n Fading out fading out can't get right\n I'm tossing out turning out every night\n I'm losing my losing my goddamn mind\n Ask me why I did it ask me why I did it I said\n All for love\n Ask me why I did it I said\n All for love\n Ask me why I did it I said\n I've run out of tears I've run out of breath\n It's crazy the truth hurts way more than the lie\n Fading out fading out can't get right\n I'm tossing out turning out every night\n I'm losing my losing my goddamn mind\n Ask me why I did it ask me why I did it I said\n All for love\n Ask me why I did it I said\n All for love\n Ask me why I did it I said\n All for love all for love all for love\n All for love all for love all for love\n All for love\n Ask me why I did it I said\n When I'm away from her the times slow\n And I ain't leaning on a double cup of Styrofoam\n She got me fiendin' you wanna know the reason she really fly though\n She gets me high but I ain't got to hide her from the five-O\n And when her name pops up on my iPhone I'm still mind blown\n That this love is diamonds no rhinestone\n Cause what we got's for real\n And I forget what day of week it is when I'm with her\n She got me doing crazy things without a drop of liquor\n Drunk in love this can't be good for my liver\n She's the only one who keeps me off Instagram and Twitter\n And everybody keeps on asking me just why I did it\n So I tell 'em\n All for love\n I did it all for love man I swear I did it all for love\n Ask me why I did it I said\n All for love\n I did it all for love\n Ask me why I did it I said\n All for love all for love all for love\n I did it all for love\n All for love all for love all for love\n Yeah I did it all for love\n All all for love for I did it all for love love\n Ask me why I did it I said
