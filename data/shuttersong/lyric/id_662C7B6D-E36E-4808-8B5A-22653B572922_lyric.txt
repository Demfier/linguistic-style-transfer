Yo, B, they ready
Lets go

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it
And a good girl in my tax bracket

Got a black card that let Saks have it
These Chanel bags is a bad habit
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks, my Maybach, black magnet
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it
And I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit
Feelin' myself, back off, cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
Heard he thinks about me when he whacks off
Whacks on? Wacks off
National anthem hats off, then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Lemme get a number 2, with some Mac sauce
Or On The Run Tour, with my mask off
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Changed the game with that digital drop
Know where you was when that digital popped

I stopped the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world stop...
Carry on
Kitty on pink, pretty on fleek
Pretty gang, always keep them niggas on geek

Ridin' through Texas, fearin' for his breakfast
Everytime I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said \
