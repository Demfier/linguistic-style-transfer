Don't talk
Let me think it over
How are we gonna fix this?
How are we gonna undo all the pain?

Tell me
Is it even worth it?
Looking for a straight line
Taking back the time we can't replace

All the crossed wires
Just making us tired
Is it too late to bring us back to life?

When I close my eyes and try to sleep
I fall apart and find it hard to breathe
You're the reason the only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason the only reason

I feel you burning under my skin
I swear I see you shining
Brighter than the flame inside your eyes

Bitter words are spoken
Everything is broken
It's never too late
To bring us back to life

When I close my eyes and try to sleep
I fall apart and find it hard to breathe
You're the reason the only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason the only reason

Don't talk
Let me think it over
How are we gonna fix this?
How are we gonna undo all the pain?

When I close my eyes and try to sleep

When I close my eyes and try to sleep
I fall apart and find it hard to breathe
You're the reason the only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason the only reason
