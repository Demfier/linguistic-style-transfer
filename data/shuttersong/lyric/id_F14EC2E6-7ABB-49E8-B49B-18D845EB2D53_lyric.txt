I used to be a girlfriend
And I know I did it well
Oh yes you know its true
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell
And I'd be there for you
Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay
I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry  I've already made my wish
Ahaah  But Cinderella is got to go
From time to time
I'd try to tell just what was on my mind 
You'd tell me not today 
Come back  do that 
Well  Cinderella ah   
Was all you had to say
Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay
I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Ahaah  But Cinderella is got to go
I'm sorry just trying to live my life
Don't worry you are going to be alright
Ah  But Cinderella is got to go  
You use to say I want you
You cast me in your spell
I did everything you wanted me to do
But now I shout
First your reasons why you lie to me
I wont be blind you see
My love it can't be sacrificed
I won't pretend to be
I'm so sorry
I've already made up my mind
I won't return to you
I'm sorry to say
I'm running away now
Don't worry you will be alright   
I'm running away
I'm made up my mind now
You're gonna have to let me go
She is got to go
I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Ah  But Cinderella is got to go
I'm sorry just trying to live my life
Don't worry you are going to be alright
Ah  But Cinderella is got to go
