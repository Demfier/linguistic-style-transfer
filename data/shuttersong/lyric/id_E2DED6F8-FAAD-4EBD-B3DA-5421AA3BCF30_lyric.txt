Our story time is told
And I'm blinded by the afterglow
Can you hear me dear?
Now I'm thumbing through the pages

Of the beautifully romantic years
I can hear you, dear

'Cause right in front of me
You disappear
You're still vanishing
You left me here
I stand here today
So far from the same
It's hard to move on without you

So my God fill these spaces left in me
I'm too near to lost but I'm not
I'm so near to lost but I'm not alone
Dear daddy don't you miss me
Cause in heaven there's no room for tears

I can feel you here
And as I'm thumbing through the pages

Seems forever's just too far away
When we meet again
I'll remember when
Right in front of me
You disappeared
You're still vanishing
You left me here

I stand here today
So far from the same
Its hard to move on without you
So my God fill these spaces left in me
I'm too near to lost but I'm not
So near to lost but I'm not

All alone, not all alone
I'm not all alone, I'm not all alone
I stand here today
So far from the same
It's hard to move on without you
So my God fill these spaces left in me
I'm too near to lost but I'm not
I stand here today
So far from the same
It's hard to move on without you
So my God fill these spaces left in me
I'm too near to lost but I'm not
I'm everthing but lost cuz I'm not alone
