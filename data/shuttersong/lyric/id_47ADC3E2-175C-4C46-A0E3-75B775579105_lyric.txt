Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough

(Don't think I'll ever get enough)
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart

A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
