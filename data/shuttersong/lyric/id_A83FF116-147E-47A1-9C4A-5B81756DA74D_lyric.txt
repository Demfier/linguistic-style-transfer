No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do
To love me like you do

No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can keep me high I swear no one
Can love me like you do
Can love me like you do
ohh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ohhh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, oh nobody oh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth, like you, uuh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody

My oxygen can barely breathe
My darkest sin erase beliefs
And it's all because of you
All because of you
Not know what it is
But you pull me in
No one compares, could ever begin to love me like you do
I wouldn't want them to

Cause nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, ohh nobody ohh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, uhhh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, ohh nobody ohh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth, like you
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody

I don't want nothing else
Not when I've had the best
I don't want nothing else
Cause you've showed me the best

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, ohh nobody ohh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, ohh nobody ohh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth, like you, uhh
Nobody's gonna love me like you, uhhh
Nobody, nobody uh
