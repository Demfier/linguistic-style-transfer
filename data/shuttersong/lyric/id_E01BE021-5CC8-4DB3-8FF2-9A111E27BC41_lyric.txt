Everlasting Love
Always looking over my shoulder Cause I don't ever wanna miss me

I been thinking about you daily
I can't wait to see your face
I don't even know you
But I know that I can't wait to kiss you
Somehow I know when we finally lock eyes
That you'll feel the same way
You're gonna be all I've needed
You make me feel like a dream
Whoever you are
Baby you are
The one I'm waiting for
You're my ever everlasting love
My ever everlasting love
And I'm never ever giving up til your laying next to me
I'm lookin for that ever everlasting love
Forever ever kind of touch
And I'll never ever get enough
Baby we were meant to be
Ain't no use in wastin' my time on just anybody, baby
I want exceptional, original, someone I can't deny
I'm in love with you already, I know it sounds crazy
But I hope you save all you got for me
Cuz (baby) you're all mine
All mine
You're gonna be all I've needed
You make me feel like a dream
Whoever you are
Baby you are
The one I'm waiting for
You're my ever everlasting love
My ever everlasting love
And I'm never ever giving up til your laying next to me
I'm lookin for that ever everlasting love
Forever ever kind of touch
And I'll never ever get enough
Baby we were meant to be
Everlasting Love
Everlasting Love
Everlasting Love
My Everlasting Love
I don't even know your name
But I can't get you off my brain
Darling I can hardly wait
Til I can get to know you
You'll be beautifully insane
Infinitely all for me
Promise you'll be glad you came
I can't wait to show you
You're my ever everlasting love
My ever everlasting love
And I'm never ever giving up til your laying next to me
I'm lookin for that ever everlasting love
Forever ever kind of touch
And I'll never ever get enough
Baby we were meant to be
Everlasting Love
