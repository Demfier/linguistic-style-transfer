On a scale from one to ten
I am perfect like I am
I don't need your number
I don't need your number
And the stupid magazines
Want me to change my everything
It don't even matter
They're not taking my power (taking my power)
I'm so over all of these voices around
They've said enough, it's my turn, let's get loud.
I'll show you what a girl is
'cause all of me is perfect.
Who cares about a dress size
Its all about what's inside.
I'll stand up now
And won't back down.
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl is.
I'm feeling flawless in my skin
Your words don't mean anything.
I'm done wasting my time (done wasting my time)
I can make up my own mind. (can make up my own mind)
I'm so over all of these voices around
They've said enough, it's my turn, let's get loud.
I'll show you what a girl is
'cause all of me is perfect.
Who cares about a dress size
Its all about what's inside.
I'll stand up now
And wont back down.
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl is.
You are exactly what you're made to be, I swear.
Don't be afraid just to put yourself out there.
On a scale from 1-10, I am perfect like I am.
I don't need your number, we don't need your number.
I'll show you what a girl is
'cause all of me is perfect.
Who cares about the dress size
Its all about what's inside.
I'll stand up now, and won't back down.
We're breaking through the surface
