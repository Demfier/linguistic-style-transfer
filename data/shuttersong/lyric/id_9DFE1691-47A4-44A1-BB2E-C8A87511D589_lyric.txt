I love her, can't leave her,
Forever I'll always need her,
She lie, but I believe her,
Lovesick I got that fever.
Love stupid, I know it,
Love stupid, I know it,
I know, cause I'm a fool in love

My baby shot me down again,
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang
That girl's a killer from a gang,
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang

And oh, I love her so, that's why I gotta let her know
That I'll be here for her to always love her down.

And maybe that's the truth,
The clock can tick and ain't no use,
I wonder when my tux can see you when you're down

Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Oh, yeah, I love my baby
Hey baby yeah I love you,
Stupid is what stupid do,
Tom and Jerry and Scooby Do,
Oh baby, I'm a fool for you.
Come here, baby, be my lollypop,
I make it better, make the booty drop.
Hey baby, can't get you out my brains,
Damn girl, you're such a sexy thing.
Pretty little lady
And my baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down...

Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang,

Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
