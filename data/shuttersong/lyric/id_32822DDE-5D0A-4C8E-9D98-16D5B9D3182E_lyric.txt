Last night was crazy
And today it's heading in
Did you really mean it
And could you say it again? (Oh, oh)

Even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on ring, ring)
It makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid
But I'll take a chance, I'll listen

Hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
What you say, boy?
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth, girl it's only you
You're my only, you're my only

You're my only one and only
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)

I'm telling you the truth,(oh), girl it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, You're my only, you're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
Every day and night you got an open invitation
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me

I'll be your fantasy, (yeah)
You're in the mail
But baby, baby, so am I
But if you're weak and try to stink
I'll have to tell you bye, bye
I'mma put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
(What you say, boy)
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty (Am I your only, yeah?)

I'm telling you the truth, girl it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, You're my only one and only
(Am I your only, yeah?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)

I'm telling you the truth, (oh), girl it's only you (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, You're my only, you're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
Please baby, please give me all your attention, (say it)
Don't let my heart go seeking no other direction

I got it baby only one for your affection, (oh yeah)
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Baby, come clean)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh), girl it's only you, (whoa)

You're my only, you're my only, You're my only, you're my only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh), girl it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, You're my only, you're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
Am I your only?
Am I your only?
Tell me, am I your only shorty? (Yeah, yes you are)
Wanna hear you say yeah. (Yes you are)
Am I your only shorty?
