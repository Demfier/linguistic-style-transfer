You look so beautiful tonight
That smile your wearing so out of site
I'm I dreaming could this be real
I'm with a girl that makes me feel so good

I think I should
Tell you that I love you cause you know I could
Forever take care of you girl I wouldâ€¦
Do anything for you

And without you
What could I do?
There's no loving in the world
That could out beat you
Your my lover girl (owooh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl

With your kiss
How could I miss?
No local boy's ever felt like this
Your my lover girl (owooh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl

It takes time for me to see
How special a love could be
With you only took a minute
To play my heart so easily and win it
I Just wanna show (how much, how much)
I love you so (your touch, your touch)
Just made me fall so deep in love with you

And without you
What could I do?
There's no loving in the world
That could out beat you
Your my lover girl (owooh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl

With your kiss
How could I miss?
No local boy's ever felt like this
Your my lover girl (owooh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl

It's only been a little while (yeayeah)
Since I first seen your smile (yeah)
With you I feel so strong
Feels like nothing could go wrong
Because you're here with me...

Girl you looking fine and your one of a kind
You got that special something that makes you shine
Your my lover girl (owooh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl
Take another step everything's alright
I'll hold you in the day and all through the night
Your my lover girl (owooh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl (uhwoh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl (uhwoh oh ooh)
Your my lover girl...
