So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep â€˜em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I'm on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, \
