Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid

You were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain

Hey Jude, refrain

Don't carry the world upon your shoulder

For well you know that it's a fool

Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na naa-naa

na-na-naa naaa
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na naa-naa
na-na-naa naaa
Yeah
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song
And make it better
Remember to let her under your skin (got the wrong chord!)
Then you begin (fucking hell)
To make it better
Better, better, better, better, (I'm begging you) better
