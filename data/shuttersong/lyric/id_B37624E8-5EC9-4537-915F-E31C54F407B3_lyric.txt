Blinded by the lights
This movie ain't over
Take me by the hand
You feel a little colder

I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you down
The heart is taking control
There's no one around
We're fading away
Getting above the ground
We're fading away
Lost and not found
We're fading away yeah yeah, uh huh
Getting high off the ground
We're fading away yeah yeah, uh huh
Lost and not found

We gonna take the flight
Paper planes, getting rolled up
Our dreams hit the fan
The pain of getting older

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you down
The heart has taken control
There's no one around

We're fading away
Getting high off the ground
We're fading away
Lost and not found
We're fading away yeah yeah, uh huh
Getting high off the ground
We're fading away yeah yeah, uh huh
Lost and not found

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you down
The heart has taken control
There's no one around
There's no one around
There's no one around
There's no one around
There's no one around
There's no one around
There's no one around

We're fading away
Getting high off the ground
We're fading away
Lost and not found
We're fading away yeah yeah, uh huh
Getting high off the ground
We're fading away yeah yeah, uh huh
Lost and not found

We're fading away yeah yeah, uh huh
Lost and not found
