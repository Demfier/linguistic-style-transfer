"BO$$"

[Normani:]
Everyday is payday
Swipe my card, then I do the nae nae
You talking to a lady
I want a Kanye ye not a Ray J
So that's a no no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo's beat like Dre aye
I already know what you trying to say hey!

[Lauren:]
You say that you a baller
And I see you trying holla
But that ain't how I was brought up-next
Working for the money
'Cause that what my momma taught me
So yo ass better show me some re-spect

[Chorus x4:]

'Cause I already know watch you trying to say hey!
