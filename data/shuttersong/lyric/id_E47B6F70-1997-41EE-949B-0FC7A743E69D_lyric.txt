Count on Me (Originally Performed by Bruno Mars) (Vocal Version) - Singer's Edge Karaoke
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me like one two three i'll be there
And i know when i need it
I can count on you like four three two you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah oooooh oooooh yeah yeah
If you're tossinand you're turnin and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Everyday i will remind you
Oh
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me like one two three i'll be there
And i know when i need it
I can count on you like four three two you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah oooh oooh yeah yeah
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go never say goodbye
You know you can count on me like one two three i'll be there
And i know when i need it
I can count on you like four three two and you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah
Oooooh ooooooh
You can count on me cause i can count on you
