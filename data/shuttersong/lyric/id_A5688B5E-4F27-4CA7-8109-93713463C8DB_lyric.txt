She took my heart when I was fifteen
I love everything about you
And now I honestly can't see
Going a single day without you

You are the air I breath
You are my everything
Baby come and follow me
To the end of the world
I won't live a day without your love
I won't live a day without your love (no)

Yeah I've been flipping through the dictionary trying to find
A proper word that I could use to tell you what's on my mind
But baby this time different for me its a first
Cause now I'm sitting here with nothing but a loss for words
Its like you reset my heart and then erased my brain
The only thing that's not deleted in my head is your name
So doctor please give me some adderol I'm having trouble concentrating you hypnotized me mastered the art of captivating
So there you go
Bravo
Congratulations
A massive understatement if I said my heart was taken
Cause now I'm hooked I'll admit my hearts been pumping
I don't know how you did it but I love it

Cause you are the air I breath
You are my everything
Baby come and follow me
Till the end of the world
I won't live a day without your love
I won't live a day without your love (no)

I told myself a while ago I'd never let this happen
You way too young to fall in love
Just concentrate on rapping
But then you came along and all my plans rearranged
And then suddenly everything changed
Now you're my world my sun my moon and everything between them
Some people kinda scepticle but baby we don't need them
We can run away and never come back
Yeah we could leave today
Pick anywhere on the map
As long as you're by my side
I got a smile on my face
But when you're gone girl I swear I feel so out of place
I know you've heard it before
But I can't say it enough
I couldn't live a single day without you're love

Because you are the air I breath
You are my everything
Baby come and follow me
Till the end of the world
I won't live a day without your love
I won't live a day without your love (no)

She took my heart when I was fifteen
I love everything about you
And now I honestly cant see
Going a single day without you

you are the air I breath
You are my everything
Baby come and follow me
Till the end of the world
I won't live a day without your love
I won't live a day without your love (no)
