I can't stop, never let a hater
Kill your dreams, 19, I got paper
Katniss Everdeen, odds always in my favor
I pull up on the scene, black tee and a blazer
Won't chase a woman, I'll re-place her
Make ya have deja vu when I walk by
Like, "Hey it's that guy! Yeah aren't you from Vine?"
Hell nah I'm from Nebraska, get your facts aligned
But I ain't gonna lie, Jack and Jack
Did blow up on the app but we're more than that
The best duo in LA since Kobe-Shaq
They need a whole demolition just to hold us back
Run circles around the competition, cul-de-sacs
Legs keep burnin' but it's so worth it
When you're young and earning, money like a surgeon
Yeah it's cool and all but spreadin' love's my purpose

So who's gone tell me I can't do
Anything I put my mind to
Now I ain't tryna hear it
Bitch get up out my ear
I'm just a...
Midwest kid dreamin' California
One way ticket cause I had to show yah
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
