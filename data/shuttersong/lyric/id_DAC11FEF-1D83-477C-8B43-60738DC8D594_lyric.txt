Hmm, mmm, yeah

Sunrise and I lifted my head
Then I smiled at your picture sittin' next to my bed
Sunset and you're feelin' okay
'Cause you smile at the letter that I sent you today

And I can't wait till I see you again
And we'll both say, remember when
The band played on the 4th of July
And you held me on your shoulders way up high

You're still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea

But you can sleep tonight
Knowing it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song
You are with me
You've been here all along
You've been here all along

Back then you walked me to school
Told me to be careful and to follow the rules
Fast forward, you taught me to drive
You gave me the keys and we went for a ride

And I can't wait till I see you again
And we both say, remember when
I'm holdin' on to moments like that
I know that they're comin' back

You're still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea

But you can sleep tonight
Knowin' it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along
Yeah

All along the way I keep you
In my heart and in my breath
You'll always be the one who cares the most
Countin' all the days I see you
Runnin' up to say
I miss you, I miss you

You're still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea

But you can sleep tonight
Knowin' it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song

You're still there for me
Wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
But you can sleep tonight
Knowin' it's alright
I believe that you are listening to my song
You are with me
'Cause you're with me
You've been here all along
You've been here all along
Yeah
