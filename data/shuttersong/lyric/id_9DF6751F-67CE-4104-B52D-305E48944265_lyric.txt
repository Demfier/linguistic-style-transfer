Illusion (DAB Full Vocal) - Benassi Bros/DAB/Sandy
Written by£ºA. Benassi/D. Galli/M. Benassi
I wanna be your illusion be you illusion
To make you happy tonight
Enjoy this trip with me
I wanna be your emotion be your emotion
Why don't you turn off the light
Imagine how we could be living
Sometimes I wonder why
We have no limits
Everything we do is timed
To find out who we are
We won't stop playing
The special game of love
And we get together
The time is running
I'll be your dream that you'll remember over and over
If only you tried me
If only you touched me
I wanna be your illusion be you illusion
To make you happy tonight
Enjoy this trip with me
I wanna be your emotion be your emotion
Why don't you turn off the light
Imagine how we could be living
I wanna be your illusion be your illusion
I wanna be your illusion be your illusion
I wanna be your illusion be your illusion
I wanna be your illusion be your illusion
I wanna be your illusion
