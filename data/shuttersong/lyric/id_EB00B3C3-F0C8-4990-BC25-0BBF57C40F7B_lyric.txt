(Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me)

Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care
At all
You've been out all night, I don't know where you been
You're slurring all your words
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care
At all
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care
At all
Oh, oh, oh
Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
Cause I don't fucking care
At all
You been out all night
I don't know where you been
You're slurring all your word
(slurring all your words)
Not making any sense
but I don't fucking care
At all
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care
At all
Oh, oh, oh
