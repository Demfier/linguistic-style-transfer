After The Fall - Kodaline\n People keep talking\n But I can't hear a word they say\n Life just keeps moving\n The world gets stranger everyday\n But now time is on your side\n That's what people will tell you\n But I got to let you go\n My head is saying that this is for the better\n I just want you to know\n I can't hold on forever\n When all I wanna do is to let go\n All I wanna do is to let go\n Silence are screaming\n But I can't hear a single sound\n And I'm feeling uneasy\n And I'm waiting away for a change to come around\n I get the feeling that this is for the better\n And I just want you to know\n I can't hold on forever\n When all i wanna do is to let go\n OhoOh\n Yea\n OhoOh\n Where does it go\n OhoOh\n I'll keep searching for an answer\n Or just peace of mind\n When your life has lost its meaning\n We all need a little time\n Are you searching for an answer\n Or just peace of mind\n When your life has lost its meaning\n We all need a little time\n End\n
