And who do you think you are?
Running around leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul

Don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?
You're gonna catch a cold

From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

And who do you think you are?
Running around leaving scars

Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul

Don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I've learned to live half alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?
Running around leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
