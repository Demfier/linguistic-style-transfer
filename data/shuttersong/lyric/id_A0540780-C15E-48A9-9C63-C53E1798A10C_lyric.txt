D-dem drummer, sicker than the swine flu
Don't really need medication
He got a tissue
And when he bang bang, don't need to boogie
But he might be sweeter than my, my favorite cookie
When he plays, he got a hold on me
In a race yeah, you got the winning streak
And ain't nobody got a drummer like mine
He can bang dem sticks, he can throw dem high

I got a thing for a drummers
How the beat shakes up my heart
I got a thing for drummers
So baby show off all them tricks and bang dem sticks
I got a thing for a drummers
How the beat shakes up my heart

You can feel it in the crowd
Come on bang dem sticks
I said I love it when it's loud

Cause you can feel it in the crowd

I don't think they're ready
It's ok

Triple it, triple it, all that shit
He looking so good when he bang dem sticks
He can do the paradiddle with a little of samba
And all the girls, I want your drummer's number
But wait a minute, what the -- is going on?
You're here to see M-Train because you love my songs
But there we go again with the double stroke
And I ain't talking dirty, I ain't making no jokes
Nah uh, nah uh, and he can play all night
Whatever gets you hype girls, whatever gets you high
Cause ain't nobody got a drummer like mine
He can bang dem sticks, he can throw dem high

C'mon!
