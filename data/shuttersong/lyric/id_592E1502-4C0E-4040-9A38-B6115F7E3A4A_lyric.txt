I could feel it, I could feel it, I could feel it
In the air around me
and
I could see it, I could see it, I could see it
Cause it all surrounds me
You got my love down
Love down baby
Got my love down
All I need is your Love
All I need is your Love
All I need is your Love
All I need is your Love

I could feel it, I could feel it, I could feel it
In the air around me
and
I could see it, I could see it, I could see it
Cause it all surrounds me
You got my love down
Love down baby
Got my love down
All I need is your Love
All I need is your Love
All I need is your Love
All I need is your Love\
