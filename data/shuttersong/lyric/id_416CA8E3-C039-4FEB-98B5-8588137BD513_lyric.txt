Look around,
Remember everything you have now but don´t forget everything you lost now and everything you need nowand everything you want now
Woah ohhh ohhh
Look around,
Remember everything we have now but don´t forgeteverything we lost nowand everything we need nowand everything we want now
Woaaoh yeah woahhh woah
As i look at myself in the mirror
Everything used to be so much clearer
How could we ever be the same?
Walking 'round like nobody´s business
How did i think i could live this way?
Who am i kidding?
And i wish i could build myself a time machine
And i´d go back to the night when i said those things
I would erase those words that i saidclear those memories from your head
And you´d forget what a fool i´ve been
That night and i´d make everything so right
The night i changed everything
You say apologize
But i don´t even recognize - what this is...
yeah
Oh boy, what am i?
A disgrace?
It looks like i´ve trashed this place - with my emotions...
And i wish i could build myself a time machine
And i´d go back to the night when i said those things
I would erase those words that i said
Clear those memories from your head
And you´d forget what a fool i´ve been
That night and i´d make everything so right
The night i changed everything
Ohhhhhhh!
Live like this forever - until there´s one mistake
It´s now or never
And we´ll live with a heartache of the one moment
It changed everything
And i wish i could build myself a time machine
And i´d go back to the night when i said those things
I would erase those words that i said
Clear those memories from your head
And you´d forget what a fool i´ve been
That night and i´d make everything so right
The night i changed everything
