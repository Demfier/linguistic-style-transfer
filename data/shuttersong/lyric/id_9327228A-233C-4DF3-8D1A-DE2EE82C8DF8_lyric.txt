Giv-giv-give love

 

Hold me tight, read my lips

Don¡¯t need a word to say

Lay me down, blow my mind

Let¡¯s take it all the way

 

Tell me will you love me tomorrow

Like you love me tonight ooh

So we can worry about it tomorrow

Just give me tonight

 

Love me till it hurts

Make my body burn

Love me till it hurts

I need my heart to burst

 

(..Yellow mother f*cking Claw..)

 

Want that real love, no fake love

That hard love until it hurts

That straight fire no fake fight

We can¡¯t stop until it hurts

Don¡¯t you worry about a thang

I¡¯ma do you right

I¡¯ma hit it in the morning

Like I do tonight

 

Slow it down till my heart

Is ready to explode

Explode,explode ,explode

Bring it back, go down low

As far as you can go

 

Tell me will you love me tomorrow

Like you love me tonight

So we can worry about it tomorrow

Just give me tonight

 

Love me till it hurts

Make my body burn

Love me till it hurts

I need my heart to burst
