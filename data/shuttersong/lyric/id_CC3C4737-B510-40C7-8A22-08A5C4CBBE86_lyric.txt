Yeah, Jake Miller, haha, uh uh
Growin' up I used to dream about the life
I mean literally, I dreamed about it every night
Man, what I would do just to live it for a day or two
Now it's same stage different view lookin' down at you
They say I rhyme tight now I'm in the lime light
Feelin' high as ever I'm livin' the Miller high life
So turn it loud I'm addicted to the crowd
They say the sky's the limit but my heads up in the clouds
I'm feelin' good now, you'll never break me
Maybe I'm dreamin, if I am don't wake me
I want it all cause I only got 1 life to live
And Imma get it cause theres nothing that I wouldn't give

Yeah, what I wouldn't give for the glory
What I wouldn't give for the flashing lights
What I wouldn't give for the stories
From a different city every night
We live, we love, I'll be a star, a star
We laugh, and lookin' back we've come so far, so far

I see my name in lights now, I'm livin' for right now
Makin' so much noise neighbors tellin' me to pipe down
Around globe different city every day
I'm packin' out arenas seems like it was yesterday
That I was buyin' tickets to my favorite shows
Always sittin' first row and when the curtains would close
I would sneak back stage just so I could feel the thrill
But it was a temporary high because I wanted it for real
But I'm feelin' good now, you'll never break me
Maybe I'm dreamin', if I am don't wake me
I want it all cause I only got 1 life to live
And Imma get it cause theres nothing that I wouldn't give

What I wouldn't give for the glory
What I wouldn't give for the flashing lights
What I wouldn't give for the stories
From a different city every night
We live, we love, I'll be a star, a star
We laugh, and lookin' back we've come so far, so far

Yeah, I was just a kid with a dream (with a dream)
Dying just to hear them scream (hear em' scream)
My name, my name, my name
Oh oh oh
Now I'm wakin' up every mornin' (every mornin')
Learnin' how to deal with the fortune (with the fortune)
And fame, and fame, and fame
Let's go!

What I wouldn't give for the glory
What I wouldn't give for the flashing lights
What I wouldn't give for the stories
From a different city every night
We live, we love, I'll be a star, a star
We laugh, and lookin' back we've come so far, so far

What I wouldn't give for the glory
What I wouldn't give for the flashing lights
What I wouldn't give for the stories
From a different city every night
We live, we love, I'll be a star, a star
