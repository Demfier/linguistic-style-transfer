18 - One Direction
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one  I know
Baby  I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved  to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along  I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink
Oh love  let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything 
We can live in love in slow motion  motion  motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you  oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
When we were 18
Oh lord  when we were 18
Kiss me where I lay down  my hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  oh
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18
