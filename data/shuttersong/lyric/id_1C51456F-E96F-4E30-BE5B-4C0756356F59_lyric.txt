 Come on to the light of day
We've got men and women that are deep at play
So I keep an eye  on  the shadow smile  to see what it has  to say
You and I both know, everything must go away, what do you say
Spent enough that is  on my heart
It's like a better luck than a touch  of dog
You got a sneak attack from  the zodiac
But I see your bright spark
Get  the pleas and go
Go my flow and go away, what do you say
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part  of my design and
Tell  the world that I am falling from  the sky
Dark necessities are part  of my design
Stumble down through  the parking lot
I've got no time for  the after thought
I like ice cream for an astronaut well that me looking for weed
Turn  the corner and find a world that's your command
Playing  the hand
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part  of my design and
Tell  the world that I am falling from  the sky
Dark necessities are part  of my design
Do you want this love  of mine
God compels  the Sol  to shine
Do you want it do you want it now
Do you want it all  the time
But darkness helps us all  to shine
Do you want it do you want it now
I pick your walk like a paperback
With a track Hammond  of a maniac
So I move it in and we unpack it's  the same as yesterday
Anyway we roll, everything must go away, what do you say
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part  of my design and
Tell  the world that I am falling from  the sky
Dark necessities are part  of my design
