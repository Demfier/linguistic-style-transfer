This is my word
This is my way
Show me a sign,
Sweep me away

This is my word
Heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there

Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word
Dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind!

All I believe,
Is it a dream
that comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope,
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
But all that I hope,
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

All that I've known,
buildings of stone
Fall to the ground,
without a sound
This is my word
Heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there

I'm starting to cave,
I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth
But I wanted the pain,
To disappear
Dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind!

All I believe,
Is it a dream
that comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope,
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
But all that I hope,
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

Believe...
I wanna believeâ€¦

All I believe,
Is it a dream
that comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope,
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I wanna believe oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
But all that I hope,
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
