When I'm with you girl I swear
I don't need anything,
Anything, oh no no no
(Yeah)
When you chill on the couch,
Ain't gotta go out,
That's fine with me,
Yeah, said that's fine with me
(Yeah)

You popped in a movie but
That didn't fool me (no)
We both know why you're here
Bad intentions in the air
So just breathe
(Just breathe)

Never thought I'd find this woman
But here you are in front of me
So I think we should get a move on
Got no time to waste
So let's cut to the chase

She plays the type of games
That make me want my cheat codes
(Cheat codes)
She knows even though all these girls
Hit my phone like free throws
(Free throws)
I don't need those, no, no
I don't need those
Head to toe,
You're so beautiful.
You're my girl so don't forget it.

Straight up, no questions girl you're the one that I want.
All I really know is that you're comin' across
Like just my type must've come from the gods
And I 'm up at the top.
Come join me
And nah, I don't really have a choice. See,
I know leavin' you
Is gonna make you feel blue like Boise
But right now me and you should just chill and enjoy
These moments and make them last
I'm makin' them lane switch fast
Quit livin' in the past.
Come live in the right now,
Turn the lights down.
Draw yourself a bath
So that we can relax.
Yeah, I like how
You make me feel
Like no one else exists
From chi town to the bay. The wheels
Don't stop, so hop on in
Come rock with this.
