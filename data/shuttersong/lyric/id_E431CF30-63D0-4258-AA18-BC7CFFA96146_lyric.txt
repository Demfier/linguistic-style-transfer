Of course I get lonely, I guess I ain't old me
I'm sick and I'm tired of getting used up tossed in the side
I hate this hotel room, four walls that stop me from getting to you
I'm hoping that someday we can runaway-way from it all

But I promise I'll be back soon
And a voice through a phone ain't the same, it's true
Give me time and I'll give you
Every drop of mine

Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
'Cause baby there's nothing that I want more
To hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something, I miss you more
And you never know when I'm coming home
(Home, home, home, home, home, home)
(Home, home, home, home)

(Home, home)
It's been 6 weeks
But how could I ever forget your face?
I find it so cute when you think

There's ever been anyone but you
I know I said I promise I'll be back soon
Just a couple more days we can get through
But give me time and I'll give you

Every drop of mine
Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
'Cause baby there's nothing that I want more
To hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something, I miss you more
And you never know when I'm coming home
(Home, home, home, home)
(Home, home) I'm coming home
(Home, home, home)
(Home, home, home) I'm coming home
(Home, home, home)
(Home, home, home) I'm coming home

(Home, home, home, home, home, home)
Oh tomorrow feels like a lifetime away
So why don't you stay right here?
Cause my arms were made for you to lie

Lie in, skin to my skin
Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
'Cause baby there's nothing that I want more
To hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something, I miss you more

And you never know...
Keep the car running and keep those sheets warm
'Cause baby there's nothing that I want more
To hold you right beside me the way I always do
But I gotta tell you something, I miss you more
And you never know when I'm coming home
(Home, home, home, home)
(Home, home) I'm coming home
(Home, home, home)
(Home, home, home) I'm coming home
(Home, home, home)
(Home, home, home) I'm coming home
(Home, home, home, home, home, home)
