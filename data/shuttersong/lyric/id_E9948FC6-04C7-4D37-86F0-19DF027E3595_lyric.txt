Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been goin' to work
Boss ain't workin' ya like this

He can't take care of you like this
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Got on my buttercream
silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

She's at a stove
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong
No, nothing wrong with a lie
Nothing wrong
With another short plane ride
Through the sky
You and I

Lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Love lost?
Love love
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost
