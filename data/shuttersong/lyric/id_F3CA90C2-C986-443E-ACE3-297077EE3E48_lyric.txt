Walking out to lose myself, eyes down low
Take my mind to somewhere else, where i'm all alone
But then you step outta the stone faced crowd like a wave's
Come crashing in, made the whirlpool spin, and you lift me out…

Magnetic Eyes…
There's no going back you've pulled me in to the night…
Magnetic Eyes…
Closer till our broken hearts collide…

Split apart by frozen miles of wind and rain
I can feel your desert heat pulling again
But then you step outta the stone faced crowd like a wave's
Come crashing in, made the whirlpool spin, n' you lift me out…

Magnetic Eyes…
There's no going back you've pulled me in to the night…
Magnetic Eyes…
Closer till our broken hearts collide…

Blue! You're so magnetic your army is a soldier
Like a force from out of this world you pull me closer
Barriers blown apart, you're still a world afar
I think i'm drowning in the pool of hearts
But then you step outta the stone faced crowd like a wave's
Come crashing in, made the whirlpool spin, n' you lift me out…
You lift me out…
You lift me out…
You lift me out!!!
You lift me out

Magnetic Eyes…
There's no going back you've pulled me in to the night…
Magnetic Eyes…
Closer till our broken hearts collide…
