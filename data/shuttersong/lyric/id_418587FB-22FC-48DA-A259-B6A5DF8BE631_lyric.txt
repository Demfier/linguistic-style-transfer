It's like he doesn't hear a word I say
His mind is somewhere far away
And I don't know how to get there
It's like all he wants is to chill out (She's way too serious)
He makes me want to pull all my hair out (She's always in a rush and interrupted)
Like he doesn't even care (Like she doesn't even care)
You, me
We're face to face but we don't see eye to eye
It's like fire and rain
You can drive me insane
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars
We're like different stars
But you're the harmony to every song I sing

And I wouldn't change a thing
She's always trying to save the day
Just want to let my music play
She's all or nothing but my feelings never change
Why, does he try to read my mind? (I try to read her mind)
It's like he tries to psychoanalyze (She tries to pick up a fight, to get attention)
That's what all of my friends say
You, me
We're face to face but we don't see eye to eye
It's like fire and rain

You can drive me insane

But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars
We're like different stars
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing
When I'm yes she's no
When I hold on he just let's go
We're perfectly imperfect
But I wouldn't change a thing, no
We're like fire and rain you can drive me insane
But I can't stay mad at you for anything

We're Venus and Mars
We're like different stars

But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars
We're like different stars
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a, wouldn't change a thing
