Oh, we can own the night

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

I know we’ll be alright

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

I’ll take you to the future

forget about the past

You can keep all of your secrets

I swear that I won’t ask

let go of all your troubles,

I don’t care where you’ve been

the only thing that matters now

is where the night will end

Them bright big lights are shining on us

That beat so tight it makes you wanna

get up get down like there’s no tomorrow

like there’s no tomorrow

like there’s no tomorrow

Oh, we can own the night

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing
别再烦恼别再不开怀
Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

I know we’ll be alright

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Oh, we can own the night

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Let’s get down to business

and show me what you got

just keep the record spinning

the music never stops

you wanna live forever

and reach above the stars

Let’s take it to next level

just light the space ship up

Them bright big lights are shining on us

That beat so tight it makes you wanna

get up get down like there’s no tomorrow

like there’s no tomorrow

like there’s no tomorrow

Oh, we can own the night

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

I know we’ll be alright

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing


Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Oh, we can own the night

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

On the rooftop

Surrounded by the stars and the views hot

Ain't nobody thinking 'bout what you got

Everything's ours, wanna dip? Get a new spot

Don't worry, don't worry

The night never ends, no hurry no hurry

Shorty look thick and the lines get blurry

And the nights in your palm so we might get dirty

DJ, let the beat play, make a heat wave, when you replay this

Tonight we gone party like its d-day

Young and free saying this the one on my CK shit

The Moon is the light

Sky is the ceiling

The low is the base and the high is the feeling

The world is the club, all in cause we can

This' one for the books don't worry bout a thang

Oh, we can own the night

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

I know we’ll be alright

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Oh, we can own the night

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing

Don’t worry ‘bout a thing
