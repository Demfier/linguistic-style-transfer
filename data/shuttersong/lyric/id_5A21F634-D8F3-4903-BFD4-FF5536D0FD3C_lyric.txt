BTR: Better with you
Better with you, yeah...

I try to write this down
The words just don't come out
It's hard to say how you feel
Been down the longest road
Said yes when I meant no
I lost control of the wheel

Cause you know that
Things get so bad
You've got my back
Make me wanna sing
And girl I'm singing about you

No sweeter sound
Than what I've found
No perfect love

Could be more perfect than us

Ooh baby it feels like, it feels like
The music sounds better with you baby
It feels right, it feels right
Everything's better with you

I used to think that love
Was something fools made up
Cause all I knew was heart break
Whoa I couldn't help myself
Let this heart go through hell
There only so much a heart can take

Cause you know that
Things get so bad
You've got my back
Make me wanna sing
And girl I'm singing about you

No sweeter sound
Than what I've found
No perfect love

Could be more perfect than us

Ooh baby it feels like, it feels like
The music sounds better with you baby
It feels right, it feels right
Everything's better with you

Every song
Every rhyme
Every word (music sounds better with you)
Everyday (Everyday)
All of the time (All of the time)
Every way
Music sounds better with you.

Mann: She's my music enhancer
When the music plays, she's my dancer
When I'm around her everything's faster
Every question I have, she's the answer
I'm head over heels
Can't explain it, it's so surreal
When I'm around you, baby, you make me feel like
BTR: Everything's better with you, oh, baby
It feels like, it feels like
The music sounds better with you, baby
It feels right, it feels right
Everything's better with you, oh, baby
It feels like, it feels like
The music sounds better with you, baby
It feels right it feels right
Everything's better with you
Music sounds better with you
