Try so hard to get away
Think about you every day
Try so hard to live without
But no, no must
Sun shine is shining far away
Birds eyes just looking out
And they can see that you're, you're mine

‘Cause when we're together, your love is controlling my brain
Like plunging inside of that fire heart i contain

Our love is like a heatwave
It's burning through the evening rain
Set sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave

‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
I never will walk away
Unless you're right by my side
Burn gas in the Chevrolet
She's so hot
And our connection's like Wi-Fi
Just love how you ricochet

Won't stop 'til you're satisfied
‘Cause when we're together, your love is controlling my brain

Like plunging inside of that fire heart i contain
Our love is like a heatwave
It's burning through the evening rain
Set sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave

Heatwave
Heatwave
Heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
Our love is like a heatwave
It's burning through the evening rain
Set sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
Heatwave
Heatwave
heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
