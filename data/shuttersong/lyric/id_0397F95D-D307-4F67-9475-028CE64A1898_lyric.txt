[Chorus:]
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

[Verse 1:]
All this love that I am giving
Can it ever be enough
Let's go back to the beginning
Will it be the end of us

[Pre-Chorus:]
Give me a sign,
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

[Chorus:]
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

[Verse 2:]
Cheating hearts, lying eyes, broken promises
I heard them all, but they never hurt like this
I'm in the dark when we're apart
And I miss the way you look right through me
No one else can move me

[Pre-Chorus:]
Give me a sign
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

[Chorus:]
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

Oh baby
I, I,
I, I,
Oh baby

[Chorus:]
I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Give me a sign,
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

[Chorus:]
I know
I know
I know
I know
I never knew what I could feel
I will be there for you

[Chorus:]
I know
We got each other baby
I know
We got each other baby
I know
We got each other baby
I know
I will be there for you
