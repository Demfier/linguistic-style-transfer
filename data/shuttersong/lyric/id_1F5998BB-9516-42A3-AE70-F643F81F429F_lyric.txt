Now back it up
Push your booty out
Move it in, move it out
Now wind it up
While I grind it up
Like a twenty sack
And roll it out

You can go anywhere in the world
And you know that they know about me
I don't think you really wanna ask your girl
If she knows anything about me

Nah, nah, you don't
Word of advice: want a happy life?
Don't look for what you don't want to find
But before your boyfriend finds out
Back it up one more time, dale
