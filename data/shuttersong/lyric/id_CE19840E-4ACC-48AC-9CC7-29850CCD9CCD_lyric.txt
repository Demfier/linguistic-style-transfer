You got a cold cold heart
You got a cold cold heart
Girl you're freezing my lips
With your voodoo magic kisses
You got a cold cold heart
Won't you free me

You got a cold cold soul
You got a cold cold soul
Thought you were my little angel
At least I thought you could keep me warm
But you got a cold cold soul honey
Won't you free me

Oh baby you got a heart so cold baby
You're freezing my summer days
And you're just way to cold for me
I need your burning rays

You got a cold cold heart
You got a cold cold heart
Girl you're freezing my lips, my lips
With your voodoo magic kisses
You got a cold cold heart
Won't you free me

Oh wont you free me baby
Oh wont you free me baby
Oh wont you free me baby
You gotta free my soul
Your love is taking a toll on me

I'll let you win this war baby
If that's what you want but free me darling
Seems like you're wanting more
When you know you had it all
Now don't you try to steal what can't be bought â€˜cause

I wanted to build my whole world around you
But I can't let you make my heart blue
I wanted to build my whole world around you
But I can't let you make my heart blue
(repeated)
I wanted to love you
I wanted to love you
I wanted to love baby
Won't you hear me?
