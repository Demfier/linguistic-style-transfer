Have you ever been to Mexico?
I wanna leave right now
Not a soul has to know the why or how
I wanna feel the tequila sun shining on my face.
I wanna see that bikini tan as we stay up late

Let's be birds (ooh)
Where you wanna go just say the word
Let's be birds (ooh)
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds (up), let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?
Come fly with me

I wanna taste the cinnamon in Istanbul
Sit on top of the Eiffel Tower that would be
so cool
Let's go to Tokyo its on our way to Singapore To wind up drinking hot chocolate on

a Soho floor
Let's be birds (ooh)
Where you wanna go just say the word
Let's be birds (ooh)
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds (ooh), let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?

Come fly with me
There's a whole universe that's waiting
out there
What's the point of wings if you never go anywhere
I never wanna look at you and think of where we could have gone
And all that we should have done

So put your hands up
Let's be birds (ooh)
Where you wanna go just say the word
Let's be birds (ooh)
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds (ooh), let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?

Come fly with me
Let's be birds (ooh)
Where you wanna go just say the word
Let's be birds (ooh)
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds (ooh), let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?
Come fly with me
