Stop
Starting to think that you're all talk
We both know why you're here and what you're waiting for
Tonight (yeah)

Wait
It's getting kinda late and you should stay
You're nervous I can tell by looking in your eyes

It's alright
We talk about it, don't talk about it, no talk about it, no more
Let's be about it, we'll get it poppin, girl get it started, let's go
And I'll give you whatever you like

Say my name
Ain't no time to play
It's not a game
I feel some type of way
I don't want nobody's body baby if it's not ur body on mine

Watcha say
Ain't no time to waste
Another day
I can never wait

Cos the time is right
There's nothing like when your body is right next to mine
Say my name tonight

Baby cut the lights down low
And I'm gon'treat you like you never felt before tonight
Breathe
Baby girl I know you got your needs
And I'll make it my mission to make sure you're pleased
It's on me

We talk about it, don't talk about it, no talk about it, no more
Let's be about it, we'll get it poppin, girl get it started, let's go
And I'll give you whatever you like

Say my name
Ain't no time to play
It's not a game
I feel some type of way
I don't want nobody's body baby if it's not ur body on mine

Watcha say
Ain't no time to waste
Another day
I can never wait

Cos the time is right
There's nothing like when your body is right next to mine
Say my name tonight
Let me hear you say (just say my name)

Hands wrapped round your waist (were face to face)
Won't let this moment fade (won't let it fade)
Just say my name
I won't let it go (Won't let it go)
Let me take control (It's not a race no)
I'm gon' love you so (I love you baby) (say my name)

Say my name
Ain't no time to play
It's not a game
I feel some type of way
I don't want nobody's body baby if it's not ur body on mine
Watcha say
Ain't no time to waste
