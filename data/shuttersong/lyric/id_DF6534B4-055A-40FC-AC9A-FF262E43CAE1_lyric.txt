You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down

Down
Before you meet me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February

You'll be my valentine
Valentine

Let's go all
The way tonight

No regrets
Just love
We can dance
Until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me

Feel like I'm living a
Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me

Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali

And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a floor out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece

I'm complete

Let's go all
The way tonight
No regrets
Just love
We can dance
Until we die

You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep

Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops

When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe

This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I might get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I might get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
