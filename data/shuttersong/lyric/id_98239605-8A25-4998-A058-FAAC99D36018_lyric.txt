I know I won't stop if you give me the keys我不会停止直到你敞开心扉
Cos' I can drive it like a criminal因为我就是那么天真任性
I won't watch if you want to leave你若想离去我无需伤悲
Cos' I keep looking back for a miracle因为我不停回想奇迹的发生
I'm just a lighter without a spark我是根干柴，只需一团烈火
Take a bullet right straight through the heart我是颗子弹，只想直入心扉
Oh, I've made my mistakes虽我曾让你心碎
But I won't let you walk away但我不会任你远走高飞
Please don't tell me you're gone请别说你已离去
Cos' baby, I want this亲爱的，我渴望爱情的珍贵
Please don't give it too long to this请别让等待乏味
Cos' baby, I got this亲爱的，我可以做到完美
Please don't tell me you're gone请别说你已离去
Cos' baby, I want this亲爱的，我渴望爱情的珍贵
Please, cos' I won't let you walk away我不会任你远走高飞
I got my windows down, getting lost in the breeze我举手推窗在微风中沉醉
And I feel like I'm caught in a fairy tale仿佛置身童话故事中
I can't stop wanting you next to me我无法停止幻想你我天生一对
Cos' I keep holding up for a miracle因为我牢牢把握着最后的奇迹
I'm just a lighter without a spark我是根干柴，只需一团烈火
Take a bullet right straight through the heart我是颗子弹，只想直入心扉
Oh, I've made my mistakes虽我曾让你心碎
But I won't let you walk away但我不会任你远走高飞
I won't let you walk away我不会任你远走高飞
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh哦...
I won't let tou walk away我不会任你远走高飞
I won't let you walk away我不会任你远走高飞
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh哦...
I won't let tou walk away我不会再任你远走高飞
