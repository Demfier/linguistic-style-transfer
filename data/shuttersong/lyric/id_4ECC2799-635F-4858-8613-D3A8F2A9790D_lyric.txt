Hey you
Can I learn your flavour?
It's brand new
Now it's in the papers
All I seem to see
Must be something underneath

Take two
I'm still tryna figure out what makes you,
hot on the callI
guess it comes from your heart
cause when your head's right,
you take your time
There's something about the love for things you like

Hey Trendsetter
See your fire when the strobe hits you
I didn't see who you came with
Bet you're looking for something new
Whoa oh oh
I feel the heat with you starring half across the room
I dare you play your cards boy, you bet I'm a trendsetter too

Bulletproof
on another level
Ahead of the crew
Select never settles
It only gets better the more you see
Powerful and free
Confidence is key
So watch me Figure it out!
It's all about what you bring to the crowd
Where your preferences loud
mmm they're calling me over
Set your fire on me
Like what I see, you getting closer

Hey Trendsetter
See your fire when the strobe hits you
I didn't see who you came with
Bet you're looking for something new
Whoa oh oh
I feel the heat with you starring half across the room
I dare you play your cards boy, you bet I'm a trendsetter too

BRIDGE
I feel the heat-I feel the heat with you staring half across the room
Trendsetter
Trendsetter,
double your odds
They grind away from the beat
I dance right into their hearts
Lasers on, got that energy
Can you feel the want?
It's you that I want now
Wait and see how they're drawn

Hey Trendsetter
