There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say
But you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do
But you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love  love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love  love
Love is all you need
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't
Where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love  love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love  love
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
All You Need Is Love - ”∞ ”‘≠…˘
