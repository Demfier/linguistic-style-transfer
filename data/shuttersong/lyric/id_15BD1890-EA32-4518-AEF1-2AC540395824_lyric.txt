Best friends you are my fucking best friends
Yo honestly this is the best night ever
And this song I'm really feeling this song
Yo honestly the fucking best night ever
This is the best night ever
The fucking best night ever
I can't remember all the shit that we said last night last night
We probably won't remember what we did last night last night
I'd rather be right here tonight with you
Than with anybody else in the world
I'd rather be right here tonight with you
Than with anybody else in the world
Best friends you are my fucking best friends
Yo honestly this is the best night ever
And this song I'm really feeling this song
Yo honestly the fucking best night ever
Best friends you are my fucking best friends
Yo honestly this is the best night ever
And this song I'm really feeling this song
Yo honestly the fucking best night ever
I can't remember all the shit that we said last night last night
We probably won't remember what we did
But one thing I'll never forget
I'd rather be right here tonight with you
Than with anybody else in the world
I'd rather be right here tonight with you
Than with anybody else in the world the world
Best friends you are my fucking best friends
Yo honestly this is the best night ever
And this song I'm really feeling this song
Yo honestly the fucking best night ever
Uh are we gonna get sued for this
Best friends you are my best friends
You are my best friends
You are my best friends
You are my best best best best best best best best best best friends
You are my fucking best friends
Best friends you are my fucking best friends
Yo honestly this is the best night ever
And this song I'm really feeling this song
Yo honestly the fucking best night ever
The fucking best night ever
The fucking best night ever
