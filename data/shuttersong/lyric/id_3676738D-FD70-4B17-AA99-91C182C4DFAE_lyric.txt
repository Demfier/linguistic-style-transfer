Oh Oh Oh
You're gonna love this
Oh Oh Oh
You can't touch this
Oh Oh Oh
Cause I'm a bad ...

We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumpin', make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Love this ... tonight)

Love me under the flashing light

Make me blow up this house tonight

(Beat break)
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
... I'm Madonna
(... ... I'm Madonna)
(... ... I'm Madonna)
We're jumping in the pool
And swimming with our clothes on

I brought a pee-wee to my show and got my freak on
The neighbors ... and says he's gonna call the Five-O

If that's your weapon we gon' give a good show

I just wanna have fun tonight
Love me under the flashing light

Make me blow up this house tonight

(Beat break)
Ah...
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
... I'm Madonna
(... I'm Madonn)
(... I'm Madonna)
(... I'm Madonna)
(... I'm Madonna)

(... I'm Madonna)
(... I'm Madonna)
Who do you think you are?
You gonna treat this love this time
Ooh, oh, oh ooh
Who do you think you are

Hold up with my nose up
And that rose up in that
I'm froze up, but my stove up
Cause he eatin' like this his dinner
I run ..., I don't fall back
Cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got em all struck
I'm the winner
Beep beep, ... move

'Fore I bang bang with that uzk
That's miu miu on my shoes
Ain't got a thing left for me to prove
It's that bottle service all night
It's that poppin' urban just right
It's that go hard or go home zone
... I'm Madonna, these ... know

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long

We get freaky if you want
... I'm Madonna
Oh Oh Oh
We do it like this
Oh Oh Oh
You're gonna love this
Oh Oh Oh
You can't touch this

Oh Oh Oh
Cause I'm a bad ...
Who do you think you are?
Cause I'm a bad ...
Who do you think you are?
Cause I'm a bad ...
Who do you think you are?
Cause I'm a bad ...
Who do you think you are?
Go hard or go home zone
... I'm Madonna, these ... know
