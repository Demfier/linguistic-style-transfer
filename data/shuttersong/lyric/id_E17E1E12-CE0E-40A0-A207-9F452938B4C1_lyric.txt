Hold up, wait, you used to be a frenemy
Back then boy, ya didn't even notice me
Why now, you trying to get a hold of me
We never even spoke so what makes you think you know me?
It's funny how the tables turn

I'm sitting back baby watching you burn
No regrets, it's a lesson learned
'Cause what you think ain't my concern
About time that I let you know

My ride and I assume control
You blew it baby years ago
Can't get with me, now I'm grown
Grown now, grown now

Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy you missed the boat
Can't get with me, now I'm grown
Your voice dropped, you thought that you could handle me

You played me, but now you trying to holla me
You're washed up and now I'm in a different league
Trying way too hard and I don't need your flattery
Now, it's funny how the tables turn

I'm sitting back baby watching you burn
No regrets it's a lesson learned
'Cause what you think ain't my concern
About time that I let you know

My ride and I assume control
You blew it baby years ago
Can't get with me, now I'm grown
Grown now, grown now

Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now

Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy you missed the boat
Can't get with me, now I'm grown
Hey!

You didn't want me it took too long
You didn't want me and now I'm gone
Oh what a shame baby now I'm grown
Grown now, grown now

Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy you missed the boat
Can't get with me, now I'm grown
Grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy you missed the boat
Can't get with me, now I'm grown
