You call me up
It's like a broken record
Saying that your heart hurts
That you'd never get over him
Getting over you
And you end up crying
And I end up lying
Cause I'm just a sucker
For anything that you do
And when the phone call finally ends
You say thanks for being a friend
I'm going in circles again and again
I dedicate this song to you
The one who never sees the truth
That I can take away your hurt
Heartbreak girl
Hold you tight straight
Through the daylight
I'm right here
When you gonna realize
That I'm your cure
Heartbreak girl
I bite my tongue
But I wanna scream out
You could be with me now
But I end up telling you
What you wanna hear
But you're not ready
And it's so frustrating
He treats you so bad
And I'm so good to you it's not fair
And when the phone call finally ends
You say I'll call you tomorrow at 10
And I'm stuck in the friend zone
Again and again
I dedicate this song to you
The one who never sees the truth
That I can take away your hurt
Heartbreak girl
Hold you tight straight
Through the daylight
I'm right here when you gonna realize
That I'm your cure
Heartbreak girl
I know someday its gonna happen
And you'll finally forget the day
You met him
Sometimes I'm so close to confession
I gotta get it through your head
That you belong with me instead
I dedicate this song to you
The one who never sees the truth
That I can take away your hurt
Heartbreak girl
Hold you tight straight
Through the daylight
I'm right here when you gonna realize
That I'm your cure
Heartbreak girl
I dedicate this song to you
The one who never sees the truth
That I can take away your hurt
Heartbreak girl
Hold you tight straight
Through the daylight
I'm right here when you gonna realize
That I'm your cure
Heartbreak girl
