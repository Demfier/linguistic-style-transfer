Wake up in the morning
I feel like I'm lost
Reach for my pack of cigarettes
But they're all gone
Who can I turn to when times get bad?
Who won't run away from me?
I've gone into a place
Where I'm drowning and can never feel free
What am I afraid of?
Would someone please just tell me?
I don't feel that healthy
What could you sell me?
I need something that's strong
'Til the pain is gone
Wouldn't that be lovely?
This could get ugly

She said love is for the birds
Love is for the birds
Love is for the birds
Love is for the birds
Birds
Birds
Birds
Love is for the birds

She came in, came out
Bang in, bang out
My only love used to trim bud in a gang house
Ran from a foster home she felt weird in the family
So she hit the road she my little orphan annie
Mom was violent
And dad was never seen
Tall dark and handsome she only seen him in her dreams
She didn't feel like the same love that me and you do
Smash the cell phone she don't need the fucking clue
She just needs some loot
She can hop on the bus
You probably feel the same there's a lot of us
A little hard and her luck all bottled up
I'm like the pied piper bitches you can follow us
We're on the same path, headin' nowhere quick
So stoned people lookin' like hello there miss
Yeah, but she in a whole 'nother hemisphere
I guess its always pretty birds that led us here

She said love is for the birds
Love is for the birds
Love is for the birds
Love is for the birds
Birds
Birds
Birds
Love is for the birds
