Loyal (feat  Lil Wayne & Fren) - Chris Brown
I wasn't born last night
I know this hoes ain't right
But you was blowning up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ring nor her ring on last night  oh
Nigga  that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart 
When she rather have a purse
Why give a bitch your inch 
When she rather have nine
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time  I'm the shit  oh
Nigga  that's that nerve
You all about her  and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch  no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me )
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah  yeah  let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up the bomb molly I'm a rockstar
She wanna do drugs  smoke weed  get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trapped
She wanna fuck all the rappers
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah  yeah  let me see
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch  let's get to it  right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl  that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no-no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah  yeah  let me see
Once the roc in the system 
Ain't no tell her will I fuck them  will I diss them
That's what they be yelling  I'm a pimp by blood
No relation  I don't chase some  I replay some
LVs  Hermes  Dolces
Them hoes  ain't loyal  they rotate
School me to the game  now I'm on a goody
Put it in the loader
She was riding in the hoot
Fuck that bitch
I got my own ho
Fuck your weed
I got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch  put her ring back on
Montana
Come on  come on  girl
Why you frontin' 
Baby show me something
When I call her  she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on  come on  girl
Why you frontin' 
Baby show me something
You just spent your ring on her
And it's all for nothing
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah  yeah  let me see
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah  yeah  let me see
Let me see let me see
Let me see let me see
