Here is my story, I got my type
Tattoos and skinny jeans, black boots and piercings
A public enemy

Not Cinderella, still got my shoes
I like the animal, the supernatural
Maybe I'm crazy but

If you were Dracula
Are you ready to take that bite
Hot and hazardous
Like playing with dynamite

Yeah I want Dracula
Forever be young and wild
Dark and dangerous
Yeah I love, I love the tragically beautiful

I am a night owl, I've come alive
I'll make the sun go down so I can see you out
Straight to the underground

I like the broken, imperfect rules
That's why you're wonderful, it's undeniable
I might be crazy but

If you were Dracula
Are you ready to take that bite
Hot and hazardous
Like playing with dynamite

Yeah I want Dracula
Forever be young and wild
Dark and dangerous
Yeah I love, I love the tragically beautiful

Only one kiss, only one
Only one kiss, you'll be k-k-k-k-killing me
Only one kiss, only one
Only one kiss, you'll be k-k-k-k-killing me
If you were Dracula
Are you ready to take that bite
Hot and hazardous
Like playing with dynamite
Yeah I want Dracula
Forever be young and wild
Dark and dangerous
Yeah I love, I love the tragically beautiful
