You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down,
You, you enchain me even when you're not around.
If there are boundaries I will try to knock them down,
I'm latchin' on babe, now I know what I have found.

I feel we're close enough,
Could I lock in your love?

Now I've got you in my space I won't let go of you,
Got you shackled in my embrace,
I'm latching on to you.

I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch,
Feel so enamoured hold me tight within your clutch.
How do you do it? Got me losing every breath.
Why did you kiss me? Made my heart beat out my chest.

I feel we're close enough,
Could I lock in your love?

Now I've got you in my space I won't let go of you,
Got you shackled in my embrace,
I'm latching on to you.

Now I've got you in my space I won't let go of you,
Got you shackled in my embrace,
I'm latching on to you,
I'm latching on to you,
I'm latching on to you,
I'm latching on to you.
