She said she want to stay together
I don't think I can ooh

Red light
You know I can't make this thing that official
Believe we had a great night
But I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit
You don't like that, I make this easy, leaving
After sexing on the floor
Baby, I know you need me like I need you
But I'm not the one you wanna love

So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You use to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love

No love
Don't come looking for love
No love

Shorty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down
Probably won't be around, nah baby
You should hit me when you tired of playing up in the house and ain't nobody around
You need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight
You got it girl, you got it girl
But you know I can't stay right? Nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?

So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You use to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love

No love
Don't come looking for love
No love

Until the morning we can freak but, baby girl, you gotta know, know, know
We can rumble in these sheets but after this you gotta go, go, go
Don't take it personal
When it feel so good we cannot get emotional
But that is when you find out that it hurts the most
Since then I've always been like \
