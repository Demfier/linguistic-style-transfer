You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me
Even when you're not around
If there are boundaries
I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe
Now I know what I have found
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love, baby
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

And I don't wanna let, don't wanna let go
No I don't wanna let, don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let, don't wanna let go
No I don't, don't wanna let go
