I don't know who you are
And I don't know where you've been
Always out on your own
Always down on your knees

Now you know
I need a miracle
A star-crossed lover
An arrow in my heart
I need a rainy day
and an endless summer
A pocket full of stars

Maybe you're just like me
You see the faces in the crowd
Looking down at their feet
Never once make a sound

Now you know
I need a miracle
A star-crossed lover
An arrow in my heart
I need a rainy day
and an endless summer
A pocket full of stars

...

I need a miracle
A star-crossed lover
An arrow in my heart
I need a rainy day
and an endless summer
A pocket full of stars
