The water is wide
I can't get over
Neither have I, the wings to fly

So, go one get me to a boat to carry both
My love and I
Must I be bound
And she go free?
Am I to love
While she don't love me?
Why should I act the childish part
And love a girl that breaks my heart?

There is a ship
Out on the sea
And loaded deep
As it can be
But not as deep
As love am I
Don't care if I
Should live or die

The water is wide
I can't get over
Neither have I, the wings to fly

So, go one get me to a boat to carry both
My love and I
To carry both
My love and I
