I'm sitting opposite you
On this table for two
You reach for your glass
And I reach for mine
You're drinking water, I'm drinking wine
I'm looking around the room
Avoiding eye contact with you
Where's the waiter
Where is this meal
My lips are moving, your lips are sealed
But the words that I spoke, they got stuck in my throat
As I started to choke, you just laughed and you joked
And people started to stare as I fell off my chair
And I'm gasping for air but you don't seem to care
Words don't come so easily
When you're in front of me
Cat, give me back my tongue please
Words don't come so easily
When you're in front of me
Cat, give me back my tongue please
I'm thinking as I eat
Biting cutlery and chipping my teeth
You've let in my lungs
Repenting my tongue
Cause on the brightside I've just written this song
But the words that I spoke, they got stuck in my throat
As I started to choke, you just laughed and you joked
People started to stare as I fell off my chair
And I'm gasping for air and you don't seem to care
Words don't come so easily
When you're in front of me
Cat, give me back my tongue please
Words don't come so easily
When you're in front of me
Cat, give me back my tongue please
Open mouth
Scream and shout, nothing out
Open mouth
Scream and shout, nothing out
Open mouth
Scream and shout, nothing out
Open mouth
Scream and shout, nothing out
Open mouth (Words don't come so easily)
Scream and shout, nothing out (When you're in front of me)
Open mouth (Cat give me back)
Scream and shout, nothing out (My tongue please)
Open mouth (Words don't come so easily)
Scream and shout, nothing out (When you're in front of me)
Open mouth (Cat give me back)
Scream and shout, nothing out (My tongue please)
Open mouth (Words don't come so easily)
Scream and shout, nothing out (When you're in front of me)
Open mouth (Cat give me back)
Scream and shout, nothing out (My tongue please)
