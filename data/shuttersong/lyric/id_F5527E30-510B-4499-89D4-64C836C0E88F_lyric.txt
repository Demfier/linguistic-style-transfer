I think that it's time,
That we find what we're looking for,
Told you,
Told you,
There in the light,
Come alive like we were before,
Warned you,
Warned you,
This is the start of something,
And I wanna be a part of something,
So high up in the sky,
But I feel like falling,
I think I must be dreaming,
'Cause we never looked so good,
Oh, we never looked so good,
I think I must be dreaming,
'Cause we never looked so good,
Open the sky,
Like an eye,
Searchin' for the sun,
Lights down,
We're found,
Edge of the good fortune,
We're shooting from the dark,
Hope that you hit no one,
Don't hit no one,
If you're sick and tired of fortune,
Go ahead and be the star of something,
Feet staying on the ground,
But you feel like fighting,
I think I must be dreaming,
'Cause we never looked so good,
Oh, we never looked so good,
I think I must be dreaming,
'Cause we never looked so good,
Yeah, this is the start of something, of something, of something,
And I wanna be part of something, of something, of something,
I really must be dreaming,
'Cause we never looked so good,
Oh, we never looked so good,
I think I must be dreaming,
'Cause we never looked so good,
I think I must be dreaming,
'Cause we never looked so good
