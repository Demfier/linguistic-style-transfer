Looking for my ever after
Don't wanna see my dreams get shattered
Everybody says I have to, got to, wait around just to be rescued
Not gonna sit alone in a tower
I'll show the world my princess power
I'm standing up and I am stronger
Listen to my heart 'cause it's getting louder
This feeling inside, is coming alive
No more waiting now
See the fire in our eyes
It's burning brighter
Let go of the fear and fly
Higher and higher
Rise up, the sky's the limit now
At Ever After High
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Power princess shining bright
You know we'll play the game
But we'll do it our own way
Don't wanna let it go down in flame
This is how we ride now, side by side now
They didn't think that we could, come out from behind the shadows
We're standing up, we're stronger
Listen to our hearts 'cause they're getting louder
This feeling inside, is coming alive
No more waiting now
See the fire in our eyes
It's burning brighter
Let go of the fear and fly
Higher and higher
Rise up, the sky's the limit now
At Ever After High
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Power princess shining bright
Millions of flashing lights
Hearts ready to take flight
This feeling's taking over
Can't hold it in no more
Don't ever wanna come down
My heart is soaring now
This fire's burning brighter
See the fire in our eyes
It's burning brighter
Let go of the fear and fly
Higher and higher
Rise up, the sky's the limit now
At Ever After High
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Power princess shining bright
See the fire in our eyes
It's burning brighter
Let go of the fear and fly
Higher and higher
Rise up, the sky's the limit now
At Ever After High
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Power princess shining bright
