You used to tell me that you loved me once
What happened what happened
Where is all of this coming from
What happened what happened
You say I'm crazy and there's nothing wrong
You're lying and you know I know
Baby what have we become
What happened
We used to never go to bed angry

But it's all we ever do lately
And you're turning away like you hate me do you hate me do you hate me oh
Yooou can take this heart
Heal it or break it all apart

Noooo this isn't fair
Love me or leave me here woooah oh oh oh oh oh
Love me or leave me here woooah oh oh oh oh oh
Love me or leave me here
Do you remember when you loved me once
What happened what happened

And you'd hold me here just because
What happened
We used to never go to bed angry
But it's all we ever do lately

You're turning away like you hate me
Do you hate me do you hate me oh
Yooou can take this heart
Heal it or break it all apart

Noooo this isn't fair

'Cause I could still be the only one you need the only one close enough to feel you breathe yeah I could still be that place where you run instead of the one that you're running from
