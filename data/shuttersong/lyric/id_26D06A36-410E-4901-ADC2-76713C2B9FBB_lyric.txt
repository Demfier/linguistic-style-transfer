I got a lot of things
I have to do
All these distractions
Our futures coming soon
We're being pulled
A hundred different directions
But whatever happens
I know I 've got you

You're on my mind
you're read my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright
When if we're miles apart
All I wanna do
Is be with you
Be with you

There's nothing we can do
I just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life
takes us
Nothing can break apart
You know it's true
I just wanna be with you

Yeah, yeah,
Just be with you
Ooh... yeah... yeah...

You know how life can be
It changes overnight
Its sunny then raining
but it's alright

A friend like you
Always makes it easy
I know that you get me every time

Through every up
Through every down

You know I'll always be around
Through anything
You can count on me!!

All I wanna do is be with you
There's nothing we can do
I just wanna be with you
Only you...
I JUST WANNA BE WITH YOU
