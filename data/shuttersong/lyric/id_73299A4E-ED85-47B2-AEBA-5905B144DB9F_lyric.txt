Don't want any millions
I'm gettin' my share
I've only got one shoe (just one)
That's all I can wear
A bundle of money
Won't make you feel gay
A sweet little honey
Is making me say
I'm sittin' on top of the world
Just rolling along
Just rolling along
And I'm quitting the blues of the world
I'm singing a song
Just singing a song
Glory hallelujah, I just phoned the parson
Hey, par, get ready to call
Just like humpty dumpty
I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along
Just rolling along
Some people have diamonds
and beautiful pearls
While others have children,
Just kiddies with curls
Keep all of your fortune
Keep all of your fame
I just found a sweetie
Who changes a name
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along
Just rolling along
And i'm quitting the blues of the world
I'm singing a song
Just singing a song
Glory hallelujah, I just phoned the parson
Hey, par, get ready to call
Just like little humpty dumpty
I'm going to fall
Because i'm sitting, sitting on top, of the world
Way on top
Rolling along
I'm rolling along
