Soul lover, which way have you moved?
It's been a while since our bodies grooved
Cosmic love, gave you something gold
So you wrap it all up and take it

Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now, somehow
Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now
You're all you have to give
The Aloha
The Aloha
The Aloha
The Aloha

The things you've found
You feel an little younger
and you begin to wonder
What is it you want to love
What is it you want to love

What is it you want to love
Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now, somehow
Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now
You're all you have to give
The Aloha
The Aloha
The Aloha

The Aloha

Ah ah Aloha ×8
You release
You give yourself away
To the rhythms of the world
Adored by the sun's rays
What's left to do, but to feel it all
You're alive now to die as dust
Nothing less as something more
Ah ah Aloha ×4
Something more.
Ah ah Aloha ×4
