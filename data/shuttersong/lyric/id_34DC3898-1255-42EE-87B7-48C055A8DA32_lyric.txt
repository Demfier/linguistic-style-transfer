I still hear your voice

When you sleep next to me.

I still feel your touch
in my dream.
Forgive me my weakness
But I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky
Can't you feel my heart beat so
I can't let you go
Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle
Your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I've cried
Oh good and the bad times
We've been through them all.
You make me rise when I fall.

'Cause everytime we touch

I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky
Can't you feel my heart beat slow
I can't let you go

Want you in my life.

Everytime we touch
I get this feeling
Everytime we kiss
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side.
Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky
Can't you feel my heart beat slow
I can't let you go
Want you in my life
