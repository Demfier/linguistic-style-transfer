At the table with the family,
Having dinner, blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker,
Then I took a look to see,

Then I hit him back thats right I had some food up on my fingers,
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,
I said cool, cool,
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger,
Before we work I gotta get this off,
See the other family members and drop gifts off,
Then I'm headed to the studio cause aint nothing stopping,

How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now,
Merry christmas, quanta, happy hanukkah!
Mary nodded

If you wanna get its the time of year
JB on the beat yeah yeah im on the stand
its crazy how some people say they dont care
when theres people on the street with no food its not fair
its about time for you to act merrily
its about time for you give to charity
barely to people dont wanna help at all
cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls
not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they can hold
so i think some of you need to act bold
can we get to a tribe let's change the globe (globe, globe...)
ima drummer boy so do, do
ima drummer boy so do, do
ima drummer boy so do, do
ima drummer boy so do, do
ima drummer boy so do, do
Yeah.
