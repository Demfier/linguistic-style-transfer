Little Things - One Direction\n Your hand fits in mine  like it¡¯s made just for me \n But bear this in mind it was meant to be \n And I¡¯m joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks \n And it all makes sense to me \n I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you you smile \n You've never loved your stomach or your thighs \n The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine \n But I'll love them endlessly \n I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth \n But if I do  it's you \n Oh it's you they add up to \n I'm in love with you  and all these little things \n You can't go to bed without a cup of tea \n Maybe that's the reason you talk in your sleep \n And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep \n Though it makes no sense to me \n I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape \n You never want to know how much you weigh \n You still have to squeeze into your jeans \n But you're perfect to me \n I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth \n But if it's true  it's you \n It's you they add up to \n I¡¯m in love with you  and all these little things \n You¡¯ll never love yourself half as much as I love you \n You¡¯ll never treat yourself right darling \n But I want you to \n If I let you know I¡¯m here for you \n Maybe you¡¯ll love yourself like I love you oh \n And I¡¯ve just let these little things slip out of my mouth \n Cause it¡¯s you  oh it¡¯s you  it¡¯s you they add up to \n And I¡¯m in love with you and all these little things \n I won¡¯t let these little things slip out of my mouth \n But if it¡¯s true  it¡¯s you \n It¡¯s you they add up to \n I¡¯m in love with you  and all these your things \n
