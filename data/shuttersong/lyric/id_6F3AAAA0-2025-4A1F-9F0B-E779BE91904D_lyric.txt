We got a love situation, (ohhhh ahhh)
You say you love me, (ohhhh ahhh)
But do you really love me, (ohhh ahhh)
Or how i make u feel, (ohhh ahh)
Another love situation
Has hurt me
Still I refuse to give up on loving
Though i've been called the fool
seasons change
helps with the game
after i give you my heart
how will i know you'll stay
i dont wanna be comfortable
too relaxed
so wont you gimme the facts
i dont wanna be lost here
in a trap
like the movies
thats a wrap

i really hope it last
are you here for a moment
like relationships past
Hey love situation (ohhh ahh)

We can grow together (ohhh ahh)
Spend the rest of our days (ohhh ahh)
Season change (ohhh ahh)
It helps with the game ohh woii (ohhh ahh)
After i give you my everything
how will i know you'll stay
I dont wanna be comfortable too relaxed
so wont you give me the facts
i dont wanna be lost here in a trap
like the movies thats a rap
ohh i wanna be comfortable or relaxed

i dont wanna be lost here in a trap
