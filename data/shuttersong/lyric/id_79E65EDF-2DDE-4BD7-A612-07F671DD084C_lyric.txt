Her skin is like satin
It looks as smooth than white
Her eyes like, black coffee
Are all I need tonight

She's wearing a long dress tonight
I don't know what's hiding inside
And they know they say that less is more
But I want to love her so

Amor, amor gitana
Amor gitana, amor gitana
Canto en Copacabana con mi quitara
Con mi quitara

Amor, amor gitana
Amor gitana, amor gitana
You know you make me wanna
You make me wanna, you make me wanna

Have you heard about this pretty girl
With a notice mind, how they call her
And so golden hair, like a fairy tale

Everyone is watching her tonight
I will try my luck, I won't be shy
If I get a dance, I will take my chance

She's wearing a long dress tonight
I don't know what's hiding inside
And they know they say that less is more
But I want to love her so

Amor, amor gitana
Amor gitana, amor gitana
Canto en Copacabana con mi quitara
Con mi quitara

Amor, amor gitana
Amor gitana, amor gitana
You know you make me wanna
You make me wanna, you make me wanna
Amor, amor gitana
Amor gitana, amor gitana
Canto en Copacabana con mi quitara
Con mi quitara
Amor, amor gitana
Amor gitana, amor gitana
You know you make me wanna
You make me wanna, you make me wanna
