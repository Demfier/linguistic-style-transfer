Ophelia - The Lumineers
Written byï¼šWesley Schultz/Jeremy Fraites
I-I when I was younger I-I should have known better
And I can't feel no remorse and you don't feel nothing back
I-I got a new girlfriend he feels like he's on top
I don't feel no remorse and you can't see past my blinders
Ophelia you've been on my mind girl since the flood
Ophelia heaven help a fool who falls in love
I-I got a little paycheck you got big plans and you gotta move
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small
Honey I love you that's all she wrote
Ophelia you've been on my mind girl like a drug
Ophelia heaven help a fool who falls in love
Ophelia you've been on my mind girl since the flood
Ophelia heaven help a fool who falls in love
Ophelia you've been on my mind girl like a drug
Ophelia heaven help a fool who falls in love
