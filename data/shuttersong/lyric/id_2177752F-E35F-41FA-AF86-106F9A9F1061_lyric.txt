Hey i'm glad i caught you on the phone
Thirty hours until i'm back home
Been hallucinating, me and sean
Time to turn his headlamp back on
Yeah, who you running from?
Someone left their haircut on the lawn
Twenty hours until i'm back home
Been commiserating, need sean
Think my face is getting long
Yeah, who you running from?

Sean!
Sean!
Sean!
Sean!

You've been waiting in the waves
waiting in the waves
Thirteen hours until i get home
Been Obliterated, need Sean
Getting good at getting gone
Yeah, who you running from?
Sean!
Sean!
Sean!
Sean!
