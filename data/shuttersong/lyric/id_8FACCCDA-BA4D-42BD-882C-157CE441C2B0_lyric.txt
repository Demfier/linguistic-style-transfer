Too many times they did me wrong,
but I know what I deserve
Too many times got strung along
but I know what I deserve
Now you walked my way, made me to smile
Made my day, made it worth my while
For once I swear, I know my words
I know you care, know what I deserve
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu

Too many time I've played the fool,
but I know what I deserve
Deep down it hurt and played it cool
but I know what I deserve
Too many times my love was blind,
but I know what I deserve
I never knew I could be kind
No, I know what I deserve

Now you walked my way, made me to smile
Made my day, made it worth my while
For once I swear, I know my words
I know you care, know what I deserve
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu

Say my name, say my name
I can hear you calling baby
Say the words, say the words
Can you feel me falling baby?!
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu
A lover like you-uuu

Oh, too many times I played the fool
I need a lover Like you
Like you
