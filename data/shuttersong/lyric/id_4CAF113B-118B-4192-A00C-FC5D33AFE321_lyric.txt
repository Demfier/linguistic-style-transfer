
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out

That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, and now I don't even care

Cause if me and my team in here's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac Blowin everywhere we going and now you know one when I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done

Soon as you thinkin you're down
Find out how to turn things around, nothing's looking up
From the ground up,
pound up,

this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up, and round up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin, fresh out of class filling
Like I'm on my own and I can probably own a building
Got..., no job, no children
Had the science project

Me and Mac kill it THC MAC DEV HD3

We gon' fight, we gon' roll Live our life
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun

Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
