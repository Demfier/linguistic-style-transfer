I'm missing you so much, I'll say you die tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know these times are hard and I feel this too
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you

And I'm wasting away, away from you
What have I gotten into this time around

I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to

You had me at hello.
I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, I feel more with everyday that goes by

I watch the clock to make my timing just right
Would it be okay?

Would it be okay if I took your breath away?

And I'm wasting away, away from you.
And I'm wasting away, away from you.
What have I gotten into this time around

I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello
You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, you had me at hello.
You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, you had me at hello.
You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, you had me at hello.
You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, you had me at hello.
You gave me butterflies at the mailbox, you had me at hello.
You gave me butterflies, you had me at hello.
What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello
You had me at hello
You had me at hello
