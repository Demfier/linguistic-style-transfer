She broke my heart, right from the start

This girl has taken me over, like a Jedi she's a mind controller
She gave me some now I need a little more yeah
She's the only one to make me scream and shout
I'm lights out, oooh I'm dead
Lights out like a bullet to the head
Lights out, look here girl if you let me in your bed
I'll be the only one to make you scream and shout

Lights out, hey!

Watch me, I'm lights out!

Yo, this girl's cray. One minute she love me the next she hates
She reminds me of Houdini the great, I think I got her on lock then she escapes
One hit got daddy wondering, stop the sugar, stop funding em
God damnit I'm in a conundrum, when I see that bu-bu-bu-bum-bum-bum
She knows I made her my number one, everywhere she goes I'm on the run
She got my nose on sprung
Lights out, hey!
Watch me, I'm lights out!
Work
Lights out, hey!
