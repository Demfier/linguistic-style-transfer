Kingston massive, we ready?
London massive, we ready?
Trinidad massive, we ready?
African massive, we ready!

I'mma blaze high till the day I die
Sweat the shit out, every tear, every lie
Hey! Anybody wanna dance with me?
Sipping on my rum in the corner still
We a groove to the morning break
Na we go banana in a suga shake
Bring the base up, make a blasta block!
Selecta gonna feed us with a well-cocked rock
Ting tangue swinging like a tingeling
I'm a twang my body till the problems gone
Drop baba juice, make it goddamn strong
See me rocking out, going tribal style
Dance like a chicken, flap tiger wild, ah
Flap tiger wild

Too original fi dem pawdie
Dem frighten all true dem saw mi

Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild

Dance like a chicken, flap tiger wild ah

Come come closer tell a secret boy
Dip you like a dumplin in a cup of soy
Man a crispy don't mean to be ruff
But I really can't stay naah, can't get enough
Puff puff puff, and I'm back to di heat
Loving it living 128 beat, hey!
Naah shake your meat
Enemy or friend is not an option, ah
We all the same when we go dancing stars
Hunt the reflection from a disco ball
Mayham rumble till I drop and fall
Pump up, bumble bee
Swetty, honey

Too original fi dem pawdie
Dem frighten all true dem saw mi

I just wanna shine
Just like di-diamonds ina di sky
And I really don't care
I love to watch the smoke dance in the air

Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild

I love to watch the smoke dance in the air
