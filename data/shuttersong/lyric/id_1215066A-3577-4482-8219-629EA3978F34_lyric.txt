I'm on a high tonight
I know everything will be alright
When people try to bring me down
I ain't worried, I'mma live my life

And every time you come around
I don't never wanna say goodbye
It's you and I against the world
Do what we want, there ain't no wasting time

No...
We're only young for the moment
So let's do what we do
I don't care where I'm going
Just as long as you come too

Rules are made for the breakin'
I wanna break all of them with you
If the world's for the taking
There ain't nothing we can't do
Cause the night is young and so are we
Don't wanna leave, we'll never say goodbye

You know we ready for a good time
Good times, good times, good times
Good times, good times, good times
You know we ready for a good time

So let the good times roll
Save all the memories on my phone
We're young and we're out of control
Cause we don't wanna go home

We're only young for the moment
So let's do what we do
I don't care where we're going
Just as long as you come too

Rules are made for the breaking
I wanna break all of them with you
If the world's for the taking
There ain't nothing we can't do
Cause the night is young and so are we
Don't wanna leave, we'll never say goodbye

You know we ready for a good time
Good times, good times, good times
Good times, good times, good times
You know we ready for a good time
Good times, good times, good times
Good times, good times, good times
You know we always have a good time

So let the good times roll
Save all the memories on my phone
We're young and we're out of control
Cause we don't wanna go

Rules are made for the breaking
I wanna break all of them with you
If the world's for the taking
There ain't nothing we can't do
Cause the night is young and so are we
Don't wanna leave, we'll never say goodbye
