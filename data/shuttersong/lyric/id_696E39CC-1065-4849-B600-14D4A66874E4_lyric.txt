Oh oh oh oh

Your mama she don't like me
Your brother wanna fight me
But you know you just wanna have fun
I'm not tryna to hurt you
Forget about your curfew
We gonna set this world on fire
We're stepping out tonight
Ain't got nothing to lose
We're gonna set this world on fire
You know we keep it jumping
When we break all the rules
We're gonna set this world on fire
Woah oh oh oh

Woah oh oh oh

If you're lonely
I could be the one that you call
Oh oh oh oh
'Cause by now you know me
I'll be right there whenever you want
Oh oh oh-woah
I know we gotta lay low
Sneaking out your window
But you know you just wanna have fun
We're gonna party all night
'Til we see the daylight
We gonna set this world on fire
We're stepping out tonight
Ain't got nothing to lose
We're gonna set this world on fire
You know we keep it jumping
When we break all the rules
We're gonna set this world on fire
