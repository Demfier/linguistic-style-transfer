Who cares for the life we've earned?
Someone's sold all the truth you yearned
Remember when we used to shine
And had no fear or sense of time
It creeps up on you

You can't cry now there's nothing to feel
No one's noticed our loneliness
Remember when you used to tease
And made us scream eternal time

I believed that you'd always be here 
'Cause once you promised a life with no fear 
Please don't break my ideals 
And say what thing was always real 
I was the one and only
Take me back again
