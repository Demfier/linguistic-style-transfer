I have to play this shit off
I wanted to make you my love
I knew from that day
that nothing he say could change my mind
I have to play this shit off
Officially you're not mine
I know that he knows 'bout everything
But nothing he say could ever change my mind
Change my mind
Put that on everything
Change my mind
Put that on everything
Nothing gonna change my mind

Is that you're not getting enough love
Cause it's taking everything for me not to come over
and tell you you're the one I want
Girl, I want your recognized fire
Baby, you got that sauce every nigga in here tryna get
You're what I want
But I'll let everybody around in here
iff I have to win your love
No more you don't have to put ten
Your can go and let me rescure you
My heart to it to the left as you walked in here
Not a damn thing he can do
But be clear, if we both leave here
you'r the first thing I'm gon' do

Time is money and money is time
She's standing right next to her man in disguise
She's looking at me at the corner off her eye
She's walking away from you, want a rewind
After they put her, they give her a ride
I beat her, she give me
breen call her defried

Pull up to the Mullar
Hop out with mi amigo
...
Looking for some damage
Found me a Kim Kardashian
I got it
Get it
Nobody can stop me 'cause I'm passionate
I wind up introduce myself
Told her - My name is Tego
Told her 'bout my magic act
Can pull up im my Leggo
Told me that she's not sick off her nigga
working for locker slipper
Gave her number told me pull up makes her grilzz come off

If I pull that weapon on you
Is it fine for me to come
Cause I've been told a couple off times that I'm a dime rude wind
You know you body original fire
Girl it got you in that cuf-cuffs
I'ma do my thing just to break that law

But I'll let everybody around in here if I have to win your love
