I can remember a time when I was so afraid
When even my shadow wouldn't follow me

So I, I, I'm picking up my sword
To shatter all the pieces that I was before
Cause I, I, I'm worth fighting for
For, for, for

So put me in a cage
Lock me in a room
Throw away the key
I
DARE
YOU
I'll break down the walls
A high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
oooh oooh

Throw away the key
I

DARE
YOU
oooh oooh
And I won't let you tear me down, no

I had an opinion, but I never spoke my mind
And I wouldn't argue, even when I knew I was right
But I, I, I'm not that girl anymore
Yeah, I lost the battle but I won the war
Cause I, I, I'm worth fighting for
For, for, for
So put me in a cage
Lock me in a room
Throw away the key
I

DARE
YOU
I'll break down the walls
A high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
oooh, oooh

Throw away the key
I
DARE
YOU
oooh, oooh
And I won't let you tear me down, no
I just kept on running, running, running
Trynna find out who I was
I would go the distance but it wasn't far enough
But now I'm standing straight and know exactly who I am
Yeah, yeah
I can remember a time when I was so afraid
So put me in a cage
Lock me in a room
Throw away the key
I
DARE
YOU
I'll break down the walls
A high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
oooh, oooh
Throw away the key
I
DARE
YOU
oooh, oooh
And I won't let you tear me down, no
