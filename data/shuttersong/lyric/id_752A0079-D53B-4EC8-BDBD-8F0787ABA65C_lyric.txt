I don't know why but my hands are shaking
I can see you coming and I stand waiting
Yeah I get tongue tied in the conversation
It's an eff'd up, F-Six situation

I tried to tie my heart down, board up all the windows
Oh but it's too late now
I let you get too close
I know I should take cover, hide inside these four walls
But baby I surrender, it all

‘Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger but I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground and I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker, but baby you're a force of nature

Oh...

I feel your lips move in and they take me under
You know just what to do that make me want you
And I know I'll be broken when it's over
Oh but I can't help but move closer

I tried to tie my heart down, board up all the windows
Oh but it's too late now
I let you get too close
‘Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger but I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground and I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker, but baby you're a force of nature

Oh...

I don't care if I survive
So crash into me one more time

Yeah...

‘Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger but I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground and I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker, but baby you're a force of nature

Oh...

But baby you're a force of nature

Oh

But baby you're a force of nature

Oh

But baby you're a force of nature
