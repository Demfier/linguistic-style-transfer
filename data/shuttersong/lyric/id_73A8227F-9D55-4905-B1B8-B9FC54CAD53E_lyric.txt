Let's go!

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them

And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you

This happened to you

This happened to you, so
It's just a problem that I'm faced with am I

Not the only one who hates to stand by
Complications ended first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences

I feel so useless in this
Can't back, stand back, can't ask
For me I can't believe
Part of me, won't agree

Cause I don't know if this for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if this for sure

Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Anymore, so

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
But what else are we supposed to do

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if this for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if this for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Anymore
Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose
Now that I find no way so bad
I don't think I knew what I had
Why do things that matter the most
