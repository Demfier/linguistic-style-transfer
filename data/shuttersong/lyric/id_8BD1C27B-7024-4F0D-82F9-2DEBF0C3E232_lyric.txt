When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me
Oho, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin'
Stand by me
Oho, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

And darlin', darlin'
Stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, stand by me
