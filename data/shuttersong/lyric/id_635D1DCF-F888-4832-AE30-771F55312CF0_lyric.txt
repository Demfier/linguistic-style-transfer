I was moving in the fast lane
Living life for the end game
But I just floated by
Oh, I was drifting away

I never saw the inside
Never more than a drive by
So hard to satisfy
Oh, I was drifting away

Your love just hit me from the blindside
Didn't see it coming it feels so right
My body's crashing into your high
Your love hit, your love hit
My blindside
My blindside

Now I never wanna come down
Never wanna have to live without
Your body next to mine
Oh yeah we're drifting away

Smoke is all around us
Such a beautiful chaos you say
Your lips are touching mine
And now we're drifting away
(Oh yeah we're drifting away x3)

Your love just hit me from the blindside
Didn't see it coming it feels so right
My body's crashing into your high
Your love hit, your love hit
My blindside
Oh, my blindside

And it couldn't be better
It couldn't be better, better, better
It couldn't be better
It couldn't be better
It couldn't be better
It couldn't be better, better, better
It couldn't be better

Your love just hit me from the blindside
Didn't see it coming it feels so right
My body's crashing into your high
Your love hit, your love hit
My blindside
(Your love hit, your love hit)
Oh, my blindside
(Your love hit, your love hit)
My blindside
(Your love hit, your love hit)
Oh, my blindside
(Your love hit, your love hit)
My blindside
(Your love hit, your love hit)
Oh, my blindside
