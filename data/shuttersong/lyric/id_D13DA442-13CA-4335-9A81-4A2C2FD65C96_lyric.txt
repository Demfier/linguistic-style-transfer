Do it, do it, do it, do it, gon drop wit it
Do a step wit it, put your hips wit it
All my ladies, let me see ya put a twist wit it

You can't do like me, I'm by myself
I do it so good, I don't need nobody else
What's happenin', what's up, got da purp fired up
What's happenin', what's up, got Patrone in my cup

Don't know how tha hell I'm gettin' home

Snap ya fingers, do ya step

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay
