I don't know why
I just feel I'm
Better off
Staying in the same room
I was born in
I look outside
See a whole world
Better off
Without me in it, trying to transform it
You are outta my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all this time, tryna get to me
But you are outta my mind
Yeah.
Listen, I know
This one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
It's okay though
Because it represents-- wait, better yet, it is
Who I feel I am, right now.
You are outta my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all this time, try'na get to me
But you are outta my mind
Heard you say
Not today
Tore the curtains down, windows open now
Make a sound
Heard your voice
There's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open now
Make a noise
Don't you test me, no
Just because I play the piano
Doesn't mean I
Am not willing to take you down
(I'm sorry.)
I'm, I'm outta my mind, oh
I'm not seeing things right, oh
I waste all this time, try'na run from you
But I'm, I'm outta my mind
Heard you say
Not today
Tore the curtains down, windows open now
Make a sound
Heard your voice
There's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open now
Make a noise
(Ooh, ooh, yeah, oh)
(Ooh, ooh)
You are outta my mind
You aren't seeing my side
You waste all this time, try'na get to me
But you are outta my mind
Heard you say
Not today
Tore the curtains down, windows open now
Make a sound
Heard your voice
There's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open now
Make a noise
(Ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba)
(Not today, not today, not today)
