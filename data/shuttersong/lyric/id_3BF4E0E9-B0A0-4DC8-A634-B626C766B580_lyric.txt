Well, you're a long walk from my street
And I'm dying in this summer heat
I hope like hell you're waiting, waiting

Everybody's living like they're crazy in love
I'm a dizzy mess and everything is so above me
From the floor I found a life I lead today

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week

They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If they'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach
(Showing off, showing off our teeth)

So make one last call back home
'Cause tonight we go it alone
And I hope that you know I'm waiting, waiting
(Summer, do you feel me?)

Everybody's singing like they're crazy in love
We made a dizzy mess of everything and it was enough
So bring all the boys and all the girls together

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week

They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If they'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach
(Showing off, showing off our teeth)

You're going out in style and I'm getting tired of
Summer, do you feel me? Listen, can you hear it?
(All your lying stop pretending, stop)
Cave in and believe me, open up and scream it

The answer's in the smile and I'm coming clean just
Summer, do you feel me? Listen, can you hear it?
(Give me something, stop pretending)
Cave in and believe me, open up and scream it

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week

They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If we'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach
(Showing off, showing off our teeth)
