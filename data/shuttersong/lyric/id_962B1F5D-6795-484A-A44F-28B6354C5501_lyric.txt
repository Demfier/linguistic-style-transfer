I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're around
I don't believe it and it slips on the ground
I want to take you to that place in mirage
But nobody leaves us any time any more
You asked me once, you fled, looking
It was dark
You made an offer for it and then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head

And all I hear is the last thing that you said:

Listen to your problems now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore (oh...)

And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda covered it up and threw it away
Now I thought about what I want to say
But I never really know where to go
So my dream is up to a friend
Cause I know what unlocks that door
And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda covered it up and threw it away
Now I thought about what I want to say

So my dream is up to a friend
¡ª Daft Punk

But I never really know where to go
So my dream is up to a friend
Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought you saw someone that looked just like me
I saw my memory that just never dies
We went too long and hard to give it more time

He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs the scissors up the seam in the wall

He cannot break it til the rose hear it fall

One thousand lonely stars
High in the cold
Take it, I don't want to sing any more

Listen to your problems now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore (oh...)

And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda covered it up and threw it away
Now I thought about what I want to say
But I never really know where to go
So my dream is up to a friend
Cause I know what unlocks that door
And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda covered it up and threw it away

Now I thought about what I want to say
But I never really know where to go
So my dream is up to a friend
Cause I know what unlocks that--
I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
Why throw float it around, that's all I do, when I'm with you.

And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda covered it up and threw it away
Now I thought about what I want to say
But I never really know where to go
So my dream is up to a friend
Cause I know what unlocks that door
