Cover my eyes
Cover my ears
Tell me these words are a lie
It can't be true
That I'm losing you
The sun cannot fall from the sky

Can you hear heaven cry
Tears of an angel
Tears of an angel

Tears of an angel
Tears of an angel
Stop every clock
Stars are in shock
The river won't run to the sea
I won't let you fly

I won't say goodbye
I won't let you slip away from me
Can you hear heaven cry
Tears of an angel
Tears of an angel

Tears of an angel
Tears of an angel
So hold on
Be strong

Everyday, hope will grow
I'm here, don't you fear
Little one, don't let go
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh

(Tears of an angel) Don't let go
(Tears of an angel) Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
(Tears of an angel) Don't let go
(Tears of an angel) Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
Cover my eyes
Cover my ears
Tell me these words are a lie
