I've been gone for. so long now
Chasing everything that's new.
I've forgotten how I got here
I've not forgotten you.
We were just children, with our eyes opened, and
You were all that I could see
You came close enough to know my heart-beat, but
Still not close enough for me.

Through the good times and the bad
You were the best I never had
The only chance I wish I had to take
There was no writing on the wall
No warning signs to follow
I know now, and I just can't forget
You're the best I never had.

In this motel
Well pass midnight
When I'm bluer than a bruise.
You come drifting in, through the half-light
In your funny yellow shoes.
I hope that's you standing, at my doorway;
That's the scratching of your key
And I hope this song I'm singing
Someday finds you
My letter to Elise.

Through the good times and the bad
You were the best I never had
The only chance I wish I had to take.
There was no writing on the wall
No warning signs to follow
I know now and I just can't forget
You're the best I never had

Nana-Nanana
Best I never had
Nana-Nanana
Best I never had.Mmmm
