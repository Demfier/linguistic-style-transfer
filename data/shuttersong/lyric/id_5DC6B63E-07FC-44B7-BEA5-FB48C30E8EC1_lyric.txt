Sons and Daughters - Allman Brown\n And I  will hold you tight  like the moon in the arms of the sky\n And I  will keep you warm  I will build a fire in this house\n And I'll build a fire  you fetch the water and I'll lay the table\n And in our hearts  we still pray for sons and daughters\n And all those evenings out in the garden  where we went\n These quiet hours turning to years\n And I  I'll wrap myself around your heart I'll be the walls of his heart\n And I  I'll keep light on  to call you back home\n And I'll build a fire  you fetch the water and I'll lay the table\n And in our hearts  we still pray for sons and daughters\n And all those evenings out in the garden  where we went\n These quiet hours turning to years\n And It's all to come for now we're still young\n Just building our kingdom but It's all to come\n And I'll build a fire  you fetch the water and I'll lay the table\n And in our hearts  we still pray for sons and daughters\n And all those evenings out in the garden  where we went\n These quiet hours turning to years\n It's all to come for now we're still young
