 So what we smoke weed
 We¡¯re just having fun
 We don¡¯t care who sees
 So  what  we go out
That¡¯s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, Uh huh
 So  what I keep ¡®em rolled up
Saggin¡¯ my pants not caring  what I show
Keep it real with my n-ggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean dont it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501¡äs jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong¡¯s fingers
And  smoke them hoes down ¡¯till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I¡¯m with you b-tch smokin¡¯ grade A
 So  what  we get drunk
 So  what  we  smoke weed
 We¡¯re just having fun
 We don¡¯t care who sees
 So  what  we go out
That¡¯s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yeah, uh you know  what?
It¡¯s like I¡¯m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin¡¯, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I¡¯m on the chase
Chevy, its gettin¡¯ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin¡¯ it
Dippin¡¯ away, time keep slippin¡¯ away
Zip in the safe, flippin¡¯ for pay
Tippin¡¯ like I¡¯m drippin¡¯ in paint
Up front four blunts, like ¡°Khalifa put the weed in a J¡±
 So  what  we get drunk
 So  what  we  smoke weed
 We¡¯re just having fun
 We don¡¯t care who sees
 So  what  we go out
That¡¯s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yea, roll one,  smoke one
When you live like this you¡¯re supposed to party
Roll one,  smoke one, and  we all just having fun
 So  we just, roll one,  smoke one
When you live like this you¡¯re supposed to party
Roll one,  smoke one, and  we all just having fun
 So  what  we get drunk
 So  what  we  smoke weed
 We¡¯re just having fun
 We don¡¯t care who sees
 So  what  we go out
That¡¯s how its supposed to be
