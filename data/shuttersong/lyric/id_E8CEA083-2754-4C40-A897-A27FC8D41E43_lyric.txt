California - Jack And Jack 
I can't stop, never let a hater 
Kill your dreams, 19, I got paper 
Katniss Everdeen 
Nah, it's always in my favor 
I pull up on the scene, black tee and a Blazer 
Won't chase a woman, I re-place 
I'll make you have deja vu when I walk by 
Like, "Hey it's that guy! Yeah aren't you from Vine?" 
Hell nah I'm from Nebraska, get your facts aligned 
But I ain't gonna lie, Jack and Jack 
Did blow up on the app but we're more than that 
Best duo in LA since Kobe-Shaq 
We need a whole demolition just to hold us back 
Run circles around the competition, culdesacs 
Legs keep burnin' but it's so worth it 
When you're young and earnin' money like a surgeon 
Yeah it's cool and all 
but spreadin' love's my purpose 
So who's gonna tell me I can't do 
Anything I put my mind to 
Now I ain't tryna hear it 
Bitch get up out my ear 
I'm just a midwest kid dreamin' California 
One way ticket cause I had to show yah 
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia 
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way, no way 
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way, no way 
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way 
I'm fresh up in the game and I'm here to stay 
Don't really got my shit together, 
just appear this way 
And I'm like everybody else, I got fears to face 
Nowadays even the real are just a realist phase 
And nobody's really what they seem 
Learned that the hard way, cuts run deep 
And these millions of people put their trust in me 
Man I got a lot of pressure but I must succeed 
So I'm a keep grindin' and workin', 
I'm finally certain 
My life is not meant to be wasted 
The line of success all these people be tracin' 
That shit, it ain't me, I'm a play my own way 
And I'm a little unorthodox, I can't lie 
No I ain't gonna conform I rock my own style 
Tell that to the fans and everybody by side 
Yo we're headed to the top 
and you should keep a close eye 
So who's gonna tell me I can't do 
Anything I put my mind to 
Now I ain't tryna hear it 
Bitch get up out my ear 
I'm just a midwest kid dreamin' California 
One way ticket cause I had to show yah 
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia 
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way, no way 
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way, no way 
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way 
Before I touched down, thought I had it all 
Now it's midnight sessions, playin' basketball 
My friends and my family, I'm a have to call 
And tell 'em I'm never goin' home, 
yeah I'm never goin' home 
No way 
Midwest kid dreamin' California 
One way ticket cause I had to show yah 
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia 
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way, no way 
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way, no way 
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home 
No way
