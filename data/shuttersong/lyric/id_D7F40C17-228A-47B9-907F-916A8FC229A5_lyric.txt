I ain't got time for you baby
Either you're mine
Or you're not
Make up your mind sweet baby
Right here right now's all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we going dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here right now's all we got

At least I miss trips around the world
Don't mean a thing
If I ain't your girl
A little party never killed nobody

So we going dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody

Right here right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we going dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody

Right here right now's all we got
All we got
All we got
All we got
All we got
All we got
All we got
All we got
All we got

Glad that you made it
Look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands
And the room's a bust
At the end of the night
Maybe you'll find love
Fake chit chat about the things they got
And my scout reputation keeping it hot girl
At the party of the year I'm a master plan
If you make me realize I'm your man
If the people get lost
Underneath the moonlight
Hectic topic paparazzi
Hold it while I take this pic
Speak easy
Rocking the feathers I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys
Cause believe me
I'm a beat mean
It don't mean a thing
If I give you my heart
If you tear it apart no
Uh uh ah oh
It don't mean a thing
If I ain't in your eyes
Probably ain't gonna fly no
Uh uh ah oh
It don't mean a thing
If I give you my heart
If you tear it apart no
Uh uh ah oh
It don't mean a thing
If I ain't in your eyes,
Probably ain't gonna fly no
Uh uh ah oh
Just one night's all we got
Just one night's all we got
Just one night's all we got
Just one night's all we got

What do you think You rock
Are you ready
A little party never killed nobody
So we going dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody

Right here right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody

So we going dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
