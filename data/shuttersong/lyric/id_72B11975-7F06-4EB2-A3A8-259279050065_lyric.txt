Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went fallin' out of key
So now you gotta find another
Now you're talkin' crazy, sayin' that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through though, watch me hit it solo
I'mma do it acapella, yeah
I'mma do it acapella, yeah

Once upon a time, I met the perfect guy
He had that Colgate smile, he had that suit and tie
Mama always said \
