What you wanna do baby?
Where you wanna go, go?
I'll take you to the moon baby
I'll take you to the floor, floor
I'll treat you like a real lady
No matter where you go, go
Just give me some time baby
'Cause you know.

Even when we're apart I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours
Till the night is ours
And I'm in bed with you.

This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just gettin' started
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just gettin' started
Five more hours we're just gettin' started.

How you wanna feel baby?
What you wanna know?
Just pour another drink baby
C'mon pour a little more
I'll treat you like a real lady
I'll keep you out the cold
I'll give you all my time baby
You know

Even when we're apart I know my heart is still there with you
Five more hours
Till the night is ours
And I'm in bed with you.

This is yeah
This right here is my type of party (oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Five more hours we're just gettin' started
This right here is my type of party
(You know this is my type of party)
Five more hours we're just gettin' started
Five more hours we're just gettin' started
Just gettin' started.

I follow the sound of your heart beat
How it always calls me
Finding my way back to you
I'm feelin' it more now then ever
I'll do this forever
Just to spend the night with you.
This is yeah
This right here is my type of party (oh yeah...)
Five more hours we're just gettin' started
This right here is my type of party
Five more hours we're just gettin' started
Five more hours we're just gettin' started.
