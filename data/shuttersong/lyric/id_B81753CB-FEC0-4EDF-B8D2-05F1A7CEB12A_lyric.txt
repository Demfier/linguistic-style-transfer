You said I was the only, with my lemon in your hand (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Exhibition is your habit - emotion second hand (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Had to pull away to save me - maybe next time around
And she said: Don't you wanna - don't you wanna cocai-cocai-cocaine?
Hadn't planned to - could not stand to try it, fry it (na na na na yeah)

Heard a cry for mercy in the city of the damned (uh-oh, baby, damn)
In the pits you go no lower - the next stop's underground (hello underground)
Your wine and roses ain't quite over - fate deals a losing hand
And I said: didn't mean to - did not mean to fail
You didn't plan it - you over-ran it

You wanna do it - you wanna do it when you wanna
You wanna do it - wanna do it - do it when you wanna

When you blow it, baby, you got to blow it right
Oh, if you fake it, mama; baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama, please fake it right (for yourself, baby)
When you f-f-f-fake it, baby, you're fakin' it for your life
For your life, for your life, for your life

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it when you wanna

Oh, I can have you, baby, But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothin' I could do

On the balance of the crystal - payin' through the nose
And when they couldn't resist you, I thought you'd go with the flow.
And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please.
Fold up your show

Hadn't planned to, Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it, I over-ran it, (fryin)
For your life, For your life.
