I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And when I leave this planet, I booked myself into souless island
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind

So here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
You're half the world away
You're half the world away

And when I leave this planet, you know I'd state but I can't just stand it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit
I find me a hole then I live in it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind

So here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway

You're half the world away
You're half the world away
You're half the world away

I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel dull
You're half the world away
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel dull
I don't feel dull
