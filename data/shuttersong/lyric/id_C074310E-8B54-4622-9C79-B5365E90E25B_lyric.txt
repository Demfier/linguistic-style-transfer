Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bob-tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
And oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
And oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Christmas Eve is here
And we go off to bed
As we climb the stairs
And nod our sleepy heads

We take our stockings off
Hang them in a row
Santa's comin' down the chimney
That for sure we know

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle, jingle, jingle all the way
I said, oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells
A-jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride and sing
In a sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
A-jingle all the way
And oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells
A-jingle all the way
I said, oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
In a one-horse open sleigh
In a one-horse open sleigh
