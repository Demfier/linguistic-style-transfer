Dear Darlin', please excuse my writing.
I can't stop my hands from shaking cause I'm cold and alone tonight.
I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.

And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet. We tried.
And if my words break through the wall

and meet you at your door
all I Could say is:
Girl, I mean them all

I understand why we split before a month.
Been thinking about the ball we dreamt.
Feeling like the sofa was sinking.

I was warm in the hope of your eyes.
So if my words break through the wall to meet you at your door
all I could say is:

Girl, I mean them all
