You wanna play, You wanna stay, You wanna have it all
You started messin' with my head until I hit the wall
Maybe I should've known
Maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door

Hey!

Said we we're done and met someone and brought it in my face
Cut to the part
She broke you're heart and then she ran away
I guess you should've known
I guess you should've known
That I would talk, I would talk...

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!

Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!

O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!

I can't believe
I ever stayed up writing songs about you
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you
Oh no, not anymore
Oh no, not anymore
You had your shot, had your shot
But you let go!

Now if we meet out on the street
I won't be running scared
I'll walk right up to you
And put one finger in the air
And make you understand
And make you understand
You had your chance, had your chance...

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!

Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!

O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!

Yeah!
Listen up!

Hey, hey
Never look back.
Dumb struct boy
Ego intact
Look boy!
Why you so mad?
Second guessin'
But you should've hit That.
Hey Demi!
You picked the wrong lova'
You shoulda picked that one
He's cuter than the other.
I just wanna laugh
Because you're tried to be a hipster
Kick em' to the curb
Take a polaroid picture

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!
O-oh O-oh O-oh
I really don't care!
