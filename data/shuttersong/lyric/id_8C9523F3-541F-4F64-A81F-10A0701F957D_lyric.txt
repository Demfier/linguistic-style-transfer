Stand face to face with the younger me
All of the mistakes
All of the heartbreak
Here's what I'd do differently

I'd love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair
Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones
Speak out for freedom
Find faith in the battle
Stand tall but above it all

Fix my eyes-eye-eyes
On you-oo-oo
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
On you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

I learned the lines and talked the talk

(everybody knows that, everybody knows that)
But the road less traveled is hard to walk
(everybody knows that, everybody knows)
It takes a soldier
Who knows his orders
To walk the walk I'm supposed to walk

And love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair

Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones
Speak out for freedom
Find faith in the battle
Stand tall but above it all

Fix my eyes-eye-eyes
on you-oo-oo
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
On you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

The things of Earth are dimming
In the light of Your glory and grace
I'll set my sights upon Heaven
I'm fixing my eyes on you-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
on you-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo
I'm fixing my eyes on you-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
on you-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo
I'm fixing my eyes

Love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair
Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones
Speak out for freedom
Find faith in the battle
Stand tall but above it all
Fix my eyes-eye-eyes
On you-oo-oo
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
On you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
I'll fix my eyes on you, on you
I'll fix my eyes on you, on you
