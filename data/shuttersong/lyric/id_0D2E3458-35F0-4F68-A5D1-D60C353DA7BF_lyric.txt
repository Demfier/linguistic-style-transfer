Hey
Escucha las palabras... de Romeo
You need this in your life
Ven aqui

I gotta give you instructions
You just gotta follow my lead
Your body's making sounds like percussion
I'm looking straight in your fantasies

And when you wake up
Feeling like a dream
You ain't gon' believe it
And everything you need
Girl, you gon' receive it tonight
And I know your condition
Imma make you feel alive
Relax and feel the ride

So act like it's the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left, and girl, it's for you, baby
The last grind, and girl, you won't find this feeling nowhere
You better hurry cuz the train is leaving

All aboard
Come on... Montate mami

I'm using words as persuasion
I don't got a reason to speak
It's always a special occasion
And it's on your layer with me

And we you wake up
Feeling like a dream
You ain't gon' believe it

And everything you need
Girl, you gon' receive it tonight
And I know your condition
Imma make you feel alive
Relax and feel the ride

So act like it's the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left, and girl, it's for you, baby
The last grind, and girl you won't find this feeling nowhere

You better hurry cuz the train is leaving

All aboard
Yeah, she wanna ride that Wayne train
So Imma bag her like baggage claim
We smoked that Mary not plain Jane
And everything is just fine
I keep a picture of us smiling at the back of my mind
I grab the backup
If I had, she throw it back like rewind
I put her face in the pillow
Taste it a little
Shawty said she feel like she's sitting on a missle
I said 5 4 3 2, the one can only be you
Shawty said oh lord i'm coming, I said me too
My love has no equal, get on top
And if you ride this train, get off at your stop

It's the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left, and girl, it's for you baby
The last grind, and girl, you won't find this feeling nowhere

You better hurry cuz the train is leaving

All aboard...
