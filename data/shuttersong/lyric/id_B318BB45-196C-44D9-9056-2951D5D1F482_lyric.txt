Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed

The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove
Us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out when I let you in

Stay
Hey, now you say you want it
But now it's just too late
Well could've been easy

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made

People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out when I let you in

Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
But now it's just too late
Well could've been easy

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
(Stay, stay, stay, stay)

Let me remind you this was what you wanted
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
You ended it
You were all I wanted
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
But not like this

Not like this
Not like this

Oh, all you had to do was stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out when I let you in

Stay
Hey, now you say you want it
But now it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out when I let you in

Stay
Hey, now you say you want it
But now it's just too late
Well could've been easy

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
