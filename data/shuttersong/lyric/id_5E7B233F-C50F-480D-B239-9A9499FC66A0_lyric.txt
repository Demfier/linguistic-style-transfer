In my wrestling and in my doubts
In my failures You won't walk out
Your great love will lead me through
You are the peace in my troubled sea, oh oh
You are the peace in my troubled sea

In the silence, You won't let go
In the questions, Your truth will hold
Your great love will lead me through
You are the peace in my troubled sea, oh oh
You are the peace in my troubled sea

My Lighthouse, my lighthouse
Shining in the darkness, I will follow You
My Lighthouse, my lighthouse (oh oh)
I will trust the promise,
You will carry me safe to shore (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Safe to shore (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Safe to shore (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Safe to shore

I won't fear what tomorrow brings
With each morning I'll rise and sing
My God's love will lead me through
You are the peace in my troubled sea, oh oh
You are the peace in my troubled sea, oh oh

You are my light
My Lighthouse, my lighthouse (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Shining in the darkness, I will follow You (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
My Lighthouse, my lighthouse (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I will trust the promise,
You will carry me safe to shore (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Safe to shore (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Safe to shore (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Safe to shore

Fire before us, You're the brightest
You will lead us through the storms

Fire before us, You're the brightest
You will lead us through the storms

Fire before us, You're the brightest
You will lead us through the storms

Fire before us, You're the brightest
You will lead us through the storms

My Lighthouse, my lighthouse (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Shining in the darkness, I will follow You (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

You will carry me safe to shore (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
