Was crying all night
I slept until noon
I just wanna lie in
My living room

I know in my heart
That you're not the one
So I'll just stay home
Watch VH1

My girlfriends know what to do
They know what to say, Oh
My girlfriends to the rescue
Come take me away

I'm on Vacation tonight
I'm gonna leave you behind
I'm on Vacation tonight
I'm gonna lose my mind
With someone New New
With someone New New
With someone

I sit in the front
Roll down the window
When our song comes on
The radio

I won't fall apart
I won't selfdestruct
No I'll just reach out
And turn it up

My girlfriends know what to do
They know what to say (Oh)
My girlfriends to the rescue
Come take me away (Come take me away)

I'm on Vacation tonight
I'm gonna leave you behind
I'm on Vacation tonight (tonight)
I'm gonna lose my mind (mind)
With someone New New (Yeah)
(With someone) With someone New New
With someone

Yeah
Lalalalala la
Girls lets go

My girlfriends know what to do
They know what to say (Oh)
My girlfriends to the rescue
Come take me away

I'm on Vacation tonight (Vacation tonight)
I'm gonna leave you behind (You behind)
I'm on Vacation tonight (tonight)
I'm gonna loose my mind (Oh lose my mind tonight)
I'm on Vacation tonight (Yeah Yeah)
I'm gonna leave you behind (You behind)
I'm on Vacation tonight (Tonight)
I'm gonna lose my mind
With someone New New (With someone) (Yeah)
With someone New New
With someone
New
