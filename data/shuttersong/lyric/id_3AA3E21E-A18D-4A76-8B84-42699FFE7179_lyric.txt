It all comes, down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You're gone now, and I missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much, to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

Gotta let you know, how I'm feeling
You own my heart, hes just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart oh boy

I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right
I'm not livin'
If you're not by my side
Ohhhhhhhhhh

I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right
I'm not livin'
If you're not by my side
Ohhhhhhhhhh

Let's meet at our favorite spot
You know the one, right around the block
From the nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Girls just sit down, Let's talk it out
One on one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, making ya love again
I need to be near you

Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, shes just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart oh girl

Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Pussy game so cold that he always seems to come back
Cause you know that it be a rap, When I ridin' it from back
Wait, Oh let me see your phone
Cause all them bitches is rachet
Wait, Oh let me gettin' my truck

Cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait, damn, there I go again

Man the shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant
