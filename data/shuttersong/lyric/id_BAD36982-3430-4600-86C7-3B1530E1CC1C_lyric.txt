(This is what you call real puppy love)

[Chorus (Cyrano & Dev)]
Baby I’m not usually a shy dude
And I know that we ain't in high school
No more
It’s just a little something that I wrote
(A love letter just a little love letter)
Saying hey girl I know you don’t know me
But maybe we could chill sometime
Drink a little wine
You’ll find
Everything you need is right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don’t know me
And I betcha get this all the time
But I can’t lie
Every time you leave I wanna press rewind
Say hey hey hey
I love you
(Chica chica chica)
Hey hey hey
I love you

See what I was really trying to say was well um

[Verse 1 (Shwayze)]
L-O-V-E is a four letter word
She got me looking for a better herb
Cause she getting highest
Higher than the clouds
On my flight to LA and I’m looking for the flyest
If love is a drug I just want to try it
One hit of her lips is like a coke diet
Can’t eat, can’t sleep
I can’t sign this what I feel so deep
And my heart beats for her
And she don’t want me
But all I need is time and time is money
And I’m a grown man just trying to be funny
But I guess this is about money
And cars, so I close my tab at the bar
So I close my tab at the bar
And just then she walked in
I had to to tell her

[Chorus (Cyrano & Dev)]
Baby I’m not usually a shy dude
And I know that we ain't in high school
No more
It’s just a little something that I wrote
(A love letter just a little love letter)
Saying hey girl I know you don’t know me
But maybe we could chill some time
Drink a little wine
You’ll find
Everything you need is right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don’t know me
And I betcha get this all the time
But I can’t lie
Every time you leave I wanna press rewind
Say hey hey hey
I love you
(Chica chica chica)
Hey hey hey
I love you

See what I was really trying to say was well um

[Verse 2 (Campa)]
She’s a saint I’m a sinner
She wanna drink wine, I got a vineyard
I’m straight but a little off centered
And it would mean the world if you wanted to enter
I let ya up inside my she could ride my (step)
Lady Gaga (oh) Shenana
I’m feeling good but I need her love
Cause when it all adds up
(Chica chica chica)
A plus
And that's real, I'll pay for the meal
But you can do dessert, I'm lookin at your shirt,
I'm lookin at your skirt, we don't need to flirt
Baby tell me the direction to pick you up from work
(Chica chica chica)
I’m just a regular guy
Who’s getting paid
Every single day, dancing in the rain
Bitch I’m on and I want you
I even wrote this song just to flaunt you
I love you

[Chorus]
Baby I’m not usually a shy dude
And I know that we ain't in high school
No more
It’s just a little something that I wrote
(A love letter just a little love letter)
Saying hey girl I know you don’t know me
But maybe we could chill some time
Drink a little wine
You’ll find
Everything you need is right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don’t know me
And I betcha get this all the time
But I can’t lie
Every time you leave I wanna press rewind
Say hey hey hey
I love you
(Chica chica chica)
Hey hey hey
I love you
Say hey hey hey
I love you
(Chica chica chica)
Hey hey hey
I love you
