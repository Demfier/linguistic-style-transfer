Lights around the tree
...
Mama's whistling
Takes me back again
Something about December
We're hanging mistletoe
...
And hoping that it snows
I close my eyes and then

I can still remember
...
How to get back home
...
Let all your memories

Hold you close

No matter where you are
...
You're not alone
Because the ones you love are never far

...
If christmas is in your heart

...
Who really needs a gift
...

When love is meant to give
I can still recall
Carry with me always

Every christmas dreams
...
They live in you and me
...

Let all your memories
Hold you close
No matter where you are
...
You're not alone
Because the ones you love are never far
...
If christmas is in your heart
...
Lights around the tree
...
Mama's whistling
Takes me back again
...
There's something about December
Let all your memories
Hold you close
No matter where you are
...
You're not alone
Because the ones you love are never far
...
If christmas is in your heart
