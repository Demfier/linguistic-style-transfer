Seven billion people
Seven billion hearts
Seven billion planets and seven billion stars
Seven billion ways to say i love you
Seven billion ways to hold you in my arms
Life is getting crazy and life is getting hard
I'm watching my back and keeping up my guard
But your smile lets me forget
Oh, your smile lets me forget
The sun is coming up now
Shout it in the skies
Floating up so high
There's seven billion smiles in the world
And yours is my favorite
Seven billion smiles in the world
Every night and every day
In the darkness, in the rain
Your smile takes my breath away
It takes my breath away
Oh, it takes my breath away
This is a feeling i've never felt before
And i don't think i've loved anybody more
I feel like a ship that's sailing in the shore
Heart is skipping beats and i feel it in my core
My heart's been broken seven billion times
Always got seven billion people in my mind
Oh, your smile lets me forget
Oh, your smile lets me forget it all again
The sun is coming up now
Shout it in the skies
Floating up so high
There's seven billion smiles in the world
And yours is my favorite
Seven billion smiles in the world
Oh, every night and every day
In the darkness, in the rain
Your smile takes my breath away
It takes my breath away
Oh, it takes my breath away
There's seven billion smiles in the world
And yours is my favorite
Seven billion smiles in the world
Oh, every night and every day
In the darkness, in the rain
Your smile takes my breath away
It takes my breath away
Oh, it takes my breath away
