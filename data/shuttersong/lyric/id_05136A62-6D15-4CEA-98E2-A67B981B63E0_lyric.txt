Whenever I was frightened, or ever felt alone
I turned to the night sky and a star I call my own
Somewhere I could run to, just across the Milky Way
If you like, I could take you, it's just a light-year and a day

We can sail away tonight, on a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars, bring us back home
In a place so far away, we'll be young, that's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command, when we find ourselves in never, Neverland

Through all my make-believe, there's some reality
In your reflection, there's much more than you see
All that you hope for, you hope for today
Is the love someone gives you, in an unconditional way

We can sail away tonight, on a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars to bring us back home
In a place so far away, we'll be young, that's how we'll stay
Every wish is a command, when we find ourselves in never, Neverland

Picture a land you never have seen, life is eternal and evergreen
Future of happiness all in your hands, all in this place I created, that I call

Neverland
We can sail away tonight, on a sea of pure moonlight
We can navigate the stars to bring us back home
In a place so far away, we'll be young, that's how we'll stay
And with your hand in my hand, I am closer now to finding Neverland
And with your hand in my hand, I am closer now to finding Neverland
Neverland
Neverland
