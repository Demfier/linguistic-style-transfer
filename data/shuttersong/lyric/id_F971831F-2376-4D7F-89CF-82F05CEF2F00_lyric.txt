It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on with the best of 'em

You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A sinful miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again, and I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat

Constantly
Girl, you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do

And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I've been hypnotized by your destiny
You're a miracle, lyrical, beautiful
You are, and I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat

No one compares
You stand alone
To every record I own
Music to my heart
That's what you are
It's a song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat
(repeat, repeat, repeat)
