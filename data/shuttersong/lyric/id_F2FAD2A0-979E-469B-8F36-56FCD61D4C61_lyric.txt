There is a house in New Orleans they call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy and God, I know I'm one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone, how long now?
Until the clouds unroll and you come down, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

I cried to my daddy on the telephone, how long now?
Until the clouds unroll and you come home, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply

New birth, rebirth, trombone Shorty
Living like birds in the magnolia trees
Child on a rooftop, mother on her knees
Her sign reads 'Please, I am an American'

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now?
Until the weather change condemns belief, how long now?
When the night watchman is in the fleet what's wrong now?

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
