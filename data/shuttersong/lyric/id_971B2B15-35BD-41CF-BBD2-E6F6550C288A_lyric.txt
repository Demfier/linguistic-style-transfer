Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and passed the guards
Just like she already owned it

I said can you give it back to me
She said never in your wildest dreams

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes¡­

Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist

Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

I said can I take you home with me
She said never in your wildest dreams

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes¡­

I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know
you'll remember me

I'll remember you
And I know, you know
I hope you remember how we danced
How we danced

How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
Danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes¡­

Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
