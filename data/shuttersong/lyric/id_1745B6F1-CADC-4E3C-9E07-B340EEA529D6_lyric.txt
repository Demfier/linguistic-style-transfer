Paradise (Never Change) - Jack & Jack\n Some people all about the dolla bill\n It's quite a shame that ain't really how you oughta feel\n It's all the same every day how you gotta deal\n With all the pain but in time it is gonna heal\n We never change for anybody that would just be insane\n Light a flame rock it back and forth let me take you away\n With my words\n I heard someone kicked it to the curb\n Keep your head held high like you're chiefin' on the herb\n It's absurd the way the dolla bill rules life\n Two types of people on this earth who's right\n One side's controlled by material things\n The others live for experience and everything it brings\n I'm the king of the latter sing about what matters\n At the ball park with my friends swing batta batta\n Just another summers day watch the sun fade away\n All I gotta say is we'll never change\n Get away from it all not a care in the world\n Watch the sun hit the water as the waves curl\n No plans but a drink in my hand\n No shoes no shirt swimsuit ray bans\n Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding\n Come on baby girl the water's fine just dive in\n Ain't a dream so open your eyes we're just living in paradise\n Oh oh whoa oh\n Swear we'll never change\n So come with me come with me\n Beach sides where we're gonna be\n Smiling and enjoying the world that we're living in\n Party on an island somewhere in the caribbean\n Somewhere tropical underneath the hot sun\n Not a worry in the world we ain't got one\n Shotgun another brew by the deep blue\n Never going home 'cause we really don't need to\n I'm feeling irie congo line right behind me\n We getting lively chillin' in hawaii\n Yeah taking shots like kyrie\n Take a couple more now you in my league\n Come vibe with me get high with me\n I know we don't know each other's names\n Where we wanna be blue skies and sea\n Yeah we'll never change\n Get away from it all not a care in the world\n Watch the sun hit the water as the waves curl\n No plans but a drink in my hand\n No shoes no shirt swimsuit ray bans\n Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding\n Come on baby girl the water's fine just dive in\n Ain't a dream so open your eyes we're just living in paradise\n We're never changing we'll stay the same and\n We'll never change at all\n We're never changing we'll stay the same and\n We'll never change at all\n Get away from it all not a care in the world\n Watch the sun hit the water as the waves curl\n No plans but a drink in my hand\n No shoes no shirt swimsuit ray bans\n Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding\n Come on baby girl the water's fine just dive in\n Ain't a dream so open your eyes we're just living in paradise\n Oh oh whoa oh\n Swear we'll never change\n Just me and you\n We're just living in paradise
