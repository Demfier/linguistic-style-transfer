Light don't stick to you
Like it used to do
Think you've lost your shine.

Wishing days away
Busy chasing trains
Leaving us behind.

Let's get a ticket for those tracks
Don't say a word and don't turn back
Let's get out of here
Let's get out of here
We can get lost between the rails
We've never been afraid to fail
Let's get out of here
Let's get out of here.

If you dig up your roots
Then I'll dig up my roots
And we can take them with us
Wherever we go
And all that we are
Is in the beat of our hearts
And I know we're ready
To dive into the unknown,
'Cause I'm caught in the middle
I'd rather break out on my own
Than be caught in the middle.

Sights set to the sky
Sick of standing by
Getting itchy feet.

Need some new places
Meet some fresh faces
No one left to please

Let's get a ticket for those tracks
Don't say a word and don't turn back
Let's get out of here
Let's get out of here
We can get lost between the rails
We've never been afraid to fail.

So, if you dig up your roots
Then I'll dig up my roots
And we can take them with us
Wherever we go
And all that we are
Is in the beat of our hearts
And I know we're ready
To dive into the unknown,
'Cause I'm caught in the middle
I'd rather break out on my own
Than be caught in the middle.

We're carrying our roots
In everything we do
You know there's nothing left here for us
We've got everything we need
It takes a leap to plant the seed
You know there's nothing left here for us.

So, if you dig up your roots
Then I'll dig up my roots
And we can take them with us
Wherever we go
And all that we are
Is in the beat of our hearts
And I know we're ready
Yes, I know we're ready.

So, If you dig up your roots
Then I'll dig up my roots
And we can take them with us
Wherever we go
And all that we are
Is in the beat of our hearts
And I know we're ready
To dive into the unknown,
'Cause I'm caught in the middle
I'd rather break out on my own
Than be caught in the middle
Than be caught in the middle.
