Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh oh

Yep!
Put the stereo on the roof and crank the JBLs
Give me something with a backbeat
With country in the rap beat
And twist it on up to 10
And if the neighbors disapprove
Well they can go to Helena, Montana

Or you can grab a case of beer and baby come on in
Well be spinnin near the streetlights
Lookin like a strobe light
Til were feelin alright

Gonna do it all night
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh oh
Monday's so far away
All my party people

Well come on
Yeah were gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot shots
Someone tell the clock clock
We aint gonna stop stop
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people

Oh lets go
Call your ten best lookin friends
Tell them to call ten more
I got enough yard for all yall to park
Just bring your own cup for the keg
Tell em look for the disco ball
Spinnin round on my porch
Well be poppin off tops in the hot tub truck bed
Make a few waves, thats enough said
Gonna get buck wild

Get a little buzz on
David Lee Roth style
Might as well jump jump
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh oh
Mondays so far away
All my party people
Oh lets go

Do a lotta shot shots
