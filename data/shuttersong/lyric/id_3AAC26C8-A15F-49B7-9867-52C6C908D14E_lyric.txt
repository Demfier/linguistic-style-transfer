How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally
It comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive
You don't have to try
It comes naturally
It comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
(Away, away, away)
What you do so naturally
(Naturally, naturally, naturally)

You are the thunder
And I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
Bay, bay, baby

You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally
(You know it does)
It comes naturally, yeah

And it takes my breath away
(Every time)
What you do so naturally

You are the thunder
And I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
Bay, bay, baby

When we collide, sparks fly
When you look in my eyes
It takes my breath away
(You are)

You are the thunder
And I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
Bay, bay, baby
Naturally, naturally
Bay, bay, baby
Naturally, naturally
Everything, baby, comes naturally
