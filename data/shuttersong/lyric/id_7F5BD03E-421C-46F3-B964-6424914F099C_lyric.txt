
When you walk into a crowded room
You're standing out
Cause you got it all professional
How you lay it down
Your confidence, like nothing else,
Can knock me out

You never fake it
You never ever fake it

¡®Bout you I wanna know everything
I can be your James Dean
So let me into that head of yours
Let me in

¡®Cause every king's gonna need a queen
You're lighting up like I've never seen
You know you're perfect, don't have to change
¡®Cause I would always stay, if you were my Beyonc¨¦

If you were my Beyonc¨¦
If you were my Beyonc¨¦

You know you're perfect, don't have to change
¡®Cause I would always stay, if you were my Beyonc¨¦

When numbers blow up on my phone
I'm freaking out, got me shivering
It's a crazy thing that I'm talking ¡®bout
A girl like you, with the things you do, can take the crown

Cause you're amazing
Yeah, you
Yeah, you're amazing
