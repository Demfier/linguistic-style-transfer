Walk on by - Aretha Franklin
If you see me walkin' down the streets
And I start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by
Walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
That let me grieve in private
'Cause each time I see you
I break down and cry
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
I just can't get over losin' you
And so if I seem so broken in pieces
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
Tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said good-bye
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
Walk on by
Now you know you gotta go so walk by
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
Now you know you gotta go so walk
Make believe you never see the tears I cry by
