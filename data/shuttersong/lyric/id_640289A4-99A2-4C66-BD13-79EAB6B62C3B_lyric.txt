I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town

I'm counting my sheep and each one that passes is another dream to ashes
and they all fall down.



And as I lay me down tonight,
I close my eyes, what a beautiful sight



Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so damn tired of having to live without you
And I, I don't mind at all
Sleeping to dream about you I'm so tired

Yes I am I am I am

I found myself in the riches (Your eyes, your lips, your hair) Well you were everywhere out there

But I woke up in the ditches. I hit the light and I thought you might be here
but you were nowhere. (Oh love but you were nowhere at all)
As I lay me back to sleep this love I pray that I can keep


Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so damn tired of having to live without you
But I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you I'm so tired



(Just a little a lullaby yes it's just a little lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night.)


Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so damn tired of having to live without you
But I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so tired
And I'm so tired
