Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
See my face in flashing sings
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old

Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so wrong

By doing the right thing
And I feel something so right
By doing the wrong thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately I been, I been losing sleep

Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars
I feel this love

And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four letter word
Make money or watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold

And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
By doing the right thing

And I feel something so right
By doing wrong thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
