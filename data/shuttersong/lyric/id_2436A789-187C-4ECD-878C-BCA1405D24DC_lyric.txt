Cotton wool fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drive
and a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup

Get the party, started
Girl you make my speakers go BOOM boe
Dancin' on the tailgate in the half moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue
jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be

The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
If you aint a 10 you're a 9.9

Tippin' n' spillin' that home made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Thrown little cherry bombs into my fire
Good god all mighty
Girl you make my speakers go Boom Boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon

That kinda thing makes a man go
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue
jeans

Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz i'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
So let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off all out in the water
Girl you make my speakers go Boom Boom
