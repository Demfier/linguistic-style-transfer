Back once again, sipping Hen' mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends counting Benjamin's
Spinners in, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Different things made a change of plans, well, that all depends

Shadows my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush motherfuck the police, all my nigga rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sipping on that codeine
We hustle hard, no sleep, your bitch loose, that's no leash

I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds 'cause that shit is a facade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second

See me in the hood, the gangsters saying, wassup?

Uh, uh, pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror, uh
Clothes getting weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga, pin your hair up, uh

The nerves with this dude
But I'm cool as a vent, 40 OZ full of blue

I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second
