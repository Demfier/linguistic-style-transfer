I'm on the edge got to get away
I've seen it all before
I'm going down like a renegade
And I'm still begging from more
This is the last time I tell you to open your eyes
The city is sleeping on the monsters outside
The fire is burning there's no way to hide
And I won't say it anymore

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet [x2]

There are lots of to lead away
To what we searching for
So I'm million miles from yesterday
And it's right here on the floor
This is the last time I tell you to open your eyes
The city is sleeping on the monsters outside
The fire is burning there's no way to hide
And I won't say it anymore

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet
