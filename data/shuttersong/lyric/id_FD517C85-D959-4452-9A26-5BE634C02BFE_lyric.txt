Got my heart made up on you

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

You said what you said
When words are knives it's hard not to forget
But something in my head wouldn't reset
Can't give up on us yet
No whoa (No whoa)

Your love was so real
It pulled me in just like a magnetic field
I'd let you go but something's taking the wheel
Yeah, it's taking the wheel
Oh oh

My mind says no you're no good for me
You're no good
But my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give
Got my heart made up on you

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

Got my heart made up on you

I should be making a break
Up all night thinking I'm planning my escape
But this insomnia ain't goin' away
And now I'm back at your place
Oh no

My mind says no you're no good for me
You're no good
But my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give
Got my heart made up on you

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

Got my heart made up on you

Look what you did
What you did
What you're doing to me
You got me searching for the words like a silent movie
I can't breathe
I can't see
It's so out of control
But baby honestly my hands are up I'm letting go
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)

Got my heart made up on you

My mind says no you're no good for me
You're no good
But my heart's made up on you
My body can't take what you give to me
What you give
Got my heart made up on you

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

Got my heart made up on you

Up on you
Up on you
(Yeah)

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
