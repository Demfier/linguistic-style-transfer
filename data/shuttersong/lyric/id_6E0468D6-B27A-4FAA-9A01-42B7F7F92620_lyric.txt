been fighting with my sheets
nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battering that welt-up gripe
the most frustrating type
you should have racing stripes
the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot
and you press it in my chest,and you make me weeze
into my knees you do promote me
i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i will be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the night it fidgets through
the photo soon reverts to you
i'm about as bashful as a tribal dance
the first and final chance
and course the audience are frighteners and theives
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam
she broke everyones heart
i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirot
more than i will be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable bred
it's been long enough now
so let's make a mess, lioness
i'm pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark
dark...
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
