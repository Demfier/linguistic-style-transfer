What do you mean? ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart.
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining.
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, making love all night.
First you up and you're down and then between
Ohh I really want to knowâ€¦
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh Oh Oh
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
(Leondre)
when we're away we can't get enough
when we're together we only lose touch
cause i feel like I'm in heaven when i think of you girl
you tell me that you hate me, and you are my world
all we do is fight from night to day
telling me to leave then you want me to stay
I need you to be mine
rising up and then we shine
cause your the one
and i want you in my life
i never wanna leave i want you to be my wife
it's everytime that I breathe
I have a vision of us together beautifully.

Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh Oh Oh
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh Oh Oh
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
