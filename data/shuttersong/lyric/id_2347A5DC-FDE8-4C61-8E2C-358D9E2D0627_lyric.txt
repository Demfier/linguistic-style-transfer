Once I was 7 years old, my mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was 7 years old.

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11 smoking herbs and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory, just always seemed to bore me
'cus only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'cus I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favour
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother, I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old
My daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children comes and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old
Will I think the world is cold
or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Will I think the world is cold
or will I have a lot of children who can bore me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Once I was 7 years old, mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was 7 years old
