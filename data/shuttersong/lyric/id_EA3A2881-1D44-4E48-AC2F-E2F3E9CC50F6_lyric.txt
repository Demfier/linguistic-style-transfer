Love's Divine - Seal
Then the rainstorm came over me
And I felt my spirit break
I had lost all of my belief you see
And realize my mistake
But time through a prayer to me
And all around me became still
I need love  love's divine
Please forgive me now I see
That I've been blind
Give me love 
Loves is what I need to help me know my name
Through the rainstorm came sanctuary
And I felt my spirit fly
I had found all of my reality
I realize what it takes
'Cause I need love  love's divine
Please forgive me now I see that
I've been blind
Give me love 
Loves is what I need to help me know my name
Oh I  don't bend  don't bend  don't break  don't break
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know my name
Well I try to say there's nothing wrong
But inside I felt me lying all alone
But the message here was plain to see
Believe in me
'Cause I need love  love's divine
Please forgive me now I see that
I've been blind
Give me love 
Love is what I need to help me know my name
Oh I  don't bend  don't bend  don't break  don't break
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know my name
Love can help me know my name
