Jaws all drop at the candyshop when we walk in the store
 It's a frightening display 
Mothers hide their children's eyes and hurry toward the door
 I don't even want to know the things that they will say But they can't take our love away
 We try to eat on Crawford Street on a summer afternoon 
We're just met with cold dismay 
The owner storms the table and he takes away my spoon, and says "We're not some kind of new cafe
 Where freaks like you are on display" 
But he can't take our love away 
Whoever said that love is blind, didn't understand mankind 
What he really meant to say, was love can't see... shades of grey 
The fat old boys in Washington, they like to kill our fun fun fun Man, they sure don't like to play
 They care more about the bedroom than they do about the boardroom That's the price we gotta pay
 But they can't take our love away
