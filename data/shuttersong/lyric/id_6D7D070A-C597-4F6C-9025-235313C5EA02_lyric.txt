I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la

We on our way back, we wanna play back
We want some new plus oh never change that
We on a new tip, good music
We see the pen and the paper, we gon' use it
It takes a late night, to get them bright lights
We keep writing them songs, still live that good life
I do it for you, I do it for me
We break it down, Colbie, tell them the story

Listen can you hear me
Am I coming in on your frequency
I got a story
Subject of the plot, you and me
And when you're sleeping, and when you awaken
And when you're feeling good
I'll be the thing that you want to sing back
Stuck in your head like I knew you would

I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la la la la la

I wanna be your melody
Flowing through your head, when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la

You'll be singing like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Turn it up

Baby can you feel me
I'm the kick drum that gets your heart to beat
I gotta have you near me
You can count me in to every song I sing

And when you're sleeping, and when you awaken
And when you're feeling good
I'll be the one that you want to comeback
Stuck in your head like I knew I would

We on our way back, we wanna play back
We want some new plus o never change that
We on our way back, we wanna play back
Play back play back play back play back

I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la

I wanna be your melody
Flowing through your head, when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la

You'll be singing like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Girl the songs you sing
They my favorite things
You stay in my dreams
Somthing supreme

Love is the key, and it's made your life see
Common and colbie i'm dusting off the old me
Like the OLB we call it ODs
And in your melodies, i'm hearing things you never told me

We stay in tune with each other, and our room will discover new ways to do covers, no matter how they dub us
We should stay true to the trust, and the winner of the best
Do O is us

I wanna be your favorite song
You can turn it up, play me all night long
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la

I wanna be your melody
Flowing through your head, when you think of me
I wanna be your favorite song
La la la la la

You'll be singing like
