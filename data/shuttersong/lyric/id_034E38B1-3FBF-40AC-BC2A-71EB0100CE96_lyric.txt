We were born to fly
So let's keep livin' till it all falls down
Let's close our eyes
And let the moment shut the whole world out

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever

This one's for you
This one's for you

Waving coloured flags
We won't surrender, there's no standing down
Love's a playing field
It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever

This one's for you
This one's for you

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever

This one's for you
