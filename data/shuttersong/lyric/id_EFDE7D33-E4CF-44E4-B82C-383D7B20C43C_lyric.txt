Santa Baby (feat  Liz Gillies) - Ariana Grande
Santa Baby 
Slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa Baby 
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby 
A 54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you  dear
Santa baby 
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the Fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check out my Christmas list
Santa Baby 
I want a yacht and really that's not
A lot
Been an angel all year
Santa Baby 
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Honey 
One thing that i really need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa Baby 
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let¡äs see if you believe in me
Santa Baby 
Forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa Baby 
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
