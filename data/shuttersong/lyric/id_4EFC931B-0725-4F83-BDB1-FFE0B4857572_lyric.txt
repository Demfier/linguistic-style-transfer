What does it look like in heaven
Is it peaceful, is it free like they say
Does the sun shine bright forever
Have your fears and your pain gone away
Here on earth it feels like everything, good is missing
since you left
and here on earth everythings different
there's an emptiness
oh oh I, I hope your dancing in the sky
I hope the angels know what they have
I'll bet it's so nice up in heaven since you arrived
Now tell me what do you do up in heaven
are your days filled with love and light
is there music, is there art and invention
tell me are you happy, are you more alive
cause here on earth it feels like everything good is missing
since you left
and here on earth everythings different
there's an emptiness
oh oh I, I hope your dancing in the sky
and I hope the angels know what they have
I'll bet it's so nice up in heaven since you arrived
since you've arrived.
