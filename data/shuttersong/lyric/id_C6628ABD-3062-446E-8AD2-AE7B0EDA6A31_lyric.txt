Don't upset the rhythm, no
Don't upset the rhythm

The time is right
The sun is sleeping in the sky
Free yo' mind
You never know what you might find

What's your vice?
You know we won't compromise
So let me show you
Something super beautiful

Let's rock the boat
The magic is unstoppable
For on the floor
It's the rhythm you've been waiting for

Pure delight
Kick, snare, hat ride
It's all up to you
And whatever you do
Don't cut into my action
Four, three, two, one

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm no
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm

Skin and bones
And a baton microphone
Can't get home
But you can use my dog and bone

We'll crank that stereo
Even when the speakers blow
D I Y
Just meet me up in paradise

Whatever it takes
To carry you away
It all comes down to actions
Four, three, two, one

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm though
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm

Go baby, go baby go
Go baby, go baby go
This time I like it
Go baby, go baby go
Now don't you dare
Don't upset the rhythm

Don't upset the rhythm, no
Don't upset the rhythm
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
I told you, don't upset the rhythm

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
Don't upset the rhythm

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby go

Don't upset the rhythm
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare

Hey
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm

Go baby, go baby go
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
Don't upset the rhythm
