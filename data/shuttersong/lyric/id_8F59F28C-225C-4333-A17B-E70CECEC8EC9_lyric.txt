Step out of the car and now I'm walking into her house
So loud there's people talking up a storm cloud
About the things they want to do to me now

Oh yeah
So I heard, I heard that you've been looking for a new man
And now I've gotta come up with a game plan
Uh oh I'm digging deeper than I should

I, I only have eyes for you
I only have love for two
And now I'm gonna give it all to you
To you, to you
Cause I, I only have eyes for you
And now that it's time to choose
I know I'm gonna give it all to you
to you, to you

What do I do? I'm sick of looking all around here for you
I started sipping on my grey goose (get loose)
And nothings making me forget you oh no
Damn girl, I think I'm getting closer to you right now
I can taste it on my tongue and now I scream out
How I want you so bad, yeah

I, I only have eyes for you
I only have love for two
And now I'm gonna give it all to you
To you, to you
Cause I, I only have eyes for you
And now that it's time to choose
I know I'm gonna give it all to you
to you, to you

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh baby yeah
Come let me love you now
Oh let me show you how
Let me show you how, how, how

Cause I, I only have eyes for you
And I've gotta make a move
I'm gonna bring it all to you, all to you

Cause I, I only have eyes for you
And now that it's time to choose
I know I'm gonna give it all to you
to you, to you
Cause I, I only have eyes for you
I, I only have eyes for you
I, I, I, I, I
