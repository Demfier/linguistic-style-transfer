So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in the swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows outta nowhere on the candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would pretend to be tonight
Cause Lord she found me just in time

Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt cause God I never felt young

She's gonna save me
Call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Then again she wouldn't care
We'll steal a Lexus
Be detectives
Ride around, digging up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise them on rhythm and blues

Lord it would be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
With every version of me I've buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Help me lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world, good God it wasn't for us
She's gonna save me
Call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Then again she wouldn't care
We'll steal a Lexus
Be detectives
Ride around digging up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise them on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the dream that night where my mind was set
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
Start digging up the yard for what's left of me and our little vignette
And whatever fools gold is coming next

She's gonna save me
Call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Then again she wouldn't care
We'll steal a Lexus
Be detectives
ide around digging up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise them on rhythm and blues
