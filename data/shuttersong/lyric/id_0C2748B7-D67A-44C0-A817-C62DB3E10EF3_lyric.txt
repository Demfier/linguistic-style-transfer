I had everything I ever wanted in my life 
Wasn't lookin' for nobody to be satisfied 
Wasn't looking for a honey or a steady girl 
'Til I turned around the corner 
And you rocked my world 
You was walkin' down the street 
Body boomin' to the beat 
You had everything complete 
You was cold- too cold 
And the funky things you said 
Was like music to my head 
And you turnded around and said 
Baby let's go 

You're so sexual...(sexual) 
So intellectual...(so incrediable) so emotional (emotional) 
You have everything I want... 
Everything I need 

[Chorus:] 
Upside down you're turning me 
Ooh it's an emergency 
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love (Crazy Love) 
I want your body next to me 
Ooh with such an urgency
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love 

I hear everybody talkin' 
That your mind ain't right 
And my friends say I gone crazy girl but that's alright 
Cuz the things we do together 
They mean so much more 
Boy you got me feeling things 
I've never felt before 

You're so sexual...(Sexual) 
So intellectual...(So Incrediable) so incrediable (Emotional) 
You have everything I want... 

[Chorus x2:] 
Upside down you're turning me 
Ooh it's an emergency 
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love (Crazy Love) 
I want your body next to me 
Ooh with such an urgency
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love 

Do you know what you want baby ? 
Do you like what you see ? 
Mmmm, Do you wanna have some fun with me ? 
I can give you just a little taste 
Just a little bit 
I can give it all to you 
Can you handle it- Huh!

Let me have it all, yes 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
oh 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, Everything need yeah- 

[Chorus:] 
Upside down you're turning me 
Ooh it's an emergency 
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love (Crazy Love) 
I want your body next to me 
Ooh with such an urgency
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love 

You know you drive me crazy, 
You know you drive me crazy for your crazy love, 
You know you drive me crazy, 
You know you drive me crazy for your crazy love, 
You know you do, 
You know you do, you drive me crazy, come on, you know 
You drive me, you know you do you know you do, drive me crazy, you know 
You drive me- Crazy for your CRAZY LOVE !
