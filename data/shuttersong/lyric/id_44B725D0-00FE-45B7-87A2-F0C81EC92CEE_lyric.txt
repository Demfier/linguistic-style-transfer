Fingerprints on my skin
Constellations that begin
Where we touched
The sky in crying
So am I
Cause your love is running dry
It just won't stop
Hoohoohooooo
Heavy heart, growing cold
And it's sinking like a stone
Bound to drown
Guess you're not coming back
Cause you covered all your tracks
Without a sound
I know, I won't follow you this time
I have to go alone
Into the night
Into the night
I'll be chasing, whatever's left
Of the rest of my life
Into the night
Learn to walk, on my own
Look towards the unknown
Souls are lost, a complete disconnect
Cause no streets are leading back
To where our paths crossed
I know, I won't follow you this time
I have to go alone
Into the night
Into the night
I'll be chasing, whatever's left
Of the rest of my life
Into the night
