Are you listening?
Hear me talk, hear me sing.
Open up the door
Is it less, is it more?
When you tell me to beware
Are you here? Are you there?
Is it something I should know?
Easy come, easy go.
Nodding your head
Don't hear a word I said
I can't communicate, when you wait, don't relate
I try to talk to you
But you never even knew
So what's it gonna be?
Tell me can you hear me?
I'm so sick of it
Your attention deficit
Never listen, never listen.
I'm so sick of it
So I'll throw another fit.
Never listen, never listen.

I scream your name
It always stays the same.
I scream and shout
So what I'm gonna do now
Is freak the freak out, hey!
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh.

Patience running thin
Running thin, come again
Tell me what I get
Opposite, opposite
Show me what is real
If it breaks does it heal?
Open up your ear
Why you think that I'm here?
Keep me in the dark
Are you even thinking of me?
Is someone else above me
Gotta know, gotta know
What am I gonna do?
'Cause I can't get through to you
So what's it gonna be?
Tell me can you hear me?

(Can you hear me?)

I'm so sick of it
Your attention deficit
Never listen, never listen.
I'm so sick of it
So I'll throw another fit.
Never listen, never listen.

I scream your name
It always stays the same.
I scream and shout
So what I'm gonna do now
Is freak the freak out, hey!
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go

(Can you hear me?)

I scream your name
It always stays the same.
I scream and shout
So what I'm gonna do now
Is freak the freak out, hey!
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
