I see skies of blue, and clouds of white 
the bright blessed day
the dark sacred night
and I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
and I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"
They're really sayin' "I love you"

I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

[Instrumental]

All the colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"
They're really sayin' "I love you"

I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world
