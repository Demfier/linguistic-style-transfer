We should listen to each other's hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you 'bout that action
Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Still we beat that's how I'm feeling,
Let' em know we in the buildin'
From the floor up to the ceiling

If you bout it let's start chillin'
Doing moving we can party
Who's in our business? Everybody
But it's alright 'cause I'm still living
Like 2 Chainz baby I'm different, come here now

Let me tell you little some' little some'
That you might wanna know about me
I don't play no game, baby listen
Baby if you can love me then come show me!

We should listen to each other's hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you 'bout that action
Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Darling we should take a ride
Cruising, flirting while we drive
Nothing could come kill our vibe
Got no worries on my mind
Now we're living, living good
Young and misunderstood,
Got me tripping, you drive me crazy
You know you wanna be my baby.
Let me tell you little some' little some'
That you might wanna know about me

I don't play no game, baby listen
Baby if you can love me then come show me!
We should listen to each other's hearts

Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you bout that action
Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby

Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Even though I'm on the grind
Think about you all the time

Now I know, that you're the one
Let's have fun, have fun, while we're young.
We should listen to each other's hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen if you bout that action
Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
