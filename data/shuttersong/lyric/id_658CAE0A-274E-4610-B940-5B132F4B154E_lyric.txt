Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a Sheik
I'm throwin' these Emirates in the sky
Spendin' this As-salam alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y.
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up
'Cause I'm swole up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold bra
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city, it's ova
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikovas
I set records, ratchets hold up
(I set records, ratchets hold up)

I know what you came here to see
If you a freak, then you come home wit me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bus' it open
Let me see you get loose

It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
And they already know me
It's goin' down for real

It's goin' down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah, my girl, you never seen her
'Cause my tints by limousiners
My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus, yo man a minus
My team blowin' on that slam
Make you cough-cough, that's Bronchitis
Put yo hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hatin' I get money
Then I double on tonkas

I know what you came here to see
If you a freak, then you come home wit me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bus' it open
Let me see you get loose

It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real

Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it

It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
It's goin' down for real
