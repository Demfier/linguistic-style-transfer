Talking loud talking crazy
Lock me outside
Praykng for the rain to come
Bone dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
I'm in your way
It hurts, that I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Crash and we're burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
What I did for love
What I did for love
I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
It was too much at stake
It hurts, that I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for
I can't believe what I did for love
