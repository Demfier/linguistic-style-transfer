Want To Want Me - Jason Derulo\n Derulo\n It's so hard to sleep\n I got the sheets on the floor\n Nothing on me\n And I can't take it no more\n It's a hundred degrees\n I got one foot out the door\n Where are my keys\n 'Cause I gotta leave  yeah\n In the back of the cab\n I tip the driver  head of time\n Give me there fast\n I got your body on my mind\n I want it bad\n Ooh  just the thought of you gets me so high  so high\n Girl  you're the one\n I want you to want me\n And if you want me girl you got me\n There's nothing I know I wouldn't do  I wouldn't do\n Just to get up next you\n Girl  you're the one\n I want you to want me\n And if you want me girl you got me\n There's nothing I know I wouldn't do  I wouldn't do\n Just to get up next you\n Just to get up next you\n You open the door\n Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor\n And you whisper in my ear  baby I'm yours\n Ooh  just the thought of you gets me so high\n So high so high\n Girl  you're the one\n I want you to want me\n And if you want me girl you got me\n There's nothing I know I wouldn't do  I wouldn't do\n Just to get up next you\n Girl  you're the one\n I want you to want me\n And if you want me girl you got me\n There's nothing I know I wouldn't do  I wouldn't do\n Just to get up next you\n Just to get up next you\n Just the thought of you gets me so high  so high\n Ooh  just the thought of you gets me so high  so high\n Girl  you're the one\n I want you to want me\n And if you want me girl you got me\n There's nothing I know I wouldn't do  I wouldn't do\n Just to get up next you\n Girl  you're the one\n I want you to want me\n And if you want me girl you got me\n There's nothing I know I wouldn't do  I wouldn't do\n Just to get up next you\n I'll do anything\n Just to get up next you\n Anything is everything\n Just to get up next you\n Baby\n Just to get up next you\n Oh get up get up
