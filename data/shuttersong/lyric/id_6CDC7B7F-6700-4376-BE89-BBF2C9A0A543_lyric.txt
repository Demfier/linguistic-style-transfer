Bring it bring it back like she left some-
In the club with the lights off
Whatchu acting shy for?
Come and show me that you're with it with it with it with it with it
Stop playing, now you know that I'm with it with it with it with it with it with it
Whatchu acting shy for?

Just gimme you, just gimme you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true

Guaranteed, I can back it up
I think I'm a call you bluff
Hurry up, I'm waitin' out front

Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight
