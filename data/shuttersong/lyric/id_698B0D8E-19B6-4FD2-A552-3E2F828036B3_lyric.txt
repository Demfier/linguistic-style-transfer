Once in a lifetime
It's just right
We make no mistakes
Not even the landslide or riptide
Could take it all the way

Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone's calling my name
It sounds like you

When i close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side

Once in a lifetime
It's just right
That we are always safe

Not even the bad guys, in the dark night
Could take it all the way

Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same

Out loud, someoneÂ´s calling my name
And it sounds like you
When i close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
Once in a lifetime you were mine
