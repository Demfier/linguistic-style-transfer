All the times
That it slipped my mind to mention
That you're the one I need
And if I forgot to tell you
I was wrong to ever doubt it
And you're all I think about yeah
There's a million words I should've said...
I remember you were standing in my doorway

And the words were on my lips

That you've never looked so beautiful
Oh, just to be near you
Don't you know how good that feels?
These are all the things I should've said
Did I miss my chance? Is it too late? To say...
Now I'm half a world away from you
But you're always on my mind
There's a million words that I could've said

And you might still be mine
If there's someone where I used to be
I hope he tells you everyday
With a million words that I should've said

I wish I could tell you always

When you were mine, did I push you far away?
Blame this whole weight on my shoulders
Baring down on me
But then I only had to see you
Don't you know how good that feels?
These are all the words I should've said
Did I miss my chance? Is it too late? To say...

Now I'm half a world away from you
But you're always on my mind
There's a million words that I could've said
And you might still be mine

And if there's someone where I used to be
I hope he tells you everyday
With a million words that I should've said
I wish I could tell you always
And if I could only catch your eye and throw a smile
Maybe, I could start to say what's screaming in my mind
You should know that what I want to say could take all night
Or my whole life
Do I get a second chance to make you mine tonight?
Now I'm half a world away from you
But you're always on my mind
There's a million words that I could've said
And you might still be mine
But if I ever get the chance again
I would tell you everyday
With a million words that I should've said
I wish I could tell you always...
Always...
Always...
Always...
Always.
