Here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus,
Right down santa claus lane.
Vixen, blitzen, and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins.
Bells are ringing, children singing,
All is merry and bright.
Hang your stockings and say your prayers,
Cause santa claus comes tonight.
.
Here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus,
Right down santa claus lane.
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again.
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,
What a beautiful sight.
Jump in bed, cover up your head,
Cause santa claus comes tonight.
Here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus,
Right down santa claus lane.
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor,
For he loves you just the same.
Santa knows that we're god's children,
That makes everything right.
Fill your hearts with christmas cheer,
Cause santa claus comes tonight
.
Here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus,
Right down santa claus lane.
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
When the Christmas morn again.
Peace on earth will come to all,
If we just follow the light.
Fill your hearts with christmas cheer,
Cause santa claus comes tonight.
Peace on earth will come to all,
If we just follow the light.
Let's give thanks to the lord above,
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!
Let's give thanks to the lord above,
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!
Tonight!Tonight!...
