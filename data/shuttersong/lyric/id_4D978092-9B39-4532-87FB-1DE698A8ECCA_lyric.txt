When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dreams
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
A sweet fullfillment of their secret longing
Like a boat out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through

Moma when you wished upon a star
Your dreams come true

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fullfillment of their secret longing
Like a boat out of the blue
Fate steps in and see's you through

Baby when you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Your dreams come true
