Sha la la la la la la, hmm, uh huh,
I was down at the New Amsterdam,
Staring at this yellow-haired girl,
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation,
With a black-haired flamenco dancer,
You know she dances while his father plays guitar,
So she's suddenly beautiful,
And we all want something beautiful,
Man I wish I was beautiful.

So come dance this silence down through the mornin'
Sha la la la la la la la yeah, uh huh yeah,
Curl up, Maria! Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones.
Believe in me, help me believe in anything,
'Cause I, I wanna be someone who believes, yeah.

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales,
And we stare at the beautiful women,
\
