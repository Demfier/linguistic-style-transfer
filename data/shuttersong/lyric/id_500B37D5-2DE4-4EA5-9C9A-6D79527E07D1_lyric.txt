My hands, your hands,
Tied up like two ships.
Drifting, weightless,
Waves try to break it.
I'd do anything to save it,
Why is it so hard to save it ?
My heart, your heart, sit tight like book ends,
Pages between us, written with no ints.
So many words we're not saying.
Don't want to wait till it's gone.
You make me strong.
I'm sorry , fussy I need you,
But I don't care I'm not scared of love
Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker,
Is that so wrong ? Is it so wrong ?
That you make me strong.
Think of, how much,
Love that's been wasted,
People always, trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking,
But there's nothing I'm running from,
You make me strong,
I'm sorry, fussy, I need you,
But I don't care I'm not scared of love
Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker,
Is that so wrong ? Is it so wrong ?
So baby, ho-old on, to my heart,
Need you to keep me from falling in love,
I'll always ho-old on,
Cause you make me strong,
I'm sorry, fussy, I need you,
But i don't care I'm not scared of love,
When I'm not with you I'm weaker,
Is that so wrong ? Is it so wrong ?
I'm sorry, fussy I need you,
But I don't care I'm not scared of love
Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker,
Is that so wrong ? Is it so wrong ?
That you make me strong
I'm sorry I'm fussy I need you.
But I don't care I'm not scared of love,
Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker,
Is that so wrong ? Is it so wrong ?
That you make me strong
