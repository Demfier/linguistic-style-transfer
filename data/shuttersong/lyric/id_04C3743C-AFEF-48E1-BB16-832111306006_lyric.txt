Lavender's blue, dilly dilly,
Lavender's green
When you are king, dilly dilly,
I shall be queen

Who told you so, dilly dilly,
Who told you so?
'Twas my own heart, dilly dilly,
That told me so

Call up your men, dilly, dilly
Send them to work
Some to the plough, dilly dilly,
Some to the fork

Some to make hay, dilly dilly,
Some to cut corn
While you and I, dilly dilly,
Keep ourselves warm

Lavender's green, dilly dilly,
Lavender's blue
If you love me, dilly dilly,
I will love you

Let the birds sing, dilly dilly,
And the lambs day
We shall be safe, dilly dilly,
Out of arms way

I love to dance, dilly, dilly,
I love to sing
When I am queen, dilly, dilly,
You'll be my king
You told me so, dilly, dilly,
you told me so.
I told my self, dilly, dilly,
I told me so.
