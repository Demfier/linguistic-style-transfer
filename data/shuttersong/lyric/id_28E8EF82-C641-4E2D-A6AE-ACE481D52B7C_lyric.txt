I'm gonna I-I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out (1er )
Don't watch me watch the t-t-tv
I'm swaggin' when you se-e-e me
I'm shining bright you'll fall in lo-o-o-ove (in love)
I'm a rider, I ride like a hardley
Start it up and start up the party
Livin' it up swag it out my way
Nicki Minaj havin' pink fridays
Shalalala lots of paper
Lalalala don't trip off haters
Got my hair it's done, my nails they're done
Swaggin' so hard all eyes are on me

(Refrain)
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out (2ème )
Pretty like Beyoncé, big time like Kanye
Imma rock out rock out like Green Day
Imma act out act on no screen play
Swag it out Wassup?
I really wanna I promise that I'm gonna
Swag it all out show off like a stunner
I really wanna I promise that I'm gonna
Swag it all out stay hotter than the summer

(Pré-refrain)
Shalalala lots of paper
Lalalala Don't trip off haters
Yeah my hair it's done my nails they're done
Swaggin' so hard all eyes are on me

(Refrain)
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out (Bridge)
Let the bass bang Throw your hands in the air (air, air)
Hands in the air (air, air) Throw-Throw your hands in the air
(Throw your hands in the air) Let the bass bang
And throw your hands in the air H-H-hands in the air
Throw-Throw your hands in the air

(Refrain)
Swag it out
I'm gonna I'm gonna g-g-g-gonna swag it out
