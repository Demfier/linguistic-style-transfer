The sun the trees the leaves the ground the sound it makes
When love sings songs of love to them

I try all day to not write songs that sound clich√©
When I sing songs of love to you
But somehow I always do

And then I realize
After a million years
The wind song goes along

That's how I wanna be
Until eternity
The wind song goes along

I'm glad it's clear the rain this year came down so strong
To test my song of love for you

I love you still and always will
So if my song repeats
Know that I'm stuck on you
Oh yes I'm stuck on you

And then I realize
After a million years
The wind song goes along
Oh yes I realize after a million years
The windsong goes along

I'm glad it's clear the rain this year came down so strong
To test my song of love for you

I love you still and always will
So if my song repeats
Know that I'm stuck on you
I'm stuck on you

And then I realize
After a million years
The wind song goes along
The wind song goes along
The wind song goes along
Oohhh
The wind song goes along
