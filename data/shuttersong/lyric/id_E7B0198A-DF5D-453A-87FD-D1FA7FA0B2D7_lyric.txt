She's in one of them moods. Haha
Yeah you blow me up
Then I wait a little while
Because I know its probably fine
Then you blow me off
Don't mean to laugh when you're mad
But you're like this all the time
Oh I get it
You love me
Hate me
It's crazy
Lately
You're so emotional
It kills me
Thrills me
Can't shake
I'll take
This rollercoaster love
You're screaming all night
Till the break of dawn
Find a pair of my pants
On the neighbours lawn
Throw all my stuff
Outside
You say goodbye
And slam the door closed
Call me all night
You cry
Say you'll die
If I don't come home
Turn me on and then go cold
You're so hot when you're psycho
Smile when I smile
thats why
It's you and I
And all your MoodSwings
It's you and I
And all your MoodSwings
It's you and I
And all your MoodSwings
Heavens
Why do they hurt so good
When it
Feels right
And then its all wrong
The next minute
Hey hey
But you know that I'm still your guy
Even when I'm sky high
On your bipolar ride
Yeah you love me
Hate me
It's crazy
Lately
You're so emotional
It kill me
Thrills me
Can't shake
I'll take
This rollercoaster love
Screaming all night
Till the break of dawn
Find a pair of my pants
On the Neighbours lawn
Throw all my stuff
Outside
You say goodbye
And slam the door closed
Call me all night
You cry
Say you'll die
If I don't come home
Turn me on and then go cold
You're so hot when you're psycho
Smile when I smile
Thats why
It's You and I
And all your MoodSwings
It's You and I
And all your MoodSwings
Push me round
On your MoodSwings
Medication
Intervention
Don't change a thing
Yeah, cause she's perfection
She's all mine
Completely out of her mind
Throw all my stuff
Outside
Damn
Call me all night
You cry
Say you'll die
HEY
Turn me on and then go cold
You're so hot when you're phyco
Smile when I smile
That's why
It's you and I
And all your MoodSwings
It's you and I
And all your MoodSwings

And all your MoodSwings
Push me round
On your MoodSwings
