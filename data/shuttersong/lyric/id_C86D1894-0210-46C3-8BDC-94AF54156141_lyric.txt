I don't know, where you are
But I'm waiting at your door everyday 
Your neighbour says you've gone away
You left, not ever, to stay 
So I move along and I
Writing songs about love
And songs about hate
I'm writing songs about hate

Well I'm not the man, I used to be
I am older, and slightly deranged
I am different in all details
Just like the United States
So I move along and I
Writing songs about love
And songs about hate
I'm writing songs about hate

#humming to the music#

I don't know if the trees will grow
or grass will get any greener
Cause all I can see is that
the fields are free and we
Ain't going nowhere
nowhere but here
