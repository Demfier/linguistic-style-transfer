 master of sorrow 
Won't feel again 
Suffer no more 
This time my heart is cold 
You are standing right before 
The  master  of  sorrow 
I am the  master  of  sorrow 
Feels like yesterday now 
I can see it all so clear 
You were closer whispering 
It's you and me that count right now 
I thought that the voice I was hearing 
Was so completely sincere 
Years have passed since that day 
My mourning has come to an end 
I know you're still out there 
Regretting the choices that you made 
I won't follow you this time 
I'll give you the pain that was mine 
You can't hurt me this time 
I'm prepared for anything 
You won't get that close now 
I'm protected from you lies 
Knowing what you will bring me 
Knowing you?
