
[Finn:]
I don't like cities
But I like New York

[Santana:]
The famous places to visit are so many

[Finn:]
Other places make me feel like a dork

[Santana:]
I told my grandpa I wouldn't miss on any

[Artie:]
Los Angeles is for people who sleep

[Mercedes:]
Got to see the whole town
Right from Yonkers on down to the Bay

[Artie:]
Paris and London
Oh baby you can keep

[Santana:]
Baby you can keep

[Mercedes:]
Baby you can keep

[Rachel and New Directions:]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York, New York
It's the old New York!
I love New York (New York, New York)
I love New York (New York, New York)

[Finn:]
If you don't like my attitude
Then you can get lost

[Santana with girls:]
Manhattan women

[Santana:]
Are dressed in silk and satin

[Finn with Artie:]
Just go to Texas

[Finn:]
Isn't that where they golf

[Santana with girls:]
There's just one thing that's

[Santana:]
Important in Manhattan

[Artie:]
New York is not for little wussies who scream (AAA!)

[Mercedes:]
Pick up a date
Maybe seven
Or eight

[Artie:]
Paris and London
Oh baby you can keep

[Santana and Mercedes:]
Baby you can keep

[New Directions:]
Baby you can keep!

[Rachel and New Directions:]
Other cities always make me mad ([Mercedes:] Make me mad)
Other places always make me sad ([Mercedes:] Make me sad)
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York, New York
It's the old New York!
I love New York (New York, New York)
I love New York (New York, New York)

[Brittany (with the girls):]
We've sailed the seas
And we've been the world over
Made the Mandalay
We've seen the Sphinx
And we've seen the Cliffs of Dover
And we can safely say

[Rachel:]
New York!

[Rachel and New Directions:]
Other cities always make me mad ([Mercedes:] Ooow!)
Other places always make me sad ([Mercedes:] New York!)
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York, New York
It's the old New York!
I love New York (New York, New York)
I love New York ([Mercedes:] New York, New York)
(New York, New York)
I love New York (New York, New York)
[Mercedes:] New York, New York

[Finn and Santana:]
New York, New York!!
