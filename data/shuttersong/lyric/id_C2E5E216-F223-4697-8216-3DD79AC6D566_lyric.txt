Well the devil may care
You toss him back and be a man
With the last time
Black ice

End of it all, end of the line
End of the road
Ooh, black ice
Black ice

Come on and bleeding out the walls
We're watching all the women go
Many a mile I'll never take
I run for forty miles and I come up runnin' late

Don't you know I live it down
When the devil come a callin' I aint gonna be around
Ooh, black ice
Black ice, yeah
Black ice, my yeah
Black Ice, my life
The devil come a callin' I aint gonna be around, Black ice
