I heard you had some trouble with your ex man
Now it's hard for you to give your loving to the next man
Only takes one time to learn the lesson
And girl my love won't have you second guessing

You should take your time baby it could be all night

Need a shoulder to cry on

Need someone to rely on

When you're stuck in the past tense got you caught up
Caught up
I feel like this could be the start of
What it should be
Girl you know I get ya gotcha
Shotgun

To just waste your time
