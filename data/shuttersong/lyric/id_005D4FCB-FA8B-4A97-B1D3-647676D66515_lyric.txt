Our secrets, you hid so well
A time capsule, the future will not find
And in the belly of a catacomb
A fuselage the future will not hide
Swalloed by his pride
It's like a mobile phone
That can't phone home
It's an endless ringing
And it's a silent drone
It is a passenger, a messanger
It's hectic and hysterical inside
They throw away our nation's pride and caution to the wind
Like bank notes in the
Like bank notes in the bin

So make angels in the snow, love a little more
Live with no regrets, for everything you do
Because although the lights are on
There is no one home
And everything you are, everything you were
Everything you've been's not everything you'll be
You tell me I'm a grain of sand
In an hour glass

So throw me a land line

This is more like a land mine
Just one crossed wire
You'll blow the floor beneath our feet and the houses of
The million civillians
Pre-packed with indifference inside
They throw away our nation's pride and caution to the wind

Like bank notes in the
Like bank notes in the bin

So make angels in the snow, love a little more
Live with no regrets, for everything you do
Because although the lights are on
There is no one home.
And everything you are, everything you were
Everything you've been's not everything you'll be

We're really all the stars that burst
In the universe

Of our alienation

Well we're such a long way from home
Let's dance in this universe unknown

So make angels in the snow, love a little more
Live with no regrets, for everything you do
Because although the lights are on
There is no one home
And everything you are, everything you were

Everything you've been's not everything you'll be
We're really all the stars that burst
In the universe
Of our alienation
Of our alientation

So make angels in the snow, love a little more
Live with no regrets, for everything you do
Because although the lights are on
There is no one home
And everything you are, everything you were
Everything you've been's not everything you'll be
We're really all the stars that burst
In the universe
Of our alienation
Of our alientation
