Little things that you do
That we share, me and you are where i breathe

You still blind, me with such wonder stuff

Just one touch is all I need

It feels like I'm falling into soon
Even on stormy days
And every way, it feels like we've won

As we watched the years go by
Feels like we're still flying high

Baby you amaze me
Still knock me off my feet

And who would have ever guessed it would last through it all
The reason I believe, can you see?
You still amaze me
You still amaze me

Funny how

Everytime, that I'm down
You pick me up, you stand by me
People ask, what's the deal?
Why you still so in love?
Maybe, it's meant to be

It feels like I'm falling into soon

Even when life is like, a fight
But feels like we've won

As we watched the years go by
Feels like we're still flying high

Baby you amaze me

Still knock me off my feet

And who would have ever guessed it would last through it all
The reason I believe, can you see?
You still amaze me

It feels like I'm falling into soon
Even not stop your days
And every way feels like we're one
As we watched the years go by
Feels like we're still flying high

Baby you amaze me
Still knock me off my feet
And who would have ever guessed it would last through it all

The reason I believe, can you see?
You still amaze me
You still amaze me

You still amaze me
You still amaze me
