I´ll size it up if you want me to
it´s bigger than me, it's bigger than you
the song you love, the ones you hate,
Eyeliner voodoo

here we go again.
Bigger than you, bigger than me

love is bigger than war.
bigger than you, bigger than me
love is bigger than war
Holds us together, tears us apart

make us forget and remember who we are
just like an atom it's here and it's there

better run for cover when love is in the air
Bigger than you, bigger than me
love is bigger than war.
bigger than you, bigger than me

love is bigger than war
Bigger than The Beatles, the rolling Stones
bigger than Elvis, but not YOKO
Bigger than you, bigger than me

love is bigger than war.
Everything i learned about love, i learned it from you

everything i learned about love like what not to do
love, love glorious love makes you crazy but you want that stuff
New York love, London love, french Italian Jamaican Love.
Bigger than you, bigger than me...
just like an atom it's here and it's there
better run for cover when love is in the air
Bigger than The Beatles, the rolling Stones
bigger than Elvis, but not YOKO
Bigger than you, bigger than me
love is bigger than war...
bigger than the beatles, the rolling stones
bigger than elvis, but not yoko
bigger than you, bigger than me
love is bigger than war...
