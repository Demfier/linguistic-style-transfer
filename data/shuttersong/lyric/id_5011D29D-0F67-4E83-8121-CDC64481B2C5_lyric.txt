You are looking at
The stars tonight
Seeking the magic of life

You are looking at
The stars tonight
Seeking the god in the light
Oh and the bitch of life
Without cars, without pride
You want to overcome
The impossible fight
Make your own destiny
With your heart and the beat
Follow your favorite beat
Your remedy

Real stars
The spark of your heart
Your hea, hea, ah ah ah heart

The spark of your heart
Your hea, hea, ah ah ah heart

And now you carry on
With the sun in your face
Heading to a wonderful place

And now you carry on
The sun in your face
Living for better days

Oh at the beach of life
without cars, without pride
You want to overcome
The impossible fight
Make your own destiny
With your heart and the beat
Follow your favorite beat
Your remedy

Your hea, hea, ah ah ah heart
