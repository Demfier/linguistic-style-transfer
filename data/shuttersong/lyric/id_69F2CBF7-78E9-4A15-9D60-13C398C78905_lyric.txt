You run, like the letters on these pages.
I'm not sick but still so far away from sane.
Nightmares, but I haven't slept in ages.
The battles won, but there's still poison in our veins.
We've lost control, anything but gently down the stream.
Hold me close, hold me tell me life is but a dream.
Save me, I think I'm losing my mind.
You said you'd come for me when the world swallows me whole.
Well, this is war.
Save me, 'cause the battles won but the war is still to fight.
You said you'd come for me when the world swallows me whole.
Well, this is war.
Well, this is war.
You breathe like your lungs aren't full of matches.
Every careful word you speak has a chance of sparking fire.
I hope I can sleep straight through the madness.
But I can't even tell when I'm sleeping anymore.
We've lost control, anything but gently down the stream.
Hold me close, hold me tell me life is but a dream.
Save me, I think I'm losing my mind.
You said you'd come for me when the world swallows me whole.
Well, this is war.
Save me, 'cause the battles won but the war is still to fight.
You said you'd come for me when the world swallows me whole.
Well, this is war.
Let the darkness come for me, let it try to steal my soul.
As if I had a soul to steal. Hold me tell me life is but a dream.
Save me, I think I'm losing my mind.
