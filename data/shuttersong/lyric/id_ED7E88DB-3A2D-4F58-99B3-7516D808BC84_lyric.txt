She got cherry lips
Angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold blooded vixen, she don't compromise
She's optimistic of the coded lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do things twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Got me tripping higher than the ceiling
Ooh baby it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly

Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly

We're talking lady
Love how you in tight
Sugar we're just a rider, man spies
Sean Penn a little bit ethic, one's desire
She's out to get you, you can't burn, you can't hide
She's optimistic of the coded lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do things twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Got me tripping higher than the ceiling
Ooh baby it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly

Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly

Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly

But you won't get me tonight

Got me tripping higher than the ceiling
Ooh baby it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly

Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
Sugar how you get so fly
