Dreaming Alone - Against the Current\n The story starts laying in the dark with someone new\n I'm feeling tired from all the time I spent on you\n But I know I'm strong from all the trouble I've been through\n The story starts where the story falls apart with you\n Don't lie  bright eyes\n Is it me that you see when you fall asleep \n Cause I know it's you I dream about every night\n Giving me a feeling like\n Love in the summer\n Way I've never felt with another\n Don't lie  bright eyes\n Is it me that you see \n Tell me I'm not dreaming alone\n The story starts lying in the dark broken and bruised\n I count the scars left in my heart from losing you\n And I was wrong but let's be honest you were too\n I miss the part where I was falling hard for you\n So don't lie  bright eyes\n Is it me that you see when you fall asleep \n Cause I know it's you I dream about every night\n Giving me this feeling like\n Love in the summer\n Way I've never felt with another\n Don't lie  bright eyes\n Is it me that you see \n Tell me I'm not dreaming alone\n I can't take back the things I said\n And I won't say that I regret\n Any day that I was yours\n Don't lie  bright eyes\n I know it's me that you see when you fall asleep\n And you know it's you I dream about every night\n Giving me this feeling like\n Love in the summer\n Way I've never felt with any other\n Don't lie  bright eyes\n It'll always be you and me  so why are we dreaming alone \n It'll always be you and me  so why are we dreaming alone
