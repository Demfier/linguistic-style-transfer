The day we met
Frozen I held my breath
Right from the start
I knew that I'd found a home for my heart

To fall but watching you stand alone?
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years

I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
Every breath

Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
I will love you
A thousand years
Mmmm
Mmmm
