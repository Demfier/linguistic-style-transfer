Summer after high school when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th Birthday
We got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor

And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue
Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay

So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other We made a pact

Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on (whoa)

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the Blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine (No)
Can't replace you with a million rings (No)
I should told you what you meant to me (Whoa)
Cause now i pay the price
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
