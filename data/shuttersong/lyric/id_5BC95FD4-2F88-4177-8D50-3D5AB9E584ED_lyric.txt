Something I Need - Ben Haenow\n I had a dream the other night\n About how we only get one life\n Woke me up right after two\n Stayed awake and stared at you\n So I wouldn't lose my mind\n And I had the week\n That came from hell\n And yes I know that you could tell\n But you're like the net under the ledge\n When I go flying off the edge\n You go flying off as well\n And if you only here once I wanna live with\n You got something I need\n In this world full of people\n There's one loving me\n And if we only live once  (hey)\n I wanna live with you (you  you  you)\n You got something I need\n In this world full of people\n There's one loving me\n And if we only here once  (hey)\n I wanna live with you (you  you)\n Last night I think I drank too much \n Call it our temporary crutch\n With broken words I've tried to say\n Honey don't you be afraid\n If we got nothing we got us\n And if you only here once I wanna live with\n You got something I need\n In this world full of people\n There's one loving me\n And if we only here once  (hey)\n I wanna live with you (you  you  you)\n I know that we're not the same\n But I'm so damn glad that we made it\n To this time  this time  around \n You got something I need\n Yeah in this world full of people\n There's one loving me\n And if we only here once\n I wanna live with you (heeyy)\n You got something I need\n In this world full of people\n There's one loving me\n And if we only here once  (hey)\n I wanna live with you (you  you  you)\n You got something I need\n In this world full of people\n There's one loving me\n And if we only here once  (hey)\n I wanna live with you (you  you  you)\n If we only here once (hey)\n I wanna live with\n If we only here once I wanna live with you
