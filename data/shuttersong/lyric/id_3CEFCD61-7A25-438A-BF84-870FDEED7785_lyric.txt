These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, do I let these personalities always conflict in me

Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can't explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor

I can explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you
I can explain
Or should I know? I spend about two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain
I reside
I want God
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive
You're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
Why don't you sit and talk to me?
Let me explain it
Let me explain

My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themselves and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a 0
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections and all
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are

Ã¬
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed him knowledge
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind can travel
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Or should I know?
I spin around two times, a blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the eye
I am yours
I can explain

I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
Yours
Yours...
