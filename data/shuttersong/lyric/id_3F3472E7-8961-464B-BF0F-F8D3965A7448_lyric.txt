There's a ghost down in the hall

there's a ghoul upon the bed
there's something in the walls
there's blood up on the stairs
and it's floating through the room
and there's nothing i can see
and i know that that's the truth
because now it's onto me
I don't understand it
hey
i don't understand it!
aaow
There's a tappin' in the floor
there's a creak behind the door
there's a rocking in the chair
but there's no-one sitting there
there's a ghostly smell around
but nobody to be found
and a coughin' and a yawnin'
where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it
hey!
don't understand it
hey.
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
and who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
and who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
you put a knife in my back
shot an arrow in me!
tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
the ghost of jealousy
