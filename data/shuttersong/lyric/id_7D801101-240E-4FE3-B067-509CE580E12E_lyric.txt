Tired of the rumors and lies,
and holding inside,
the things we think you should know.
Honestly.
Sick of all the games people play,
and things that they say,
so here you go,
how bout a little bit of honesty.

Stupid fucking [x3]
Stupid lies,
Stupid fucking [x3]
Here's the fucking truth:

[James:]
I did my time,
in a Norwegian prison.
I was force fed fibrous foods and prune juice forcing me to shit out all my insides.
Yes I lost weight,
I lost my dignity.
I had hoses shoved inside my butt,
which really sucks unless you're into that kind of thing.

ohhhhh,
that sounds rough.
We liked you better fatter,
the sex was so much better when you were fatter.

[James:]
Fuuuuck you.
You guys are pricks.
I lost inches off my waistline,
but added all those inches to my dick.

[Luke:]
Why do people think I'm gay?
Why do people think I'm straight?
Why don't people understand,
I make love a different way.
I fall in love with things that are not people,
like rivers and forests and churches with steeples.
And butterfly kisses and hunger games sequels.
Why can't you understand all love is,
equal.

Stupid fucking [x3]
Stupid lies,
Stupid fucking [x3]
Here's the fucking truth:

Tell 'em Daniel.

[Daniel:]
Y'all think I'm stupid,
y'all think I'm dumb.
But when it comes to who's the smartest I'm the one.
Energy is mass time acceleration,
according to Einstein's interpretation.
Square of a hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
Euclidean geometry,
Advanced trigonometry,
A tisket a tasket,
I grasp all this math shit.
I'm not an MD,
not a PhD,
but I'm gonna find a way to feed the world off one jelly bean.
Oh oh,
One jelly bean
One jelly bean [x4]

[Jai:]
I think it's kind of tragic,
that twitter always tells me who I'm dating.
Miley, Kendal, Kylie, Perrie, Taylor, Demi, Iggy, Nicki, Harry.
I lie awake at night and wonder if this pain I feel is temporary.
You have my heart and have my soul,
This world would not be quite so cold with Harry.
Harry [x5]

[Beau:]
Y'all got it twisted that I'm sweet and that I'm shy,
But let the record show that Beau is not a nice guy!
I double park, I like to fart when I'm in crowded cars,
Burp in church and take a shit up in your cookie jar!
I bark at old ladies,
I like to scare babies,
I never hold the door open,
cuz I'm that crazy!
Fuck Australia,
fuck the Janoskians fam,
and now that I've got your attention,
I quit this fucking band!
Psych!
Haha I'm just kidding!

Stupid fucking [x3]
Stupid lies,
Stupid fucking [x3]
Here's the fucking truth:
Stupid fucking [x3]
Stupid lies,
Stupid fucking [x3]
Here's the fucking,
Stupid fucking [x3]
Stupid lies,
Stupid fucking [x3]
That's the fucking truth!
