I heard 
That you re settled down 
That you 
Found a girl 
And you re 
Married now 

I heard 
That your dreams came true 
I guess she gave you things 
I didn t give to you 

Oh friend 
Why you so shy 
Ain t like you to hold back 
Or hide from the light 

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited 
But I couldn t stay away I couldn t fight it 
I hoped you d see my face and that you be reminded 
That for me 
It isn t over 

Nevermind 
I ll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too 
Don t forget me 
I beg 
I ll remember you still 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Yeah 

You know how the time flies 
Only yesterday 
It was the time of our lives 
We were born and raised 
In a summer haze 
Bound by the surprise 
Of our glory days 

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited 
But I couldn t stay away I couldn t fight it 
I hoped you d see my face and be reminded 
That for me 
It isn t over 

Nevermind 
I ll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too 
Don t forget me 
I beg 
I ll remember you still 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 

Nothing compares 
No worries or cares 
Regrets and mistakes 
And memories made 
Who would have known 
How bittersweet 
This would taste 

Nevermind 
I ll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you 
Don t forget me 
I beg 
I ll remember you still 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 

Nevermind 
I ll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too 
Don t forget me 
I beg 
I ll remember you still 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead
