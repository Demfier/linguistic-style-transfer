It almost feels
like it was just a dream
all these memories of you and me

Blown away
in the summer breeze
It almost feels like

we just never were
all this time we spent was just a blur

Now it's just me and a melody
So what am I

Supposed to do
'Cause all these plans
we made in the sand
are through

Without you
I'm on my own
Am I'm gonna be alone
And if it's only
me, myself and I

will I be fine
So far from home
and I just don't know
am I gonna make it
brave enough to
take this road
Out on my own

And maybe I'm falling on my face
Or maybe I'm landing in my place
And maybe we're a million miles apart
Or maybe we're standing heart to heart
But no matter what
I'm walking
Right off this stage
I'll never look you back

Look you back
to yesterday
No, way
No, way...

I'm on my own!
Yeah
As long as I got
Me, myself and I
I'm doing fine
So far from home
but now i know that
I am gonna make it
brave enough to
take this road
Out on my own
It almost feels
like it was just a dream
all these memories of you and me
