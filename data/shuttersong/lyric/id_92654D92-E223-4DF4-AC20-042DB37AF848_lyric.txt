Aye ma, You looking real nice
With the long blond hair, rockin' calvin kleins, and uh
I can really get used to it
The way you walk in I'm about to lose my shit, I swear
She's the only one, they all should be
But should'a, could'a, would'a, nothing's perfect Bill Cosby
It's just a normal day to your office job livin'
Work 8 to 5 but you wanna slow sip it
And you're sick of all the bullshit, you wanna make decisions
Dreams of top dollars, but stuck with the vision
Now I know this what you're feelin', I can see it in your eyes
No more hidin' what you're feelin', no more pain or disguise
So rise up, roll one, higher
Feet are on the ground but I'm found floating back to you like

Aye ma, Watchu lookin' at? (Oh nah)
Aye ma, Watchu lookin' at? (I was like)
Aye ma, Watchu lookin' at?
No more hidin' away

Let's go fly to a place unknown
Aye ma, Watchu lookin' at? (Oh nah)
Aye ma, Watchu lookin' at? (I was like)
Aye ma, Watchu lookin' at?
No more hidin' away
Let's go fly to a place unknown
God damn, now I'm here. Watchu want from me?
I need a down ass chick that can work the D
I'll stick with it up all night no question
Learn lessons until the day we're set free
Now let me see what I'm workin' with

Hands by your side
Now it's time to nose dive like all the angels in the sky
Lookin' down over all of us
Keepin' it okay

Blessed but not like the rest of 'em
So roll up like a J and inhale, exhale

The worry sailed away you say time after time that you feel some type of way
But don't tell me what I wanna know

Tell me how it is
So damn beautiful I'm over here noticin' you like
