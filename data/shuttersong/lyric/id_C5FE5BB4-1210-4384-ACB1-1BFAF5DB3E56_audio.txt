 piss off your parents,
Date me to scare them
Show them you¡¯re all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attracts you
Baby then you¡¯re in luck
And I know it¡¯s just a phase
You¡¯re not in love with me
You wanna  piss  off  your  parents baby
You wanna  piss  off  your  parents,
That¡¯s alright with me
Verse 2:
You know, I¡¯m broke, so you pulled out  your daddy¡¯s card
I drink, I smoke, you ate it up from the very first start
Should have seen this coming, from a mile away
I¡¯ll play  your game
I know what you want from me
I know what you want from me
Chorus:
So if you wanna  piss  off  your  parents,
Date me to scare them
Show them you¡¯re all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attracts you
Baby then you¡¯re in luck
And I know it¡¯s just a phase
You¡¯re not in love with me
You wanna  piss  off  your  parents baby
You wanna  piss  off  your  parents,
That¡¯s alright with me
I know what you want from me
Chorus:
So if you wanna  piss  off  your  parents,
Date me to scare them
Show them you¡¯re all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attracts you
Baby then you¡¯re in luck
And I know it¡¯s just a phase
You¡¯re not in love with me
And I know it¡¯s just a phase
You¡¯re not in love with me
You wanna  piss  off  your  parents baby
You wanna  piss  off  your  parents,
That¡¯s alright
You wanna  piss  off  your  parents baby
You wanna  piss  off  your ?arents,
That¡¯s alright with me
