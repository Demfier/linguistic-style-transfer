Don't wake me up
Took so long for me
To fall asleep last night
Through tears I could hardly breathe
Thinking maybe these stupid whiskey dreams
Are going to kill me soon

Tried my best to go out last night
Saw some people, didn't care
Couldn't even try
Thinking darling that you should take me back
Before I loose my mind

Rain rains on everything I need
I keep my head dry
You keep my knees weak

I feel so tired
I need to rest my head
Can't close my eyes so I give up and crawl out of bed
Thinking maybe you already know the truth
I'd never do

Rub my eyes, splash the water cold
See my wiry face so lonely sick and old
Thinking darling that, you should take me back
Before I loose my mind

Rain rains on everything I need
I keep my head dry
You leave my knees weak

So I'm done, I can't breathe anymore
I lie awake and burning cold on the kitchen floor
Now I swear that I, I will never try
To trust a bitch again
