Hey, I'm looking up for my star girl
I guess I'm stuck in this mad world
The things that I wanna say
But you're a million miles away
And I was afraid when you kissed me
On your intergalactical frisbee
I wonder why, I wonder why
You never asked me to stay

(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
So wouldn't you like to come with me?
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Whoa, your gravity's makin' me dizzy
Girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
Make a little love in the moonlight

Hey, there's nothing on earth that can save us
When I find love with Uranus
I don't want to give you away
Because it makes no sense at all
And Houston, we've got a problem
The ground control couldn't stop them
I wonder why, I wonder why
You never asked me to stay

(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
So wouldn't you like to come with me?
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Whoa, your gravity's makin' me dizzy
Girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
Make a little love in the moonlight

Fly away
Watch the night turn into day
Dance on the Milky Way
Melt me with your eyes
My star girl, rules the skies

One! two! one, two, three, four!

I'm looking up for my star girl
I guess I'm stuck in this mad mad world
The things that I wanna say
But you're a million miles away

(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
So wouldn't you like to come with me?
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
Yeah, wouldn't you like to come with me?
Yeah, girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
I can't get enough of you
Galaxy defenders, stay forever
Never get enough of yooou, oooou, oooou
