Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks

Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Let's go
Woke up Mexico
Tan lines
Here we go
Gin fizz
In my glass

Shake shake
Shake shake the shack
We meet all the cats
New scene fade to black
Bop bop bop bop bop
Bop bop bop bop bop
Milkshakes on the rack

Just dancing in the street
Hands up holler back
And come on dance with me
Hot hands on your hips
And work it baby please
One kiss on the lips
It's summer by the sea
By the sea

By the sea

Wake up

It's time to blend
Everything

Throw the juices in
Mix it up till it's bubbling

Now your tripping of the good?
Get you rocking like an animal

Always ready baby
Locked and loaded
Bop bop bop bop bop
Bop bop bop bop bop
Milkshakes on the rack
Just dancing in the street
Hands up holler back
And c'mon dance with me
Hot hands on your hips
And work it baby please
One kiss on the lips
It's summer by the sea
By the sea
By the sea
