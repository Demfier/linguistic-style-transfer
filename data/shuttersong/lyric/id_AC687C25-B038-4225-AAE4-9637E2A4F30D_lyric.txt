Nobody wants to be the only one left standing
Nobody wants to be the only one to understand
And now I see the way that you're leaving
Without me

Now grow up and drift away
No toy can hold you out
Go call it up
The sound goes…
Open hands are hard to hold on to anyway
Anyway

Anybody wants to make the one live forever
And nobody wants to be the only one who feels the pain
And now I see the way that you're leaving
Without me

Now grow up and drift away
No toy can hold you out
Go call it up
The sound goes…
Open hands are hard to hold on to anyway
Anyway, anyway, anyway

Now grow up and drift away
No toy can hold you out
Go call it up
The sound goes…
Open hands are hard to hold on to anywhere
Anyway, open hands are hard to hold on to anyway
Anyway, open hands are hard to hold on to anyway
Anyway, anyway, anyway
