Silent night, holy night

All is calm, all is bright

Round you virgin mother and child

Holy infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace

Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night

Son of God, love¡¯s pure light

Radiant beams from thy holy face

With the dawn of redeeming grace

Christ, the Savior is born

Christ, the Savior is born

Christ, the Savior is born
