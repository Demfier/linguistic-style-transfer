Come
Come one, come all
You must be this tall
To ride this ride
At the carnival
Oh come take my hand
And run through playland
So high, too high
At the carnival
And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket and there's no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go
Will I catch up to love, I can never tell
I know

Chasing after you is like a fairy tale
But I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

This horse is too slow
We're always this close
Almost, almost
We're a freak show
Ride right when I'm near
It's like you disappear
Where'd you go?

Mister Houdini you're a freak show
And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket and there's no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go
Will I catch up to love, I can never tell
I know

Chasing after you is like a fairy tale
But I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Why did you steal my
cotton candy heart
You threw it in this damn
coin slot
And now I'm stuck, I'm stuck
Riding
Riding

Riding
Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go
Will I catch up to love, I can never tell
I know
Chasing after you is like a fairy tale
But I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel.
