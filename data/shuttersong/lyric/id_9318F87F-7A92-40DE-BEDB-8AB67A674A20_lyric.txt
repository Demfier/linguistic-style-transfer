Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Round yon virgin mother and child

Holy infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace
Radiant beams from thy holy face

Sleep in heavenly peace

With the dawn of redeeming grace

Christ, the Savior is born

 
Silent night, holy night

Hooh,Christ, the Savior is born

Son of God, love's pure light

Radiant beams from thy holy face

With the dawn of redeeming grace

Christ, the Savior is born

Hooh,Christ, the Savior is born

Sleep in heavenly peace
