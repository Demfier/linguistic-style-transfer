Lately I got this feeling
I dont know whats the meaning
But I know its strong and its over you
All I want is to be home with you

Oh oh I'm coming right back
Oh oh Livin without you is no no
I'm coming right back
Oh oh woahh

I wish you were here
Yeah, I wish you were here
Music is better
And lights are brighter when you are near
Am I making it clear?
The music is better

And right now I just wish you were here

Oh oh, oh oh oh Right now I just wish you were here

Oh oh, oh oh oh Right now I just wish you were here
At night, a different city
Bright lights should be pretty

All I want right now is to be home with you

Oh oh I'm coming right back
Oh oh Livin without you is no no
I'm coming right back
Oh oh woahh

I wish you were here
Yeah, I wish you were here
Music is better
And lights are brighter when you are near
Am I making it clear?
The music is better
And right now I just wish you were here
Oh oh, oh oh oh Right now I just wish you were here
Oh oh, oh oh oh Right now I just wish you were here
Oh oh, oh oh oh Right now I just wish you were here

And Im waitin, so hurry back

You better follow the path
Car, bus, train, go and get a cab
Or just fly here, jet pack

I was a puzzle piece, but you solved me
Our future, I see it so clear
And right nowâ€¦
