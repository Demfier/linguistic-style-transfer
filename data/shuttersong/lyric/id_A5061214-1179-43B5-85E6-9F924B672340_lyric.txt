Dangerous
I should've known I would pay for this
You look to good with your makeup off
And your favorite song
They get scared to lust
Girl, you're dangerous

The checking, the fucking, the lying
The options, there's so many options
The ladder you gotta be climbing
You always just check on your status

Girl, what's been happening lately?
We don't even talk no more
I be getting high on the low
All the guys on your phone
Lately [?] gone cold
I see it in your eyes
In your tone, I can hear it
Sky was the limit
Spoke about the future, I wasn't in it
Said you had plans for a man and a Bentley
But you should've been here when your boy was in the Civic

Dangerous
I should've known I would pay for this
You look to good with your makeup off
And your favorite song
They get scared to lust
Girl, you're dangerous

[Kid Ink:]
Kid Ink, that bad girl so dangers
Say she from Los Angeles
Never seen her on my side of town
No Instagram, she famous though
Was around when we first came in here
Pull the chains out and that changes stuff
She a dim but ain't no changing her
She need a sugar daddy and my cane is up
I swear if you walk right by me
It's gon' be hard for you to say bye to me
The bottles is bottomless
I'm buying everything my finger land on like Monopoly
But you ain't nobody's property
And you wanna [?]
How so?
Show me what it's worth, boo
So bad
In other words, you

The streets in the summer, I love 'em
The winter gets cold, you need someone
Cause every night can't be a function
But that's just the way you dysfunction
