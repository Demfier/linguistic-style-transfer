Jane Doe.
I don't think know you
But I know fo' sho'.
That you are beautiful
So baby let me know
Your name.

Damn what's her name?
Cause I'm overly attracted
And terribly convinced that she could be my princess
And I could be her prince.
And I felt that way, since
Since I saw Jane Doe.

Jane Doe.
I don't even know you
But I know fo' sho'.
That I could get to know ya.
If you let me know
Your name.

Damn what's her name?
Cause I'm overly attracted
And terribly convinced that she could be my princess
And I could be her prince.

And I felt that way, since
Since I saw Jane Doe.

She's everything I want and more.
She's everything I want for sure.
She's everything that I want to adore
Well baby I am overly attracted
And terribly convinced that she could be my lover
But I think I lost my chance.
You had me at first glance
Oh my Jane Doe.
