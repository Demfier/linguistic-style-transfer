How many men would pay to get your loving.
Just shut the door and light your flame.
You're my kind of play game.

You're my kind of bad.
Blazing till the sun.
Comes up again.

(2х)
Cause tonight you're mine.
You do it just fine.
You make it a blast.
Tonight.
You don't know my name.
Just do your wild game.
Girl, I need it fast.
Tonight.

I'll face the music in the daylight.
But now - no strings, no talk, no fame.
You're my kind of downfall.
You're my off-the-wall….love... me now.
But then - then forget it all.
