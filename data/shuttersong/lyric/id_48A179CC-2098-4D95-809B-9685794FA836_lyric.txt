Oklahoma Christmas (feat. Reba Mcentire)
Lets have an oh-oh-ohklahoma Christmas
We'll have an old-fashioned two-steppin' time around our ol' tree
We'll have an oh-oh-ohklahoma Christmas
Even if we have to have it here in Tennessee
Power Lines are down all over town 40 Westbound is a sheet of ice
Heard the weatherman say more is on the way, guess we ain't goin' anywhere tonight
Oh so call up granny and tell her the news
But if it's only me and you
We' oh-oh-ohklahoma Christmas
Let's have an old-fashioned two stepping' time round our little old tree
We'll have an oh-oh-ohklahoma ChristmasHey,
even if we have to have it here in Tennessee
It don't seem right if we don't have a big slice of
Aunt Bea's pecan pie on our plate
But we can make do, hey I'll whip up two golden brown chicken fried steaks
So put on some Bob Wills to set the mood
I think I've even have a six pack of 3.2.
