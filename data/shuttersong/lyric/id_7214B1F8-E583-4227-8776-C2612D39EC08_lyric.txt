I remember when we broke up the first time
You're saying this is it, I've had enough
I'm just like We haven't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space, what?

But when you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oooh we called it off again last night
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like ever...

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights at me
Falling for a screaming that I'm right
And you hide away and find your piece of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oooh you called me up again tonight
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever ever ever
And I used to say never say never
Huh, he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like, I mean, I mean this is exhausting, you know
Like we are never getting back together, like ever

We are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Not getting back together, we
Oh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
