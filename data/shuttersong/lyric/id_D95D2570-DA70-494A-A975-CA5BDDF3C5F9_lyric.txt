Kickin' it in my
Kickin' it in my
Kickin' it in my J's (J's)
Kickin' it in my J's
(whoop, 1, 2, 3, 4)

(whoop)
What's real?
'Cause everybody knows the deal
Everyone says that they grindin'
But I mean that ain't for real
'Cause I never asked for nothin'
And I did it all my, my, my
All (all) I care about is music
And the city that I come from

But I still take all the time
To thank all my believa's
Y'all gave me a chance
To turn me up in your speakers

And all these other rappers
Who I consider my teachers
Give'em a couple years
And they all be askin' for features

Livin' my life
Travel by night
Never thought I would
Be living this nice
When I say hey
Girlies go cray
Must be the reason they screamin' my name
My (my) fans say I'm #1
When I'm kickin' it in my J's
They keep jumpin'
I'm criss crossin' as soon as I hit the stage
(stage, stage, stage)
(whoop)

Kick-kickin' it in my J's
Kick-kickin' it in my J's
My fans say I'm #1
When I'm kickin' it in my J's
Kick-kickin' it in my J's
Kickin' it in my J's
My (my) fans say I'm #1
When I'm kickin' it in my J's
(whoop)

Kickin' it in my Kickin' it in my J's (J's-whoop whoop whoop) Now I'm countin' two
hundred
Milli's billi's go straight to the bank
I'm (I'm) countin' two hundred models
So wow I'm pimpin' today
In the back of the DeLorean
With [?]
On my Ralph Lauren
And I got all these girls on me man

It must be my Jordans
But else livin' my life
Travel by night
Never thought I would
Be living this nice
When I say hey
Girlies go cray
Must be the reason they screamin' my name
My (my) fans say I'm #1
When I'm kickin' it in my J's
They keep jumpin'
I'm criss crossin' as soon as I hit the stage

(whoop whoop)
Kick-kickin' it in my J's
Kick-kickin' it in my J's
My fans say I'm #1
When I'm kickin' it in my J's
Kick-kickin' it in my J's
Kickin' it in my J's
My (my) fans say I'm #1
