As a kid they told me love was made up
But I used to tell them they were wrong
'Cause the blue-eyed girl that made me wake up
Is still right behind me in this song
Stood they counted every heartbeat
Thinking about the words to say
Try not to understand our feeling
Would it ever go away

Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
I'm in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me
Next to me

Next to me
Next to me

You told me we would be forever
But maybe we were just too young
I wonder if you still remember
When we were dancing in the sun

Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
I'm in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me
Next to me
Next to me
