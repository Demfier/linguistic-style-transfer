My Everything - Ariana Grande
I've cried enough tears to see
My own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny
I really missed him
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know
What you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
And saying sorry for the sake of us
He wasn't my everything
'Til we were nothing
And it's taken me a lot to say
And now that he's gone 
My heart is missing something
So it's time to push our pride away
'Cause you are  you are 
You are my everything
You are  you are 
You are my everything
I know you're not far
But I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I gope this is a temporary feeling
Cause it's too much to bare
Without you
And I know sorry ain't the cyre
So if I cross your mind
Just know I'm yours
What we got is worth fighting for
Cause you are
You are my everything
Til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone 
My heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are  you are
You are my everything
You are  you are
You are my everything
You are  you are 
You are
You are  you are 
You are
My everything
