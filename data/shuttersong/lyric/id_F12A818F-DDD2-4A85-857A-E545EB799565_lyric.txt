April Showers - ProleteR
March winds and April showers
Make way for sweet May flowers
And then from June  a moon and you
March winds and April showers
Romance will soon be ours
And I'll go paradise for two
March winds and April showers
Make way for sweet May flowers
And then from June  a moon and you
March winds and April showers
Make way for happy colors
Then May time  June time  love time and you
March winds and April showers
Make way for sweet May flowers
And then from June  a moon and you
March winds and April showers
Romance will soon be ours
And I'll go paradise for two
