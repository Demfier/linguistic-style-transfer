Where Are You Now -  Justin Bieber
Ohhh   a
Ohhh woah   
Ohhh   
Where are you now 
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand 
I wanna be close
Help me when I am down' lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong   
So' take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free
Yeah' yeah
Where are you now 
Where are you now 
Now tat I'm half grown
Why are we far apart 
I feel so alone
Where are you now 
When nothing's going right
Where are you now 
I can't see the light
So' take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free
Yeah    yeah
I need you' to need me
Can't you stay with me 
How could you leave me 
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole when you're not with me
I want you here with me
To guide me' hold me and love me now
Where are you now
Hoh    where are you now
Mmmmm   
So' take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free
Yeah' yeah
Ohhh    where are you now
Oh 
Yeah' yeah' oh ohhh    ' yeah
