Is your shallow love for real?

Everywhere I go, I see love turnin' into somethin' it's not
People caught up with the image, when's this shit gon' stop?
When he gets down on his knee and that question gets popped
She's like, "Yes, babe!", eyes still locked at the rock
He's got bands, he wants a pretty lady who wants a Mercedes-Benz
So they can both show off to their friends
They're in the whip, they're in the penthouse and they're in the jet to France
Damn, it seems like love's the only thing that they ain't in
Divin' in headfirst into some shallow waters
I'm just touchin' on a subject that I feel is kinda catastrophic
I'm not sayin' every couple with money's got this problem
But in some cases without the label, she'd be straight up robbin'
Takin' vows to the coffin on the wedding day
Ain't no prenupt needed, she convinced him it's true
Perfectly curved, believin' every word that she spews

Blinded by the beauty, can't see through

Is this shallow love?
Or is it something real?
You make it hard to deal
Not knowin' if this is shallow love
The way we live so well
Can make it hard to tell

What she in it for?
What she really in it for?

So girl tell me what you in it for
Is it cause I'm young and livin' like a centerfold?
Is it cause I'm takin' you places that you ain't been before?
By the looks of it this love is too fake, we might as well just call the dentist yo
Can you see why I'm trippin' though?
Cause man if shit's like this now
Then what's it gon' be like when we get to the pinnacle?
And I suppose only time's gon' tell
But as of now, we're doin' fine, no help
Girl you're a piece of work that God designed so well
But you don't need to check the worth before you ride with me
Put that man aside if he's all about bein' with someone just to get inside
Or he's hopin' and prayin' that you gon' stay when he gets caught
When he slips up, fightin', pullin' all sorts and types of straws
Now the jig's up, left broken in pieces like a jigsaw
¡°
What she really in it for?

But that's just how shit goes
When you let the shallow love get hold
Girl I just wanna know

Is this shallow love?
Or is it something real?
You make it hard to deal
Not knowin' if this is shallow love

The way we live so well
Can make it so hard to tell
What she in it for?
What she really in it for?

Nowadays these girls be so ruthless

2 A.M. knockin' on my front door, who's this?
Girl I don't even know your name
This ain't the time yo
Oh my God this is so insane
Like I ain't even got your number saved in my iPhone

Is this shallow love?

Tell me now (damn)
Now, tell me now
What you in it for, girl?
I don't even fucking know
