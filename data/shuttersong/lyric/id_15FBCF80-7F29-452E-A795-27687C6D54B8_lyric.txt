When you're in my house I start to cry
Take me baby, take me to the other side
Make me shake like you do every time
Only you can keep me satisfied (shwoop)

Why she so possessive?
Texting all day so aggressive
I'm watching her highs and her lows
She seems like she's manic depressive
And I only hit it one time
It's not that intense, why she so obsessive?
The way that she's latched to me out in the club
Cuffing just to be suggestive
Sending a message to other girls out
I question your motives, can't tell what your about
Got this bad feeling this thing won't work out
Should tell you fuck off and get my keys and merc out
Just curve you and leave
Desires at first you deceive
You seem like a angel by virtue of searching to please, but damn
We might suffocate would it hurt you to breathe, fuck

When you're in my house I start to cry
Take me baby, take me to the other side
Make me shake like you do every time
Only you can keep me satisfied

Not with all that clinginess
And I don't need drama, don't bring me this
You're crazy I know what my limit is
So before it gets weirder, I am ending this
I heard you've been telling your friends
You think we've got something, we've got this connection
You thinking I might be the next one
Wonder the fuck what would give you that impression
Now your just pressing to get some attention
When I ignore you, then you try to threaten
Cause you'll tell my girl cause you know it's a weapon
You feed on the drama to fuel your obsession
Fuck I need a whisky but leave it to you
You probably put poison inside it, to kill me
And get off not guilty, your antics are filthy
Know what you want it's just not what it will be

When you're in my house I start to cry
Take me baby, take me to the other side
Make me shake like you do every time
Only you can keep me satisfied

Stay with me forever, don't leave
I'll cry and beg and crawl on my hands and knees
You can lock me in the dark throw away the key
For now I'll share, but soon you will be on to me
Belong to me, soon you'll will belong to me
Belong to me, soon you'll will be belong to me
I'll lock you in the dark and throw away the key
For now I'll share, but soon you'll belong to me

Why are you acting so possessive
Calling all day that's way to aggressive
I can't belong to you
Bitch you got me fucked up
I can't take you to the other side
