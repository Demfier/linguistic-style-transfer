Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit

Feeling lit, feeling light, 2 am summer night

I don't care, hand on the wheel, driving drunk, I'm doing my thing

Rolling the mid-west side and out, living my life, getting¡¯ out dreams

I'ma do just what I want looking ahead no turning back

People told me slow my roll I'm screaming out, fuck that

I'm screaming out fuck that

I'm screaming out fuck that

Fuck that

Fuck that

Fuck that

Fuck that

Tell me what you know about dreaming dreaming

You don't really know about nothing nothing

Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night

5 am, cold sweats waking up, to the sky

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

Hey, I'll be fine once I get it (get it .....)

Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams

Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothing

You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow

Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good....
