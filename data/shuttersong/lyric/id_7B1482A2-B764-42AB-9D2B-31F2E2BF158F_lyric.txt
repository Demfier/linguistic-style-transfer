I am lost
in our rainbow
now our rainbow
has gone

Overcast
by your shadow
as our worlds move on

In this shirt
I can be you
to be near you
for a while

In this shirt
I can be you
to be near you
for a while

There's a crane
knocking down
all those things
that we were

lie awake
in the night
to hear the engines purr

There's a pain
it does ripple
through my frame
makes me lame

There's a thorn
in my side
it's the shame
it's the pride

Of you and me
ever changing
moving on now
moving fast

And his touch
must be wanted
must become
through your ask

But I need
Jake to tell you
that I love you
it never rests

And I've bled
every day now
for a year
for a year

I did send
you a note
on the wind
for to read

Our names
there together
must have fallen
like a seed

To the depths
of the soil
buried deep
in the ground
On the wind
I could hear you
call my name
held the sounds
I am lost
I am lost
in our rainbow
now our rainbow
has gone
I am lost
in our rainbow
now our rainbow
has gone
I am lost
