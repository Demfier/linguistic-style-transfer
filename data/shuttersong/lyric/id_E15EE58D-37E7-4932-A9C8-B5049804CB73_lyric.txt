Feeling used
But I'm still missing you
And I can't see the end of this
Just want to feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I hate you
I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to
But I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you
I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too
And I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you
You wouldn't like that sit
I put this reel out
But you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings
But you never mind that shit
Oh, oh
Still in love with me
But your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings
Are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you got to burn some bridges
Just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts
And I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad
Love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night
I sing this song
I hate you
I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to
But I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you
I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
