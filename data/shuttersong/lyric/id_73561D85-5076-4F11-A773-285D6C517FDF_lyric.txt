If you ever leave me baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have we don¡¯t have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
So don't even mind all the sacrifices I'll make it
To keep you by my side and keep from walkin' out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away' everyday it will rain' rain' rain
I'll never be your mother's favourite
Your daddy can¡¯t even look me in the eye
If I was in their shoes I would be doin' the same thing
Sayin'' ¡°There goes my little girl' walking with that troublesome guy¡±
But they¡¯re just afraid of something they can¡¯t understand
But little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleedin'
If that would make it right
'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you baby
And just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away' everyday it will rain' rain' rain
Don't just say Goodbye
Don't just say Goodbye
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleedin'
And that would make it right
'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you baby
And just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away' everyday it will rain' rain' rain
