So Long (So Long)
So Long
So Long (So Long)
So Long

See it in your eyes (There's been a change)
I feel distant
There's been a change
A fear
Hangs over my head
I search for peace
In the midst of it all
What we had
In those old photographs
So far gone
I gotta move on

So Long (So Long)
So Long (So Long)
See it in your eyes (There's been a change)
I feel distance
There's been a change
A fear whoa-oh-whoa
Hangs from my head
Is so far gone
I gotta move on

So Long (So Long)
So Long
So Long (So Long)
So Long
See it in your eye (There's been a change)
I feel distant
There's been a change
There
