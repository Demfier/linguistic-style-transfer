Made some money, and yea I spend it real quick
Got some dope kicks, now I'm fuckin' broke again
Took my girls car, then I totaled it
Then she caught me hookin' up with some older chick
Baby I love you, it's just hard to notice it
Hidin affair with the kid, then snare and a kick
Called me embarrassing and heartless
Told me to pack my shit and start walkin'
And that's just what I did, and to you, this song is dedicated

You always said that I'd never amount to nothing
But I'm something now, that your not apart of
But you still got the keys to my heart

She's an expert on breaking my heart
She took, me apart, part for part
She look, she looked the part, good lookin' and smart
She's a crook and she took me for all that I got
I got shot, dead in the head by cupid
Damn why I got to be so stupid
Love don't cost a thing, money's useless
Honeys gone do her thing so let her do it
And that's just what I did, and to you, this song is dedicated

You always said that I'd never amount to nothing
But I'm something now, that your not apart of
You always said me and my friends were frontin'
Were something now, your not apart of
You still got the keys to my heart love

You got the keys to my car
You got the keys to my house
You got the keys to my heart
You got the keys to my heart
You got the keys to my car
You got the keys to my house
You got the keys to my heart

You always said that I'd never amount to nothing
But I'm something now, that your not apart of
You go and say, what you say
Something now
Ohhh Yeaaa
