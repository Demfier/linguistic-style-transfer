"Lovesick Day"

Keep giving me more
Tell me your story
I wanna know everything
Where you grew up
Songs that you love and all the stuff in between
Where did you get your beautiful hair
And the scar above your knee
I wanna know everything, everything

The sun is sneaking in through the camellias
Hear me out 'cause I've got an idea

Let's take a lovesick day
We'll keep the world away
Nowhere I want to be but here with you
Let's take a lovesick day
Ditch all your plans and say, "Let's stay here together."
It's so much better when it's me and you, you, you,
Let's call it a lovesick day

As soon as you wake I'll make you pancakes
Let's start where we left off
When your hand's in mine it feels so right
I've been waiting for so long
I'll turn off my phone, pretend I'm not home
I just wanna get lost
We can do anything, anything

Don't you know that I would never leave you
Hear me out 'cause I've got an idea

Let's take a lovesick day
We'll keep the world away
Nowhere I want to be but here with you
Let's take a lovesick day
Ditch all your plans and say, "Let's stay here together."
It's so much better when it's me and you, you, you,
Let's call it a lovesick day

I don't care about the million things I gotta do
Come here, everything we need is in this room
And all I want is you

Let's take a lovesick day
We'll keep the world away
Nowhere I want to be but here with you
Let's take a lovesick day
Ditch all your plans and say, "Let's stay here together."
It's so much better when it's me and you, you, you,
Let's call it a lovesick day
