Champagne For My Real Friends  Real Pain For My Sham Friends\n You are a getaway car- a rush of blood to the head\n But me  I'm just the covers on top of your bed\n You steer away in a rear view mirror\n You make my head swim\n I keep you warm and won't ask you where you've been\n With your backless black dress soaked to the skin\n When it's said and down they're all scrambling\n And we're friends  yeah we're friends\n Just because we move units\n Strike us like matches \n Cause everyone deserves the flames\n We only do it for the scars and stories  not the fame\n At least everyone else is trying \n Everyone else is shining\n Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame\n Such a shame\n The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt\n Oh yeah  you caught me  But I caught you way worse\n They say  "You want a war  You've got a war "\n But who are you fighting for \n The tides out  the ship's run aground\n We drown traitors in shallow water\n With your backless black dress soaked to the skin\n When it's said and down they're all scrambling\n And we're friends  yeah we're friends\n Just because we move units\n Strike us like matches \n Cause everyone deserves the flames\n We only do it for the scars and stories  not the fame\n At least everyone else is trying \n Everyone else is shining\n Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame\n Such a shame\n Everyone else is trying \n Everyone else is shining\n Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame\n Such a shame\n Strike us like matches \n Cause everyone deserves the flames\n We only do it for the scars and stories  not the fame\n At least everyone else is trying \n Everyone else is shining\n Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
