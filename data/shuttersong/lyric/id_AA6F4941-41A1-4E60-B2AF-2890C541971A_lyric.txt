Drake - Take care\n Lyrics By£ºæ¼÷ì\n  \n Know you¡¯ve been hurt by someone else\n I can tell by the way you carry yourself\n If you let me  here¡¯s what I¡¯ll do\n I¡¯ll take care of you\n I¡¯ve loved and I¡¯ve lost\n I¡¯ve asked about you and they¡¯ve told me things\n But my mind didn¡¯t change\n I still the feel the same\n A life with no fun  please don¡¯t be so ashamed\n I¡¯ve had mine  you¡¯ve had yours we both know\n We know  they don¡¯t get you like I will\n My only wish is I die real\n Cause that truth hurts  and those lies heal\n And you can¡¯t sleep thinking that he lies still\n So you cry still  tears all in the pillow case\n Big girls all get a little taste\n Pushing me away so I give her space\n Feeling with a heart that I didn¡¯t break\n I¡¯ll be there for you  I will care for you\n I keep thanking you  just don¡¯t know\n Try to run from that  say you¡¯re done with that\n On your face girl  it just don¡¯t show\n When you¡¯re ready  just say you¡¯re ready\n When all the baggage just ain¡¯t as heavy\n And the parties over  just don¡¯t forget me\n We¡¯ll change the pace and just go slow\n Won¡¯t ever have to worry \n You won¡¯t ever have to hide\n If you seen all my mistakes\n So look me in my eyes\n Cause if you let me  here¡¯s what I¡¯ll do\n I¡¯ll take care of you\n I¡¯ve loved and I¡¯ve lost\n It¡¯s my birthday  I get high if I want to\n Can¡¯t deny that I want to  but I lie if have to\n Cause you don¡¯t say you love me\n To your friend when they ask you\n Even though we both know that you do (you do)\n One time  been in love one time\n You and all your girls in the club one time\n All so convinced that you¡¯re following your heart\n Cause your mind don¡¯t control what it does sometimes\n We all have our nights though  don¡¯t be so ashamed\n I¡¯ve had mine  you¡¯ve had yours  we both know\n We know  You hate being alone\n You ain¡¯t the only one\n You hate the fact that you bought the dream\n And they sold you one\n You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin¡¯ to save you\n Know you¡¯ve been hurt by someone else\n I can tell by the way you carry yourself\n If you let me  here¡¯s what I¡¯ll do\n I¡¯ll take care of you\n I¡¯ve loved and I¡¯ve lost
