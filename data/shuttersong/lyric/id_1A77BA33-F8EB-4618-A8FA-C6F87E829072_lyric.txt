 You don't even need the makeup
Save that shit for later
 You  the baddest thing I seen I'm thanking your creator
Girl, I see  you working like Miley Cyrus be twerking
I'm certain  you'll be screaming for me when I close  the curtains
But it's funny, 'cause I'm  the one screaming now for  you, baby
I been messing around with too many girls, I  need a lady
Hoping  you can be  the one but  you  need to show it
And if  you prove it to me, all this money, girl, we'll blow it
I ain't never met a girl, like  you
And  you'll never find a man, like me
Walking out  the door, with  you on my arm
 You can hit me on my phone anytime  you want
Got me going mad, when  you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap when  you act like that
I ain't  even mad when  you dress like that
I know  you know  you bad (OK) when  you act like that (hah) (get it)
Walked up in  the spot, we  do this a lot
Living at  the top, attention  you caught mine
Let's pop a bottle, good God
Look at what we got
Double take like a stop sign
I thought I would be done with all of this stuff
But shit, I guess  not (I thought I'd be done)
I'm tryin' to get at  you
Trust me I'm  not your average individual
Yeah, I can slow it down
But I ain't talking about verses
I know what  you're worth
And my head I've already bought  you a purse and much more
And I got everything  you  need just like  the drugstore
Oh, and before  you ask
Keeping haters off of my nuts, yeah that's what they come for
A bunch more
Chances are comin' your way, but I know that  you'll take me
(It's crazy)
How people get lust and love mixed up
I'm beginning to daydream
Of what we could be and  the things we could  do if  you give me your time
But tonight, all that's on my mind
Is gettin' to know  you and making  you mine
 You're a dime, girl
A straight ten
Like holy moly, me oh my
I  don 't  even know where to begin
And let's pretend that in this moment in time we're more than friends,
And I recommend that  you and I get familiar
I ain't never met a girl, like  you
And  you'll never find a man, like me
Walking out  the door, with  you on my arm
 You can hit me on my phone anytime  you want
