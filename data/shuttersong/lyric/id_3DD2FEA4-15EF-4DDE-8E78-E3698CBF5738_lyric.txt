Walkin' in, we causin' a frenzy
Walkin' in, we causin' a...
Knock 'em all out, beat 'em like Rousey
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a
Rollin' so deep, but we ain't thirsty
Rollin' so deep, but we ain't
Talkin' trash, we keepin' it classy
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a

Oh when the lights go out and it all goes down
No one even knows when tomorrow comes
Cause we live for now, you and I

And we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh and we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars...

Workin' all week got me all crazy
Workin' all week got me all...
Dancin' dirty, get a little sleazy
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a
Get 'em hyped up, get 'em all talking
Get 'em hyped up, get 'em all...
Looking at you, feelin' so fancy
We don't give a, we don't, we don't give a

Oh when the lights go out and it all goes down
No one even knows when tomorrow comes
Cause we live for now, you and I
And we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh and we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars...

We're the only ones who can fight the Sun
We're forever young and we just begun
We're the only ones who can fight the Sun
We're forever young and we live for now
You and I

And we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we really don't need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh and we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah, we don't really need the light
Cause we're stars...
