[Hook: Quavo]
Finess ha, finess ha
Finess ha, finess ha
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finess ha, finess ha
Finess ha, finess ha
This is my life
This is my life (finess, finess, finess)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec
When I went to the jeweler didn't know what I wanted
And I told him as long as my diamonds are wet
I am a blessing and you are a curse
I only finesse the plug with words
Placed the order, I ordered the birds
He put him in car then a young nigga scurrr
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walkin round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, ballin like a net
And I got a extra plug, no Jeremy Lin
Let the top back, let your hair blow in the wind
Finesse the plug, I don¡¯t need a Benjamin
Judge out of trial say no innocence
Smoking on gas blunts Longer than incense

[Verse 2: Offset]
Juug, Finesse, Steal
I gotta have a mill, I was raised on the hill like Jack and the Jill
Do anything just to pay them bills
My brother caught 15 waitin for the pill
When a nigga broke he comin at yo throat
Tryna sell da coke but it really insult
My lil nigga Chi got smoke
Hungry for the money, tryna get the dough
Shit get real, nigga tried to kill
All this bullshit for a dollar bill
Hoes set you up, they don¡¯t give a fuck
Tryna get ya bucks, watch who you fuck
Plug¡¯s like a socket, gotta keep the rocket
Tryna get a profit, running to that money like sonic
All my cars robotic
No Master P, but "I'm Bout It" gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Finessin and flexin like Wrestlers
Indian plug in that castle
Bald headed jag got cancer
Turn yo main bitch to a dirty dancer
I¡¯m cookin and wrappin them chickens
Finessin these niggas on tickets
If I fuck with ya, I¡¯mma give you a straight draw
Nigga if I don't then I gotta remix it (remix)
Flipping them Patties like crabbies
My shoes importers are ballys
Finessin since I can remember
My wrist so cold, December
I¡¯m selling T-bones they tender
That steel wrapped around me like bender
Difference between me and you
I'm Real and You a pretender (you fake)
