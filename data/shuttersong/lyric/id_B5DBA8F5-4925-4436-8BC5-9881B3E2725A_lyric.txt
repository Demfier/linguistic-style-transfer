"Sleepwalk"
(originally by Santo & Johnny)

Sleepwalk, instead of dreaming I sleepwalk,
Cause I lost you and now what am I to do,
Can't believe that we're through

Sleep talk, cause I miss you I sleep talk,
While the memories of you wither like a soul,
Darling I was so low

The night fills me only blame, I see your face,
Tears through my brain,
I know I miss you so, I still love you,
Drives me insane

Sleepwalk, every night I just sleepwalk,
Please come back and when you walk inside the door
I will sleepwalk no more.
