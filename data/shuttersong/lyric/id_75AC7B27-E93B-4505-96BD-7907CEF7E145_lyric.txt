Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going to leave you?

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

Tell me about Ray and his girl
Do I know Ray is going to meet you?
Love you, I do; stay here, I won't
As stars fade from your eyes

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

1, 2 make it fun
Don't trust anyone
1, 2 make it fun
Don't trust anyone

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

Want to make it fun
Don't trust anyone
Want to make it fun
Don't trust anyone
