Where the hood where the hood where the hood at
Have that nigga in the cut where the wood at
Oh them niggaz actin up !Where the wolves at
You better BUST THAT if you gon pull that
Man cats don't know what it's gonna be
Fuckin with a nigga like me D-to-the-M-to-the-X
Last I heard y'all niggaz was havin sex with the SAME sex
I show no love to homo thugs
Empty out reloaded and throw more slugs
How you gonna explain fuckin a man
Even if we squashed the beef I ain't touchin ya hand
I don't buck with chumps for those to been to jail
That's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I don't fuck with niggaz that think they broads
Only know how to be ONE WAY that's the dog
I know how to get down know how to BITE
Bark very little but I know HOW TO FIGHT
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree
Man I give y'all niggaz the b'iness for fuching wit me is you crazy
Once a song I come though guns is drawn
BLAM BLAM lungs are gone sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street passed midnight look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats cuz
I ain't got nothin to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love em please pray for these cats
Cuz I know niggaz is hardheaded but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin no patience turn into more patience
More trips to ICU cuz I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at(RIGHT HERE) See them niggaz(RIGHT WHERE ! )
GET EM BOY! (RIGHT THERE) That's how we do (AIIGHT THEN)
This is for my dogs this is for my dogs
YO WHERE WE AT BABY !(CREEPIN THROUGH THE FOG)
