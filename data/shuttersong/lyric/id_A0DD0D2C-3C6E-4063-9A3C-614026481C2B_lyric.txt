This is for my instagram models
Eatin' up the cake, watch it go right to your bottom
You should get a new job, holla at McDonalds
Listen when I speak, baby you could write a novel
The way I spit flows put you in a pickle, cause I did it with no label
Got a crystal ball? cause I already got them quesos
It's simple, treat ‘em like Kinkos cause they only tryin' to copy me
Last I checked you ain't some handsome devil with a college degree
But you think you can have your cake and eat it too
Well tell me why these pretty women never leave with you
I even ask your mom and pops and they like, "we approve"
That's why your girlfriend screaming out my name, I call that Beetlejuice
Cause I'm the one she choosing as her preference
Minnesota women show me love like I was Kevin
Pull up in your city I could swear that's no exception
Get up in my X-Box cause I'm all kinect'd

I know some people out there used to hate
Twenty women in my trailer like I'm moving weight
Yeah, no wonder why we celebrate
Hold up, you ain't invited homie you can bake a cake, cake, cake...
Homie you can bake a cake, cake, cake...

They wanna talk but I don't wanna conversate
Watch these women serve the pussy like it's on a plate
Gordon Ramsey though, watch me grab a fancy ho
Just because we eating that don't mean that we be on a date
Plus I'm more Seth Cohen than you've ever been
That's why I take all these women down like medicine
You be popping pills just to get some extra thrills
I said hell no to my lawyer you can throw out all my deals
I'm like Ving Rhames when I bring game
Put a bunch of cash under the table
And cop me a big name with a big house
And a show on basic cable
Probably be hosting some comedy roasting, just talking my shit
Cause it's very explosive
They wanna control this like remote controllers
And pull out the guns, better give me a holster, Shwoop!
I'm trying to coast along the coast cop me an Aston
Nah I ain't the son of Christ but I got passion
You offended? Whoops, I ain't even asking
I'm too busy fucking these older women like I'm Ashton... bang

I know some people out there used to hate
Twenty women in my trailer like I'm moving weight
Yeah, no wonder why we celebrate
Hold up, you ain't invited homie you can bake a cake, cake, cake...
Homie you can bake a cake, cake, cake...

I'm Hoodie I'm I'm I'm Hoodie
I'm Hoodie I'm I'm I'm hoodie bitch
I'm Hoodie I'm I'm I'm Hoodie
I'm Hoodie I'm I'm I'm Hoodie bitch
