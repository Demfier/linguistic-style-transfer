I'm hurtin baby, I'm broken down
I need your lovin, lovin I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm somethin weak
You got me beggin beggin, I'm on my knees

I don't wanna be needin your love 
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killin me when you're away (ohh baby)
Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me
I'm right here cause I need little love a little sympathy
Ya you show me good lovin make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me

My broken pieces you pick them up
Don't leave me hangin hangin come give me some
When I'm without ya so insecure
You are the one thing one thing I'm livin for

I don't wanna be needin your love 
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killin me when you're away (ohh baby)
Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me
I'm right here cause I need little love a little sympathy 
Ya you show me good lovin make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar yes please won't you come and pour it down on me

I want that red velvet I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be your man there ain't no other way
Cause girl you're hotter than a southern California bay
I don't wanna play no games you don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit no make up on that's my (sugar)

Sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me
I'm right here cause I need little love a little sympathy 
Ya you show me good lovin make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me
Sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me
I'm right here cause I need little love a little sympathy 
Ya you show me good lovin make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar yes please won't you come and put it down on me
