Day after day i'm more confused
And i look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know thats a game that i'd hate to loose
And i'm feelin' the strain
Ain't it a shame
Oh gimme the beach boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away
Oh gimme the beach boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away
Beginnin to think that i'm waistin' time
I don't understand the things i do
The world outside looks so unkind
And i'm countin' on you
To carry me through
Oh
Gimme the beach boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away
Gimme the beach boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away
And when my mind is free
And no melody can move me
When i'm feelin blue
A guitar's comin' through to sooth me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know i believe in your song
In rythem in rhyme and harmony
You've helped me along
Makin' me strong
Oh
Gimme the beach boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away
Gimme the beach boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away
Ohhh woah woah
