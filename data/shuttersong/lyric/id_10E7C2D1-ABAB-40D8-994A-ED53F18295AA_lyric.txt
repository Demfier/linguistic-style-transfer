Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my love on over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
The Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup
The folks are dancin' and got all shook up!

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear'em play a tango
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
All gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
