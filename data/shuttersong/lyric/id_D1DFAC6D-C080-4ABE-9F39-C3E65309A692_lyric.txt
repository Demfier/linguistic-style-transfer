I don't believe in all your demons anymore
It's hard to see with any reason from before
I lie awake and face these shadows in the night

I see the truth through crimson eyes

Take me home
Take me home where the restless go
Reckless to the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul
Take me home where the restless go
Reckless till the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul
Whoa
Whoa
There's no use trying to save my soul

These angels burn with an eternal sympathy
Don't say a word until you've heard their symphony
I lie awake creating shadows in the night
I see the truth through crimson eyes

Take me home
Take me home where the restless go
Reckless to the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul
Take me home where the restless go
Reckless till the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
There's no use trying to save my soul

Got my cards lined up in a row
Up in flames and away we go
Lost my name but it's etched in stone
Take me home when the cold wind blows
Ain't no grave gonna hold me down
Wide awake so don't make a sound
Ain't no way you can break me down
No one sings, no escaping now

Take me home where the restless go
Reckless to the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul
Take me home where the restless go
Reckless till the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul
Whoa
There's no use trying to save my soul
Whoa
There's no use trying to save my soul
Whoa
There's no use trying to save my soul
Whoa
There's no use trying to save my soul
