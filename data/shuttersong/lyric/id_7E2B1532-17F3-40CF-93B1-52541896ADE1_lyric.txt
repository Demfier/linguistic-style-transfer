They say Rome wasn't built in a day
And you and I wouldn't build it anyway
It only took a second to watch it all fall to dust,

I thought you hung up the moon
And you thought I lit up the room
But the lights turned off, and that was the end of us.

Slam goes the door
Hush goes the phone
Out goes the flame, and I'm standing here alone
Burn goes the drink
Down go the tears
Drip goes the sink, and i'm missing you like hell
Break goes the heart
Wrong goes the right
Good goes the bye.

It's like we pulled a pin out of a grenade
It just didn't go off right away
But man did it go off when it finally did

And everything's suddenly magnified
It's loud and it's quiet at the same time
As the echo of it's all over sets in.

Slam goes the door
Hush goes the phone
Out goes the flame, and I'm standing here alone
Burn goes the drink
Down go the tears
Drip goes the sink, and i'm missing you like hell
Break goes the heart
Wrong goes the right
Good goes the bye.

I can't go back, we can't be friends
And we can't be what we were then (good goes the bye),
You can't be mine, and I can't be yours
Well it's not love anymore,

Slam goes the door
Hush goes the phone
Out goes the flame, and I'm standing here alone
Burn goes the drink
Down go the tears
Drip goes the sink, i'm missing you like hell
Break goes the heart
Wrong goes the rightâ€¦
Good bye
