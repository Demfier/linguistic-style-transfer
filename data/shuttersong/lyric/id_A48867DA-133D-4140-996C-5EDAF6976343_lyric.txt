O' holy night the stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of our dear saviors birth 
Umm. Umm 
Long lay the world, in sin and error pining 
To he appeared and the soul felt His word 
The thrill of hope 
The weary soul rejoices 
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn' 
Oh oh oh fall on your knees 
Oh hear the angels voices 
Oh night (oh night devine) 
O' holy night (oh holy night) 
When christ was born 
Oh oh oh fall on your knees 
O' hear the angels voices 
O' night (oh night devine) 
O' holy night (oh holy night) 
When Christ was born 
Holy night, holy night when Christ was born 
(Born, Christ in the highest) 
Holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night when Christ was born 
(O' holy night, it was a holy night. Yes it was) 
Holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night when Christ was born 
(The savior of the world is born on a holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night) 
Holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night when Christ was born 
(O holy night the angels cried Holy holy) 
Holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night 
(King of Kings, Lord of Lords, on holy night) 
Holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night 
(Holy)
