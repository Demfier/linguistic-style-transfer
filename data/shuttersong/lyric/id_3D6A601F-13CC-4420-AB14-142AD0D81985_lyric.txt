[Amy:]
Hey!
Oh woah [x3]
Maybe I should've known, maybe I should listen
They say he'll never change, he said with me it's different
I tell myself: "He has a good heart, he means well."
And I swear he's trying so hard
[Dani (with background vocals by Cimorelli):]
But the number of times he's let me down, I can't count that high
[Lisa (with background vocals by Cimorelli):]
All my friends say, he's lame,
You could do so much better than him
All my friends say, he lies,
Last week he made you cry
And all his friends say, she's crazy,
Emotional and unstable
All my friends say, just walk away
Hey!
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Christina:]
He always says he's broke, then buys new video games
Whenever we go out, he always asks me to pay
I'm getting tired of his stupid excuses
All his whining and his mood swings
[Lauren (with background vocals by Cimorelli):]
But the number of times he's made me smile, I can't count that high
[Lisa (with background vocals by Cimorelli):]
All my friends say, he's lame,
You could do so much better than him
All my friends say, he lies,
Last week he made you cry
And all his friends say, she's crazy,
Emotional and unstable
All my friends say, just walk away, hey!
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Katherine:]
And all my friends say
[Dani:]
You should leave him, leave him now
[Katherine:]
And all my friends say
He's no good for you, but somehow I don't care
[Lisa (with background vocals by Cimorelli):]
All my friends say, he's lame,
You could do so much better than him
All my friends say, he lies,
Last week he made you cry
And all his friends say, she's crazy,
Emotional and unstable
All my friends say, just walk away
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, hey!
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
