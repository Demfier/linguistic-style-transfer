Shawty pulled up to the club, came down in a drop top, cool like me
She do everything on the low, you don't ever hear her name going around in these streets
You coming down, the type of chick, take three months to lay her down
But what type of nigga do you think I am? Oh yeah!
I play my role, I'm a stay in my lane
Your side nigga, you can keep your main
I keep it real girl, that's part of the game
Baby girl you know you fine
Just hit me on the line when you pull up to the house
And it's going down, we ain't gotta play around
Ah yeah

[Pre-Chorus - Kirko Bangz:]
You say we ain't gotta tell nobody (oh no)
I can keep a secret shh, quiet
Easy as counting one, two, three yeah
Cause you ain't gotta worry bout another nigga knowing you a freak, yeah baby!

[Chorus - Kirko Bangz & Fetty Wap:]
Girl, you ain't gotta worry bout another nigga knowing you a freak bout it, yeah baby!
Long as you wasn't a phony, you know we gon play it back, yeah baby!
Stay with your man and rules, but you know I got you for the weekend, yeah baby!
Zoo Vier and Kirko Bangz, so you know this some G shit, yeah baby!
You ain't gotta worry bout it, worry bout it, worry bout it, worry 'bout it, yeah
You ain't gotta worry bout it, worry bout it, worry bout it, worry 'bout it, yeah
Long as you wasn't a phony, you know we gon play it back
You ain't gotta worry 'bout another nigga knowing you a freak bout it

[Verse 2 - Kirko Bangz:]
So just hop in my ride, I put some tint so they can't see up inside
Baby just tell me what you wanna do, me and you, ah yeah
I can keep it player when you chilling with your nigga I ain't coming through
Just keep it real with me, cause a nigga like me keep it trill with you
And just save my name up in your phonebook girl
As Ebony, Toya, Tisha, your momma, your brother
Your cousin, your nieces, your aunty, your uncle, your neighbor, your preacher, woo

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro - Kirko Bangz & Fetty Wap:]
She do everything on the low, she do everything on the low, wow
You ain't gotta worry bout it, worry bout it, worry bout it, worry bout it, yeah
You ain't gotta worry bout it, worry bout it, worry bout it, worry bout it, yeah
Long as you wasn't a phony, you know we gon play it back yeah baby
You ain't gotta worry bout another nigga knowing you a freak bout it
