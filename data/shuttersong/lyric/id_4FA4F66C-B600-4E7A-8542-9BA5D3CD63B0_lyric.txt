The city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my window sill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
With lights that blind, keep me awake
Hood up, and lace untied
The street fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveler, oh, ooh, ohh
This is now my home, my home
Oh woah
Burning on the back street
Oh woah
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat
Oh woah

And I'm blazing on the street

What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
It fills my needs and keeps me company

When I need it
Voices beat through my walls

I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger
A traveler, oh, ooh, ohh
This is now my home, my home
Oh woah

Burning on the back street
Oh woah
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat

Oh woah
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you

And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head

Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
Oh woah
Burning on the back street
Oh woah
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat
Oh woah
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
