Verse 1:
Come, if you got real love for me
Stay away, if got games and tricks for me

Bridge 1:
I wanna man that means everything he say
And not a boy full of play
Pulling rabbits out of his hat everyday
Oh, Baby I'm scared of you

Chorus:
I? I don't believe in magic (magic)
I believe in love everlasting
I can? t understand that

Verse 2:
Houdini, Houdini, was great magician
He could crack a lock, from any position

Bridge 2:
But my heart, is nothing like those locks
And your falling last of my brand of stock
Like little red riding hood, you? re the fox
Oh baby I'm scared of you

Chorus:
I? I don't believe in magic
I believe (I believe) in love ever lasting

Oh, Oh, Oh. . . (3 x)

Chorus:
I? I don't believe in magic
I believe (I believe) in love ever lasting

Bridge 3:
Don't go pulling no rabbits out your hat
It'll be all I want from that
Baby now I can't go for that

I can't understand that baby (naw naw)
I can't understand that baby

Duet:
W: You ain't no Houdini
M: Ah, I know I ain't

W: I can't understand that baby
M: Oh, Like Rudolph Valentino,
I can fall down on my knees
Pull flowers out my sleeve
Because I know you will be pleased, I wonder

W: I can't understand that baby
I can't understand that
M: Look, I can pull flowers out my hat
Do a disappearing act
Come back on you so strong
Girl I really turn your loving on, I wonder

W: I can't understand that baby
I can't understand that
I need a man
M: I'm available

Don't need a boy full of games and tricks everyday

I can't understand that
