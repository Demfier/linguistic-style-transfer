Whenever I feel indecision
I try to keep it inside
But I keep wondering about the unsaid
Eyes closed you're inside in my head
The fire is lit
I have to get away
Get away no to confess
You would never get it
I have to hide away
Hide away in my own mess

Oh! You've never been alone
You've never been alone no
It's time to let you go
Oh! You've never been alone
You've never been on your own no
It's time to let you go

A to the B, to the A B B
Don't you play these games with me
A to the B, to the A B B
Don't you dare play games with me

Everyday every time I try to forget
But you'll never see me regret
It's all slow and all misled
But who knows if there's some thing there
Every time I try to quit
I try to get away
Get away no to confess
You would never get it
I have to hide away
Hide away in my own mess

(Because)
Oh! You've never been alone
You've never been alone no
It's time to let you go
Oh! You've never been alone
You've never been on your own no
It's time to let you go

(Because)
Oh! You've never been alone
You've never been on your own no
It's time to let you go

It's time to let you go (3)
