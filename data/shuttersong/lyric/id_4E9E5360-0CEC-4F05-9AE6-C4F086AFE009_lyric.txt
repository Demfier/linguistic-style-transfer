I'm a flame, you're a fire
I'm the dark in need of light
When we touch, you inspire
Feel the change in me tonight
Take me up, take me higher
There's a world not far from here
We can dance in desire
Or we can burn in love tonight

Our hearts are like
Firestones
And when they strike
We feel the love
Sparks will fly
They ignite our bones
But when they strike
We light up the world

Our hearts are like
Firestones
And when they strike
We feel the love
Sparks will fly
They ignite our bones
But when they strike
We light up the world
We light up the world

We light up the world

Oh whoa
Whoa
Oh whoa
Firestone

I'm from X
You're from Y
Perfect strangers in the night
Here we are, come together
To the world we'll testify

Our hearts are like
Firestones
And when they strike
We feel the love
Sparks will fly
They ignite our bones
But when they strike
We light up the world

Our hearts are like
Firestones
And when they strike
We feel the love
Sparks will fly
They ignite our bones
But when they strike
We light up the world

We light up the world

We light up the world

Oh whoa
Whoa
Oh whoa
Firestone
