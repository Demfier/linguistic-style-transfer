bulle-e-e-e-e-t
...
had the song picked out
had the preacher on call
had my momma in tears she didn't like him at all
but I loved him
yah i really thought i loved him
thank God i dodged your bulle-e-e-e-t
thank God i didn't do i-i-i-i-t
no empty shells on the ground
and you're no where to be found
cause once the trigger is pulled
it's impossible
to dodge a bullet
no more your dragging your dollar coarsing around on chain(?)
no more knock down, shouting driving me insane
yah i really thought i loved him
now I'm never thinkin' of him
Thank God i dodged a bulle-e-e-e-t
thank God i didn't do i-i-i-i-t
no empty shells on the ground
and you're no where to be found
cause once the trigger is pulled
it's impossible
to dodge a bullet
close call, almost got shot down
thank you for showing me what i don't want
oooh aoooh
i dodged a bullet
i dodged a bulle-e-e-e-t
thank God i didn't do i-i-i-i-t
no empty shells on the ground
and you're no where to be found
i dodged a bulle-e-e-e-t
thank God i didn't do i-i-i-i-t
no empty shells on the ground
and you're no where to be found
