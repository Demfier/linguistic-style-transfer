Safe little house, safe little friends,
Safe little thoughts to keep you safe
From all those big bad wolves that eat you up. (Aww shit)

Safe in your room,
Safe as a tomb,
Sleep in a coffin made of glass.
It takes a big facade to hide the cracks.

Can you make this last?
Cause now I'm not so sure,
Are you up to the task?
Sometimes the sickness is the cure.
You're searching so hard,
You've lost yourself...

Does it help you to pray as you're wasting away
Like a silver screen cliche?
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh)
Will it help you to wait for the moment to break,
Is it real or is it fake?
All we are, just chapters on a page.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh.)
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.

Hearing you now, shedding the doubts
They'll be no past or future tense.
Regrets a waste of time and plans will change.
(Plans will always change)

Oh, some for the worst,
Some for the best,
You know you can't always get your way.
(So selfish)
So worried about what's next,
You lost today.
(Now you lost today)

Can you make this last?
Cause now I'm not so sure,
Are you up to the task?
Sometimes the sickness is the cure.
You're searching so hard,
You've lost yourself...

Does it help you to pray as you're wasting away
Like a silver screen cliche?
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh)
Will it help you to wait for the moment to break,
Is it real or is it fake?
All we are just chapters on a page.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh.)
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.

Can you let yourself,
Can you let yourself,
Will you let yourself,
Will you let yourself let go?
Let go.
Can you let yourself,
Can you let yourself,
Won't you let yourself?
Just let yourself let go.
Let go.

Safe little house, safe little friends,
Safe little thoughts to keep you safe.

Does it help you to pray as you're wasting away
Like a silver screen cliche?
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh)
Will it help you to wait for the moment to break,
Is it real or is it fake?
All we are chapters on a page.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh.)

Does it help you to pray as you faded away,
Like a memory?
Cause all we are just chapters on a page.
And after all, we're actors on a stage.
