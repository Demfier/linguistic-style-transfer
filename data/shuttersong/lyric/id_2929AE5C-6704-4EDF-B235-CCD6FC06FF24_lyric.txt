The cold wind is blowing and the streets are getting dark
I'm writting you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringing Saint John the Divine
I get a little lonely everyday around this time

The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockafella's tree
People window shoppin' on 5th avenue
All I want for Christmas is you

(Tell me) I've got to know
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
(Where do lonely hearts go)
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
(Oh) Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Things are different since you've been here last

Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared
Do you remember sleigh ridin' in the snow

And dancin' all night to 'Baby, Please Come Home'
Todays celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street
(Tell me) I've got to know

Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
(Where do lonely hearts go)
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
(Oh) Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
I'm all grown up but I'm the same you'll see
I'm writing you this letter 'cause I still believe

Dear Santa, I've been good this year
Can't you stay alittle while, with me right here?
(Tell me) I've got to know
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
(Where do lonely hearts go)
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
(Oh) Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
