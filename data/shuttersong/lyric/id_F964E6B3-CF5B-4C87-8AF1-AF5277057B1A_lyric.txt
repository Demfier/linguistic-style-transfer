As a women

When you are broken

You make the choice to stay down or go and

Find something to bring you back

To get you right, get you right on track

Cause I I I I I was chosen

He found me in the perfect moment

Found my lows and made them highs

So much storms he cleared my skies

I don't think I can deny

He makes me feel wanted

Like no one has before

He don't want nothing from it

But to know my loves for sure

I'd hate to be you watching him love me

I'd hate to be you watching him touch me

Now I am blessed to have what I need

Nothing compares he is all I see, yeah

When I loved you, I didn't love me

You were this dark cloud hanging above me

Got all my girls like

"Nami where'd you go? you've begun to slip away

into where no body knows"

Oh I I I I'm doing better

I've brushed myself off, changed the weather

Like it's sunny its so warm

And for once I feel adored

Oh I could not ask for more

He makes me feel wanted

Like no one has before

He don't want nothing from it

But to know my loves for sure

I'd hate to be you watching him love me

I'd hate to be you watching him touch me

Now I am blessed to have what I need

Nothing compares he is all I see, yeah
