Wild like wild life

Yeah, no telling what I might do
When I'm in the right mood
You know me, I'm all up in the party like a V.I.P.
And everything is looking better from my P.O.V.
Nocturnal animals, we don't sleep
And I'll probably forget you, Cee Lo Green (Cee Lo)
I'm sweating like the Amazon, a hundred degrees
And that back side's bigger than a family tree
So drop that thing like a fumble
Now you're talking to the king of the jungle
We got lions, tigers, bears, oh my
And every single one's turned up, yo
I don't want anybody bringing the vibes down
So if you want to wind down, oh look what I found
A little something that will keep you awake until the break of dawn
Don't be afraid to get rowdy

I'm not done yet, pass me the bottle
It's two AM, let's hit the throttle
Drink in my cup, hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life

Yeah, everybody going crazy on the dance floor, jam packed
Got a couple bands back from the bank on my last trip like I ransacked
Everybody hanging like a string from a Tampax
Yes, my bitches back from the Amtrak
You ain't ever heard a flow quite like this
Everywhere I turn seeing iced out wrists
And she might be German, she might be Swiss (God damn)
And I'm feeling pretty hectic
Lights all around, good thing I'm not epileptic
I'm kinda confused like I'm measuring in metric
Talking shit, you better take it back, interception (back)
Now set the forests a blaze
And get the wild life jumping like an animal rave
I know your parents say they miss the good old days
But things change

I'm not done yet, pass me the bottle
It's two AM, let's hit the throttle
Drink in my cup, hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life

Hey you, come here girl, party with me (party with me)
You know it's gonna be a wild night (so wild)
Move that body to the melody (melody)
I could show you how to live the wild life (wild life)
You ain't gotta spend a dime, it's free (it's free)
You know it's gonna be a wild night (let's go)
Door's open, you don't need a key (no key)
I could show you how to live the wild life (wild life)

I'm not done yet, pass me the bottle
It's two AM, let's hit the throttle
Drink in my cup, hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
