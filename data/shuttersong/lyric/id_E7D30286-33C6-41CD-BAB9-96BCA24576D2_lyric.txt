Hey you'll scard
To do how I do it
I'm in the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up 
Mini skirt with my J's on
In the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up 
Mini skirt with my J's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
I be in the club standing on the couch
In them Wolf Greys
Like it's my house
Drinking out the bottle 
I got no respect
Looking like a model 
Who just got a check
I back it up 
Cause I don't give a fuck
If you're a lame 
That's a shame you
Can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly 
You can't touch
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club
Put on my J's and dance
The whole night away
I'm naughty by nature
Like I'm hip hop hooray
With my hands in the sky 
I wave 'em from side to side
My feet on the floor 
I'm about to turn up now
I'm in the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up 
Mini skirt with my J's on
In the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up 
Mini skirt with my J's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
I be rockin' J's or
I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors 
My kick game is major
More kicks than the players 
Call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw 
Tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley  Miley 
Come swing the thing right by me
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned 
Got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles 
I said 23
Put on my J's and dance
The whole night away
I'm naughty by nature
Like I'm hip hop hooray
With my hands in the sky 
I wave 'em from side to side
My feet on the floor 
I'm 'bout to turn up now
I'm in the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up  mini skirt with my J's on
In the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up 
Mini skirt with my J's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
I stay showin' out 
My kick game is a beast
I got thirty pair of J's
That ain't never been released
Flu game twelve 
Space Jam 11
On the hype beast sick 
They gon' need a paramedic
Turn up  turn up  turn up 
I get trippy  I stay live
All this purple in my cup 
Match them grape 5's
I'm so high 
I got three bitches that go by
I'm so fly 
I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer
Put on my J's and dance
The whole night away
I'm naughty by nature
Like I'm hip hop hooray
With my hands in the sky 
I wave 'em from side to side
My feet on the floor 
I'm 'bout to turn up now
I'm in the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up 
Mini skirt with my J's on
In the club high off purp
With some shades on
Tatted up 
Mini skirt with my J's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
