The light shines
It's getting hot on my shoulders
I don't mind, this time it doesn't matter
Cause your friends,
They look good but you look better
Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, round, round
Under the lights tonight
Turned around, and you stole my heart
Just one look, and I saw your face
Fell in love
Take a minute girl,
Steal my heart tonight
Just one look, yeah
I'm waiting for a girl like you
I'm weaker
My worlds fall and they hit the ground
All life come on here
Don't you fail me now
I start to say
I think I love you but I make no sound
Oh cause all all my life ive been waiting for a girl like you to come around
Under the lights tonight
Turned around, and you stole my heart
Just one look, and I saw your face
Fell in love
Take a minute girl, steal my heart tonight
Just one look, yeah
I'm waiting for a girl like you
There is no other place that I would rather be
Right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
Theres so much I wanna say
I wanna say
Under the lights tonight
Turned around, and you stole my heart
Just one look, and I saw your face
Fell in love
Take a minute girl, steal my heart tonight
Under the lights tonight
Turned around, and you stole my heart
Just one look, and I saw your face
Fell in love
Take a minute girl, steal my heart tonight
Just one look, yeah
I'm waiting for a girl like you
I'm waiting for a girl like you
