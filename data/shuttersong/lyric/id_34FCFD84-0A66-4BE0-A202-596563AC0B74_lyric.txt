"Unbreakable"
(feat. Miracle)

Times like this, I wish I never existed
Nobody wants to listen
I'm screaming out for help
Times like this, I wish that I could let go
And open up a window, free to be myself

But then there's you
Standing over me, tryna make a fool of me
Tryna get the best of me
Oh, then there's you
Tryna shut me out, tryna kick me when I'm down
That ain't gonna stop me now, no

How does it feel to know that I don't care at all?
Your words don't mean a thing at all
I chose to rise, you chose to fall
How does it feel to know that I am capable?
Of more than you will ever know

Don't tell me I'm not good enough
Don't you bring me down
I'm moving up and you're over now
You gave me fire
Everytime you came around
My feet are steady on the ground
And you won't knock me down

No more, oho, oho,
Now I'm unbreakable
Oho, oho, oho,
Now I'm unbreakable

Times like this, I'm picking up the pieces
I'm making up the reasons
Not to tell a soul

Times like this, I'd rather speak to no one
I just wanna move on, stand up on my own
But then there's you
Standing over me, tryna make a fool of me
Tryna get the best of me
Oh, then there's you
Tryna shut me out, tryna kick me when I'm down
That ain't gonna stop me now, no

How does it feel to know that I don't care at all?
Your words don't mean a thing at all
I chose to rise, you chose to fall
How does it feel to know that I am capable?
Of more than you will ever know

Don't tell me I'm not good enough
Don't you bring me down
I'm moving up and you're over now
You gave me fire
Everytime you came around
My feet are steady on the ground
And you won't knock me down

No more, oho, oho,
Now I'm unbreakable
Oho, oho, oho,
Now I'm unbreakable

I remember getting tease as a kid
Cause at the place that we lived
We never had it easy, believe me
But that don't excuse the things that we did

Wouldn't accept that I was never accepted
Shed so many tears like I fell in depression
But if I changed, I wouldn't get called names
But it was all the same, I was feeling rejected

Putting someone down that's a low blow
What goes around comes around like a yoyo
Wish that I could stop time like a photo
But we stand strong, bounce back like a pogo

Don't tell me I'm not good enough
Don't you bring me down
I'm moving up and you're over now
You gave me fire
Everytime you came around
My feet are steady on the ground
And you won't knock me down

No more, oho, oho,
Now I'm unbreakable
Oho, oho, oho,
Now I'm unbreakable
