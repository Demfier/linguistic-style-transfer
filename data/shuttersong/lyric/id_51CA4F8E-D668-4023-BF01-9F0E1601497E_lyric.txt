I used to be so happy but without you here I feel so low 

I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go 

Cause once upon a time you were my everything 

It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing 
 
It's buried deep inside me 
 
but I feel there's something you should know 
 
I will never forget you 

You will always be by my side 
 
From the day that I met you 

I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die 
 
And I will never want much more 

And in my heart I will always be sure 

I will never forget you 
 
And you will always be by my side 
 
'Til the day I die 
 
Til the day I die 
 
Til the day I die 
 
Til the day I die 

Funny how we both end up here 

but everything seems so right 
 
I wonder what would happen 

if we went back and put up a fight 
 
Cause once upon a time you were my everything 

It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing 

Just what do you think could ever take you off my mind 

I will never forget you 

You will always be by my side 

From the day that I met you 

I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die 

And I will never want much more 

And in my heart I will always be sure 

I will never forget you 
 
And you will always be by my side 

'Til the day I die 

Feeling it loving it everything that we do 
 
And all along I knew I had something special with you 

But sometimes you just gotta know 
 
that these things fall through 

But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you 

Feeling it loving it everything that we do 

And all along I knew I had something special with you 

But sometimes you just gotta know 

that these things fall through 
 
I can't hide my connection with you 
 
I will never forget you 

You will always be by my side 

From the day that I met you 

I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die 

And I will never want much more 

And in my heart I will always be sure 

I will never forget you 

And you will always be by my side 

'Til the day I die 

Til the day I die 'til the day I die 'til the day I die 
 
Til the day I die 'til the day I die 'til the day I die 

And you will always be by my side 

I will never forget you 
 
I will never never never never never never never never 
 
I will never forget you 
 
Til the day I die
