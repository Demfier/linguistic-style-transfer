And meet me there

Bundles of flowers

We wait through the hours of cold

Winter shall howl at the walls
Tearing down doors of time

Shelter as we go

Mmmmmmmmm
And promise me this
You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms
Surface
Far below these words
Mmmmmm
Maybe
Just maybe
I'll come home
Who am I
Darling to you
Who am I?
Going to tell you stories of mine
Who am I?
Who am I
Darling for you
Who am I?
Could be a burden in time
lonely
Who am I
To you
Who am I
Darling for you
Who am I?
Going to be a burden
Who am I
Darling to you
Who am I?
I come alone here
I come alone here
Hmmmmm
