I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, the the the the the
I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, the the the the the you the the the
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See I gave you faith turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping

Tell me he, where are จน now that I need you?
Where are จน now?
Where are จน now that I need you?

Couldn't find you anywhere.
When you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So, where are จน now that I need you?

Where are จน now that I need you?
Where are จน now that I need you? (now)
Where are จน now that I need you?
Where are จน now that I need you? (now)

I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure (that's for sure)
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord.

Where are จน now that I need you?
Where are จน now that I need you?
I need you, (the) I need you, I need you, (the) I need you, I need you,
Where are จน now that I need you?
I need you, (the) I need you, I need you,(the the the the)
I need you the most

Where are จน now that I need you? (now)
Where are จน now that I need you?
Where are จน now that I need you? (now)
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
