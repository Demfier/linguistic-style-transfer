Turn to You - Justin Bieber
You worked two jobs
To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me  no you never gave up
I admire you
For the strength you've instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age  when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me
So when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I  I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to you
It was '94  the year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman
You were forced to change your ways
To change your ways
Then you founded the lord
You gave your life to him
And you could not ignore
The love he had you
And I wanted more of your heart
So when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I  I still turn to you
I don't know what to do if you left me
So please don't go away
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today
So when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I  I still turn to you
To you  to you  to you
I Still Turn to you
To you  to you  to you
 I still turn to you
Cause I  I turn to you
