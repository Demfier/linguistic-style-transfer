Mustard on the beat, ho!

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl, I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuckin' like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do

Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You ain't even
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You ain't even
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You ain't even
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You ain't even
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em

Know you say you down wit it
Won't tell 'em how you hit the ground wit it
Girl, you know I'm from Chicago
I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it
In it, nobody take me out though
You got gifts, bbring 'em down to the south pole
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Don't you worry 'bout it might gon' work it out

Only it's you got me feelin' like this
Oh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbin' the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

Dely full, full wit it
But you know I know what to do wit it
I get it at, girl, I'm talkin' laps
As if you gotta pull wit it
And since she ain't wit your best friend
Then let me be your down wit
You know you feelin' how your boy press play
Just keep that ass re-windin'

Throw it up 9-3-4, 8-6-1-6
I gotta missed call from your bitch
She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like her in the shower, when it's wet and fresh
On my late-night thirsty, 'cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl, it ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds like I keep a secret
If anything you were just explorin', you wasn't cheatin'
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho
