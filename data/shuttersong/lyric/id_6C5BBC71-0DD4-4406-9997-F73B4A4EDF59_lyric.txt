Yeah, You know, technically, I'm not even really supposed to be here right now. So fuck it, might as well make the most of it... Feels good. Guess I'm lucky. Some of us don't get a second chance. But I ain't blowing this one. Nah, man. Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water?
Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em

(Cinderella man, Cinderella man

Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

There's a storm coming that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug, prick you better, flee cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down, I was kicked, I got up
I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick, it's a trap
Fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye
So bat your eyelashes, and keep winking and blowing kisses
Cause you're flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood, I ain't just hurting your rep
I catch a flow and get going, no remorse I'm showing
Ain't slowing for no one
Knowing there is nothing you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva: what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up stand behind you like \
