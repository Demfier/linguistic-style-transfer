
[Male talking softly]

Yeah, yeah
[Spoken] Just listen
All this time it's been on my mind
But I never said it
Went along like I did no wrong
But now I regret it
Should've probably listened more
Held your hand and opened doors
I've been taking you for granted
But I swear I never meant it

(Wanted many times to apologize) 
But it often went unsaid
(Got to figure out how to tell you now)
What's been going through my head

Sorry
Not an easy word to say
But I'm worried if I don't you'll walk away
And there's just no way that I can live
Unless I know that you'll forgive
Sorry
Baby, I'm so, so (spoken) sorry

Girl, I'm hoping it's not too late
I cross my fingers
Cross my heart I'm about to change my ways
Starting with this one word
(S) Promise I'm gonna stay around
(o) No more hanging out
(r) Let's reunite
(r) I'll make it right
(y) Cuz I need you in my life

(Sorry) Whoah
(Not an easy word to say) Sorry baby
(But I'm worried if I don't you'll walk away) Don't walk away
And there's just no way that I can live 
Unless I know that you'll forgive
Sorry
Baby, I'm so, so, so (spoken) sorry

Sorry for the times I didn't realize
That holding back my feelings brought tears to your eyes
Sorry for the times I didn't understand
A simple word that you deserved
Could make me a better man
Whoah 

(Sorry)
(Not an easy to word to say) Not an easy word
(But I'm worried if I don't you'll walk away) Don't walk away
(And there's just no way that I can live) I can live 
(Unless I know that you'll forgive) Just no way
(Sorry)
Now baby
(Overlapping) Baby-aaaby-baby, please
I'm so, so (spoken) sorry

(Sorry) For all the times I made you cry
(Not an easy to word to say) For all the times I told you lies
(But I'm worried) 
All the times I wasn't fair 
(If I don't you'll walk away) 
(And there's just no way) For all these things, yeah 
(That I can live) I can live
(Unless I know that you'll forgive) Unless I know you'll forgive me, ba-aa-aabe
Baby, I'm so, so, (spoken) sorry

Ooh ooooh
(Sorry) Sorry
(Not an easy word to say) Yeah
(But I'm worried if I don't you'll walk away) Yeah
(And there's just no way that I can live) Just no way that I can live
(Unless I know that you'll forgive) Please forgive me, baby, yeah
(Sorry)
Baby, I'm so, so (spoken) sorry
