You can roll the switch, I'ma roll back in the beat
Then we can do whatever you feel, I got a list
Just pick what you want, I had a bad day
Last one when people pissing me off,
But I will

They can try deny us, but in time they'll come around
And that's a fact, please jump in my arms like an athlete
And all we really have is each other, so
