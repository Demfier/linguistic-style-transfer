It's so easy to lose all of
me with who you are
What is your definition
of a true super star

Is it beauty, is it money
is it power, is it fame
Are you in it for your glory,
what's the purpose,
what's the gain

Everything you ever wanted
got tied up in chains
Be careful how you plat the game

'Cause the same ones that chose you
Same ones that own you,
Same ones that love you,
are the same on that shun you
Same ones that praise you
are the same ones that hate you

Funny how it all goes around

If you lose your soul,
you'll lose it all
If you're at the top
then brace for the fall

Surrounded by faces,
no one to call

Funny how it all goes around

If you lose your soul,
you'll lose it all
If you're at the top
then brace for the fall

Surrounded by faces,
no one to call

Funny how it all goes around

If you look through a microscope
at this messed up world
You will see every scratch, every fall,
every ounce of dirt

Your so called friends
your leaning on,
but all they do is take

You say it's fine but deep inside you
wish you could escape

Everything you ever wanted
got tied up in chains
Be careful how you plat the game

Same ones that love you,
are the same on that shun you
Same rules that blind you
are the same rules that guide you
Same ones that break you
