Yeah, everytime, you come around me
My heart starts pounding
It's like a clock
Tick-tock Tick-tock
You wound me up
Wouldn't want it any other way
You're so sweet and so gracious, smile's contagious
Water color eyes like sky so spacious
And I can't concentrate
You won't hear me complain

Yes you're perfect, you're perfect
You make me nervous
You're worth it, you're worth it
You give me purpose
Again and again, you don't even have to try
Because, because, you're always on my mind

Mind

Well it's been a couple weeks now
Still can't sleep now
Everything I do makes me think of you
Wanna reach out
And tell you that you're beautiful
And I think I'm going crazy, baby just maybe
You could be the one that I'm looking for to save me, wake me

I got it bad and that ain't good
I wouldn't change it if I could

Yes you're perfect, you're perfect
You make me nervous
You're worth it, you're worth it
You give me purpose
Again and again, you don't even have to try
Because, because, you're always on my mind
Mind
(you're perfect, you're perfect)
(you're perfect, you're perfect)
you're perfect, you're perfect
You make me nervous
You're worth it, you're worth it
You give me purpose
Again and again, you don't even have to try
Because, because, you're always on my mind
Mind, mind, you're always on my mind
(you're perfect, you're perfect)
(you're perfect, you're perfect
