Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth).
Don't care what you say to me, I'ma bite your feelings out (Gold up in my teeth).
I missed you in the basement
(Gold up in my teeth).
But your brother was a good substitute for you.

And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go.
And when the roof is on fire; you never let me know.
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show it.
And I could leave a party without ever letting you know; without ever letting you know.
