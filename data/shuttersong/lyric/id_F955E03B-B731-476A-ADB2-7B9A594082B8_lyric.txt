When I first saw you standing there
You know, was a little hard not to stare
So nervous when I drove you home
I know being apart's a little hard to bear

Send some flowers to your work in hopes
That I'd have you in my arms again
We kissed that night before I left
Still now was something I can never forget

You've got all that I need

Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
With you I know that I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try
We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I

Let's take a chance, go far away today
And never look back again
Since I said I loved you in Las Vegas
Never been the same since then

You've got all that I need

Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
With you I know that I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try

We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I

This is it, nothing to hide
One more kiss, never say goodbye
This is it
Babe, you're all mine

Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
I know that I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try
Got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
With you I know that I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try
We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe, it's you and I
Babe, it's you and I
