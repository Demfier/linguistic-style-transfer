All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk
To you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around
when im alluded to
This will not do
'Cos i was raised up
To be admired
To be noticed
But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes
Are on you
This will not do
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
Im faking glory
Lick my lips toss my hair
And send a smile over
And the stories brand new
But i can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, oh oh
And i can tell you that
when the lights come on
I'll be ready for this
It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms
That happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scale
Without thinking of size
I was frightened
Of every little thing
That i thought was out ot get me down
To trip me up
And laugh at me
But i learnt not to want
The quiet of the room
With no on around to find me out
I want the applause
The approval
The things that make me go
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, oh oh
And i can tell you that
When the lights come on
I'll be ready for this
It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms
That happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scale
Without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing
That i thought was out to get me down
To trip me up
And laugh at me
But l learnt not to want
The quiet of the room
With no one around to find me out
I want the applause
The approval
The things to make me go
Oh oh oh ooh ooh
End
