The Wire - Haim
You know I'm bad at communication
It's the hardest thing for me to do
And they say it's the most important part
Of the relationships I go through
And I give it all away
Just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway
You know there's no rhyme or reason
For the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind
Not intentionally

I know it's hard to hear me say it
But I can't bear to stay
And I just know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right

It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

It felt right
It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

The way you use your imagination
Try to make it what you want it to be
Because I'm sorry I did what I did
But it came naturally
And I give it all away
Just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway
Well, I try to keep myself together
After all the opportunities

Try to stay true to you and try to do
What you wanted from me
And I give it all away just to hear you say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

It felt right
It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right

It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire

Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

It felt right
It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right
It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right
It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

It felt right

It felt right

It felt right

But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
