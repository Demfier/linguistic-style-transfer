25 years of my life and still
25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this
Brotherhood of man
For whatever that means
So I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed
To get it all out what's in my head
Then I start feeling a little peculiar
So I wake in the morning and I step
Outside I take deep breath
I get real high
Then I scream from the top of my lungs
What's goin' on
What's goin' on
And I say hey...
And I say hey...
And I say hey...
And I say hey...
And I say hey...
And I say hey what's goin' on
I said hey what's goin' on
I said hey what's goin' on

oh oh oh oh ha
oh oh oh oh ha
oh oh oh oh ha
and I try, oh my god do I try
I take a deep breaththen I get real high
I try all the time
in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs
What's going on?
I said hey what's goin' on........
I said hey
And I say hey, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?
