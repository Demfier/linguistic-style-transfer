Summer breeze
Coco Keys
Hanging out you and me
In the sun, oh oh
Ben and Jerry's cups and cones
Wasting time playing games on our phones
Oh well
We seem so picture perfect
We love without a purpose
We love without a purpose
But deep beneath the surface
You're making me nervous

You're making me so nervous
You're holding me down with your gravity
with your gravity

I need to fly free, but you imprison me
with your gravity oh...
It's killing me, I gotta leave
I'm moving on and on and on
Now I see what's best for me
Escaping your gravity
Back at home Kensal Row
You light up on my phone, oh oh; I don't know

Should I pick it up or ignore? Hold you close
Build a wall or chase you right out the door?
But deep beneath the surface
You're making me nervous
You're making me so nervous

You're holding me down with your gravity
with your gravity
I need to fly free, but you imprison me

with your gravity oh...
It's killing me, I gotta leave
I'm moving on and on and on
Now I see what's best for me
Escaping your gravity
Escaping your gravity
You hold me down with your gravity
your gravity
I need to fly free, from your gravity

It's killing me, oh
You're holding me down with your gravity
with your gravity
I need to fly free, but you imprison me

with your gravity oh...
It's killing me, I gotta leave
I'm moving on and on and on
Now I see what's best for me
Escaping gravity
Escape your gravity
