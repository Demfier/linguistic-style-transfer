Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Don't stop ringing those jingle bells

Jingle bells
Jingle bells

Jingle bells
Jingle bells

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O’er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells
Jingle bells

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Don't stop ringing those jingle bells

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Don't stop ringing those jingle bells

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Don't stop ringing those jingle bells

Jingle bells
Jingle bells
Don't stop ringing those jingle bells
