Hey brother, there¡¯s an endless road to rediscover,
Hey sister, now the water's sweet but blood is thicker,
Ooo, if the sky comes falling down for you,
There¡¯s nothing in this world I wouldn¡¯t do.
Hey brother, do you still believe in one another?
Hey sister, do you still believe in love I wonder?
Ooo, if the sky comes falling down for you,
There¡¯s nothing in this world I wouldn¡¯t do.
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear your call,
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out,
Ooo, if the sky comes falling down for you,
There¡¯s nothing in this world I wouldn¡¯t do.
