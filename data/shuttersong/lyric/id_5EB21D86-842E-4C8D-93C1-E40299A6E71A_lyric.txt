I found God\n On the corner of First and Amistad\n Where the west\n Was all but won\n All along\n Smoking his last cigarette\n I said  where've you been \n He said  ask anything \n Where were you \n When everything was falling apart \n All my days spent by the telephone \n And all I needed was a call\n It never came\n To the corner of First and Amistad\n Lost and insecure  you found me  you found me\n Lying on the floor  surrounded  surrounded\n Why'd you have to wait \n Where were you  Where were you \n Just a little late \n You found me  you found me \n But in the end\n Everyone ends up alone\n Losing her\n The only one who's ever known\n Who I am  Who I'm not  Who I want to be\n No way to know\n How long she will be next to me\n Lost and insecure  you found me  you found me\n Lying on the floor  surrounded  surrounded\n Why'd you have to wait \n Where were you  Where were you \n Just a little late \n You found me  you found me \n Early morning city breaks \n I've been calling for years and years and years and years \n You never left me no messages;\n You never send me no letters;\n You got some kind of nerve taking all of our love \n Lost and insecure  you found me  you found me\n Lying on the floor\n Where were you  Where were you \n Lost and insecure  you found me  you found me\n Lying on the floor  surrounded  surrounded\n Why'd you have to wait \n Where were you  Where were you \n Just a little late \n You found me  you found me \n Why'd you have to wait \n To find me \n To find me
