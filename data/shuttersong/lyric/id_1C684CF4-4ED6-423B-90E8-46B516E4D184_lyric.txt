You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war.
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door.
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we start keeping score.
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more.

Yeah, but baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you.
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go.
Got you stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo.
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, crawling back to you.

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night


Trying  to tell you no, but  my body keeps on telling you yes
Trying  to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me  so out of breath
 I'd be waking up, in the morning probably hating myself
 And  i'd be waking up, feeling sastified but guilty as hell
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah  I stopped using  my head, using  my head let it all go
Got you stuck on  my body, on  my body like a tattoo
 And now  i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back  to you
 So  I  cross  my  heart,  and  I  hope  to  die,
that  i'll only stay with you one more night
 And  I know  i've said it a million times
But  i'll only stay with you one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
But baby there you again, there you again making me love you
Yeah  I stopped using  my head, using  my head let it all go
Got you stuck on  my body, on  my body like a tattoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 So  I  cross  my  heart,  and  I  hope  to  die,
that  i'll only stay with you one more night
 And  I know  i've said it a million times
But  i'll only stay with you one more night
yeah baby give me one more night
 So  I  cross  my  heart,  and  I  hope  to  die,
that  i'll only stay with you one more night
 And  I know  i've said it a million times
But  i'll only stay with you one more night
