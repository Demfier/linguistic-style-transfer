Lately I'm feeling stupid and crazy
'Cause I saw him with his new baby
And he treats her like she's the one
It's not that I want him back, ain't trying to be mean
But I bought him brand new clothes and burned his skinny jeans
And she'll never know that I made him better for her

So, give some credit where it's due
Give props to you know who
I gave him swag
I made him cool
He used to be a fool
So, give some credit where it's due
Give props to you know who, you know who
Give credit where its due, hey

Oooh-wee, he holds her hand at the movies
Never stares at other boobies
I bet she thinks he's the one (she does)
She should be thanking me and sending me some flowers
I thought him everything, now he can last for hours
She'll never know that I've made him better for her

So, give some credit where it's due
Give props to you know who
I gave him swag
I made him cool
He used to be a fool
So, give some credit where it's due
Give props to you know who, you know who
Give credit where its due, hey

Yo, he used to be whack
But I made him all that
Well shit, if you think of my last name
I guess my trainings where it's at
Had him brushing his teeth, even flossing
Got him looking like Ryan Gosling
I guess that makes me pretty awesome
But I wasn't in love, so I tossed him

So, give some credit where it's due
Give props to you know who
I gave him swag
I made him cool
He used to be a fool
So, give some credit where it's due
Give props to you know who, you know who
Give credit where its due, hey

Give me that credit, baby baby
Give me that credit, baby baby
Give me that credit, baby baby
'Cause you know who
Credit where it's due, hey
You'll never know, you'll never know
He wasn't like this before
You'll never know, you'll never know
Unless you're hearing this song
