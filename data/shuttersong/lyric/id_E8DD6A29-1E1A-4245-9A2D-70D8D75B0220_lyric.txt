All That Matters - Justin Bieber
Uh-oh  just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in the light
Not just for the meanwhile
For a long long time  better believe it
Uh-oh  whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings  yeah
So I sleep through the daylight  stay awake all night
Till you back again  yeah  yeah
You think I'm biased
Too much I never get other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next day bothers you  I
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah  ain't worry about nobody else
If it ain't you  I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah  yeah  what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Take the keys out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you  and only you
Uh-oh  I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart please believe
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah  ain't worry about nobody else
If it ain't you  I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah  yeah  what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah
You're all that matters to me
