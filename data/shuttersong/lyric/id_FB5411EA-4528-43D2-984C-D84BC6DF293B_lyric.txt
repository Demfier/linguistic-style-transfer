Wake up, wake up

Your heart is heavier today

Can you feel it?

Keep your eyes wide

For fear of being lead astray

Oh it hurts, hurts to love you

When you open your eyes wide

You're not sleeping on the other side

The light is gone and your heart is tired

You're not sleeping on the other side

Don't think, don't fight

You're reminiscing us away

By the minute

Leave yesternight

Obey the sound of yesterday

Oh it hurts, hurts to love you

Oh it hurts, hurts to love you

When you open your eyes wide

You're not sleeping on the other side

The light is gone and your heart is tired

You not sleeping on the other side

And don't you know?

You live a lie

And don't you know?

Cause in your sleep you started talking

I lost my mind

Oh I'd love to wake you, I'd love to wake you up

Oh I'd love to wake you, I'd love to wake you up

When you open your eyes wide

You're not sleeping on the other side

The light is gone and your heart is tired

You're not sleeping on the other side

And don't you know? (You live a lie)

And don't you know? (You live a lie)

Cause in your sleep you started talking

I lost my mind

And don't you know? (When you open your eyes wide)

And don't you know? (You're not sleeping on the other side)

Cause in your sleep you started talking (The light is gone and your heart is tired)

I'd love to wake you, I'd love to wake you up
