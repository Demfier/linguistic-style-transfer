I didn't know you were an actor
Played every part
Climbed up the ladder

Taking your time
Taking the longer way
But they took your life

From you, sign those papers
I couldn't help, I couldn't save ya
They wrote the lines
They thought you should say
If I could hide you under my cape
Tuck you away in my suitcase
When you get tired of being alone
Anywhere but here is home

It's not in your deal
When you say when I will
Leave behind the world

Faces on film
...
My favorite scenes are when you're escaping

Finding a place you could be safe in
Hiding your eyes
Cover them with your hair
You follow the road
You know where it's winding
You do what your told
Or you truly deciding
Tells me your part

That we had to find a way
If I could hide you under my cape
Tuck you away in my suitcase
When you get tired of being alone
Anywhere but here is home
It's not in your deal
When you say when I will
Leave behind the world
Faces on film
...
If I could hide you under my cape
Tuck you away in my suitcase
When you get tired of being alone
Anywhere but here is home
It's not in your deal
If you're so good, I fear
It's the underneath that's real
Let's leave behind the world
Faces on film
