I am a dreamer and I'm a lover
I've been let down and I've loved and lost
I've been alone, I've been far from home

Follow your heart, follow your heart
Follow your heart and you won't get lost

I've been a poor man, I've been a rich man
I made a fortune and I've paid the cost
I've had some good friends, they come and go

Follow your heart, follow your heart
Follow your heart and you won't get lost

I've been cheated, I've been defeated
I played the game and I've been double crossed
Every friend of mine has been in hard times

Follow your heart, follow your heart
Follow your heart and you won't get lost
Follow your heart, follow your heart
Follow your heart and you won't get lost
