Just when things are getting complicated
In the eye of the storm
She flicks a red hot revelation
Off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen summersaults
& leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet booby trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism
& put them in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah
Hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated
In the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

& in a Hellcat-spangled cavern
When your judgement's on the run
& you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun
& did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before
Her steady hands may well have done
The devil's pedicure
What you waiting for
Singing another fucking shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
