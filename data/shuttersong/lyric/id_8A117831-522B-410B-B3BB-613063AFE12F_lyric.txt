下午天的日光
I'm here for you baby
你我踏著星光
Wanna spend more time with you

你感到厭倦吧
跟著這節奏吧
很想跳舞吧
come and dance with me, babe

the sun is shining my heart is pounding
and let our bodies surrender

let the light move your feet to the beat
hold me close and never let go

Take my hand, take a chance, at the daytime disco
Take a chance, for romance, at the day time disco

日光的照耀下
wrap your arms around me
一起迎接初夏
dance all-night with you, babe

I want you close to me
can you feel my warmth babe?

Please dance with me all day
Only dance with me babe

the sun is shining my heart is pounding
and let our bodies surrender

let the light move your feet to the beat
hold me close and never let go

Take my hand, take a chance, at the day time disco
Take a chance, for romance, at the day time disco
