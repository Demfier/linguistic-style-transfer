It's hard
hard, not to sit on your hands
buring your head in the sand
hard, not to make other plans
and claim that you've done all you can

all alone
and life
must go on.
It's hard
hard, to stand up for what's right

and bring home the bacon each night

hard, not to break down and cry
when every ideal that you tried
has been wrong.
But you must
carry on.

It's hard
but you know it's worth the fight
cause you know you've got the truth on your side
when the accusations fly.
Hold tight!
Don't be afraid of what they'll say.
Who cares what cowards think? Anyway
They will understand some day
some day.
It's hard
hard, when you're here all alone

and everyone else's gone home.
Harder to know right from wrong
when all objectivity's gone
and it's gone.
But you still
carry on.? cause you
you are the only one left
and you've got to clean up this mess.
You know you'll end up like the rest
Bitter and twisted - unless
you stay strong
And you
carry on.
It's hard
but you know it's worth the fight
cause you know you've got the truth on your side
when the accusations fly.
Hold tight!
Don't be afraid of what they'll say.
Who cares what cowards think? Anyway
They will understand some day
some day.
