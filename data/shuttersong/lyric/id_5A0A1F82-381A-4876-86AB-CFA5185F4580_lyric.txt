I took my baby on a saturday bang
boy is that girl with you
yes we're one and the same
Now i believe in miracles and a miracle
has happened tonight
but if you're thinkin' about my baby

it don't matter if you're black or white
they print my message in the saturday sun
i had to tell them i ain't second to none
and i told about equality and it's true
either you're wrong or you're right
but if you're thinkin' about my baby

it don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
i am tired of this stuff
i am tired of this business
sew when the going gets rough
i ain't scared of your brother
i ain't scared of no sheets
i ain't scared of nobody

girl when the goin' gets mean
Protection for gangs clubs and nations
causing grief in human relations
it's a turf war on a global scale
i'd rather hear both sides of the tale
see it's not about races just places faces
where your blood comes from is where your space is
i've seen the bright get duller

i'm not going to spend my life being a color
don't tell me you agree with me when i saw you
kicking dirt in my eye
but if you're thinkin' about my baby
it don't matter if you're black or white
i said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
it don't matter if you're black or white
i said if you're thinkin' of being my baby

it don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh ooh yea yea yea now

ooh ooh yea yea yea now
It's black it's white
it's tough for them to get by
it's black it's white
it's black it's white
it's tough for them to get by
it's black it's white whoo
