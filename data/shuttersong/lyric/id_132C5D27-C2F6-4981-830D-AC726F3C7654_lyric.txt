Memphis (feat  Big Sean) - Justin Bieber\n I love you  I need you  I need you here to stay\n Girl are you on my mind like 24/7\n Every single time that I'm not with you\n If you spend the night baby it could be heaven\n Hit me on my line if you tryna come through\n I feel my heartbeat bumpin to the bass\n She give me butterflies and they won't go away (away away)\n Under the stars she took my hand and said\n I love you  I need you  I need you here to stay\n I'd like to give you what you need\n I'd try but you're making it hard for me\n How do I make you believe \n 'Cause I love you  I need you \n I need you here to stay\n I'd like to give you what you need\n I'd try but you're making it hard for me\n How do I make you believe \n 'Cause I love you  I need you \n I need you here to stay\n Every time in this thing girl something is missing\n And wish that I could fix it \n I wish things were different\n What else  What else \n If you love me girl then say it\n Say what else  What else \n If you wanna be my baby\n I feel my heartbeat bumpin to the bass\n She give me butterflies and they won't go away (away away)\n Under the stars she took my hand and said\n I love you  I need you  I need you here to stay\n I'd like to give you what you need\n I'd try but you're making it hard for me\n How do I make you believe \n 'Cause I love you  I need you \n I need you here to stay\n I'd like to give you what you need\n I'd try but you're making it hard for me\n How do I make you believe \n 'Cause I love you  I need you \n I need you here to stay\n Is this what you want \n The baddest \n I know what you want without askin\n I hear one side to have it\n I hear twice is a habit\n Don't get caught up in traffic\n I heard that it's hazardous storm and I'm sorry \n Let's do that on the mattress\n I just keep askin is it real  Is it real \n Look tell me is it real \n Yep  real enough to go and get it tatted\n Getting flowers \n Now you look like you won a pageant\n I can take you to the crib  condo \n Where the cabin wussup \n If you make it I can make it happen  I can grant it\n Don't you think my granny fell for granted\n I know that's how she end 10 \n We ain't even cappin and to leave this bed\n I'mma need a fuckin ransom \n Man I got er screamin finally famous\n When we fly around\n Never lie to you less I lyin down\n I put the writing on the wall\n But you don't understand it all like we in China Town\n We one in one  both one live once\n And when you put the twos together\n That's now 22  it's forever\n I promise 2020 couldn't even make it clearer\n I swear  Sean Don\n I'd like to give you what you need\n I'd try but you're making it hard for me\n How do I make you believe \n 'Cause I love you  I need you \n I need you here to stay\n I'd like to give you what you need\n I'd try but you're making it hard for me\n How do I make you believe \n 'Cause I love you  I need you \n I need you here to stay
