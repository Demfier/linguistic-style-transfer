Stealing kisses from your Mrs.
Doesn't make you freak out?
Got you fussin', got you worried
Scared to let your guard down

(Boys, boys)

Tell the neighbors I'm not sorry if I'm breaking walls down
Building your girl's second story
Ripping all your floors out

Saw your face, heard your name
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new

Isn't this why we came?
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new

(Boys, boys, boys)

Always gonna steal your thunder, watch me like a dark cloud
On the move collecting numbers, Imma take your girl out

We will be everything that we'd ever need
Don't tell me, tell me what I feel
I'm real and I don't feel like boys
I'm real and I don't feel like boys

Saw your face, heard your name
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new

Isn't this why we came? Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
I've been crossing all the lines, all the lines
Kissed your girls
That made you cry, boys
(boys)
Saw your face, heard your name
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
Isn't this why we came? Tell me if you feel it too! Tell me
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
