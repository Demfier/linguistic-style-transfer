I know a girl wants to be my friend,
She's a 10, but I don't want to be her friend
Cause I want something more in the end, in the end

I wanna tell her

You're my American pie and I really, really want a piece,
Cause you, keep my adrenaline high, and I'm never getting over this,
And now I'm singin'

You're in somebody else's bed,
You say you want me there instead,
You keep on messin' with my head,
When we get close to the end zone,
You put me back in the friend zone,
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone,
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone.

You got me sprung like a spring girl,
You got me photo for the ring girl,
Give me a shot and a mean girl,
But you ain't givin' me a thing girl.

I wanna tell her.

Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone.

You're in somebody else's bed,
I'll climb through the window and break his head,
But you're all I ever wanted.
