Take your seat and just listen up
'Cause this rhyming reason done too much
I'm a diamond dozen thrown to sea
You'll have to wait and see

You can have all of your outbreaks
If you let me make my own mistakes
I lie awake in my own head

Because of you
I'm gone for good and that's the truth
Because of you
I'm gone for good, I'll be brand new
You can break me down just like you did before
Because of you
I'm gone for good and that's me over and out

I hear the sirens at the door
They're always coming back for more
I'm left with pockets of regret
Swear I won't forget
The tragedy of successes
Believing in second chonces
I lie awake in my own head, woah

Because of you
I'm gone for good and that's the truth
Because of you
I'm gone for good, I'll be brand new
You can break me down just like you did before
Because of you
I'm gone for good and that's me over and out
That's me over and out

So take me as I am
Take me for everything
Replacing who I am
With who I'd rather be
So take me as I am
Take me for everything
Replacing who I am

Because of you
I'm gone for good and that's the truth
Because of you
I'm gone for good, I'll be brand new
You can break me down just like you did before
Because of you
I'm gone for good and that's me over and out
That's me over and out
That's me over and out
