Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh

Can we take it nice and
Slow, slow
Break it down and drop it
Low, low
Cause I just wanna
Party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we can keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good at mouth to mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in
Breathe me out
So amazin'

Oh, oh

Can we take it nice and
Slow, slow
Break it down and drop it
Low, low
Cause I just wanna
Party all night in the neon lights 'til you can let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

Breathe me in
Breathe me out
The music's got me going
Breathe me in
Breathe me out
No stoppin' til the morning
Breathe me in,
Breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it
For it
For it
Yeah

Breathe me in
Breathe me out
The music's got me going
Breathe me in
Breathe me out
No stoppin' til the morning
Breathe me in
Breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it
For it
For it!
Yeah!

(I-It's the cataracts)

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

How do I do it?
I-I-It's the cataracts
Ha ha ha
