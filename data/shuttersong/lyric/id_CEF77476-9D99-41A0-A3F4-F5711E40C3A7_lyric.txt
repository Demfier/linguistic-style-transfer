Lah, lah
Lah, lah-ah-ah-ah

You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pom-pom
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song
I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

My problem
I never was a model
I never was a scholar
But you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
'Cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

So catch up
'Cause you've got an awful long way to go
So catch up
'Cause you've got an awful long way to go

Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Picking on me like a dinner plate
You hit during classes, and in between them
Dunked me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them

You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, got everyone clapping, asking
