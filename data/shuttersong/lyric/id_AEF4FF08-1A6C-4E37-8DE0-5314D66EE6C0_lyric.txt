We plow the fields and scatter the good seed on the land.
But it is fed and watered by God's almighty hand.
He sends us snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain...
The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain...

ALL: All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heaven above
Then thank the Lord, thank the Lord for all his love...

ALL: We thank thee then, O Father, for all things bright and good,
HIGH NOTES: The seedtime and the harvest, our life our health our food,
ALL: No gifts have we to offer for all thy love imparts
HIGH NOTES: But that which thou desirest, our humble thankful hearts!

ALL: All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heaven above.
GRANT: Then thank the Lord, thank the Lord for all his love.

I really wanna thank you Lord!
All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heaven above.
Then thank the Lord, oh thank the Lord for all his love.
