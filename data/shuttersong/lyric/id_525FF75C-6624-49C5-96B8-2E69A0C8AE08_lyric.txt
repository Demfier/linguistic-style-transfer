Tonight we're fading fast
I just wanna make this last
If I could say the things I want to say,
I'd find a way to make you stay
I'd never let you get away
Get you in all the games we play

So go ahead, rip my heart out,
Show me what love's all about
Go ahead, rip my heart out
That's what love's all about

I want you to want me this way,
And I need you to need me to stay
If you say that you don't feel a thing
If you don't know, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
If you don't know then just let me go

Let's forget the past
I swear we'll make this last
'Cause I remember the taste of your skin tonight
And the way that you looked, you had those eyes
I remember the way I felt inside
And the name of the songs that made you cry
You would scream, we would fight, you would call me crazy
I would laugh, you were mad but you'd always kiss me
And the shirt that I had that you always borrowed
When I woke, it was gone
There was no tomorrow

I want you to want me this way,
And I need you to need me to stay
If you say that you don't feel a thing
If you don't know, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
If you don't know then just let me go

Go ahead, rip my heart out,
If you think that's what love's all about
Go ahead, rip my heart out
Go ahead, rip my heart out
Go ahead, rip my heart out,
If you think that's what love's all about
Go ahead, rip my heart out
Go ahead, rip my heart out

I want you to want me this way,
And I need you to need me to stay
If you say that you don't feel a thing
If you don't know, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
If you don't know then just let me go
