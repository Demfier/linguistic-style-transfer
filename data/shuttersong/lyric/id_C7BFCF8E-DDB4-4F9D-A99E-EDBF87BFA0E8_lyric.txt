(Beau):
I don't really care,
When you say that girls just wanna have fun,
When I do her hair,
Every single day to the end of the month.
Hey look at this one,
Fine as hell but missed some,
And if we get screws and pistons
That's why I could never pick one.

I know you call me 'cause you have no place to go,
If you want me 'cause you're lonely,
I'll pretend you ain't a hoe.
'Cause you're fine, you know you're fine,
That's why you're mine just like your ball,
Of compliments and confidence,
Aye, That's how it goes, oh.

(Jai):
Oh Woah,
You were just an LA Girl,
That I would never fall for,
A Spoiled little LA Girl
I don't really need that.
You were just an LA Girl,
Acting like you own the world,
Stupid little LA Girl,
And I don't really need that.

(Luke) Bridge:
Big Butt and a face like Cali,
Take's more than a pretty face to wow me,
She can't go anywhere without me,
She's an LA Girl and she's never been to Cali.

2 (James):
I got a girl as fine as shit and I want all y'all to know,
But the problem with this chick is that she comin' and we go,
When we making all the pauses,
Into her appartment,
Know that I'm an artist,
So why you think I got shit.
You acting like you want me but you just want some clothes,
Yeah, I know I got a side base, you are just a pro,
Man, I call you 'cause you stay up,
Tap you so you wake up,
Fine as a day job,
You are getting laid off.

If lodging (If lodging)
Is a problem. (Is a problem)
There's a hotel (There's a hotel)
That can solve it
