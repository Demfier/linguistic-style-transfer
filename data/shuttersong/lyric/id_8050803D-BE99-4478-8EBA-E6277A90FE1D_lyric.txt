Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you\n I'm still alright to smile\n Girl  I think bout you every day now\n Was a time when I wasn't sure\n But you set my mind at ease\n There is no doubt you're in my heart now\n Said woman take it slow \n And it'll work itself out fine\n All we need is just a little patience\n Said sugar take it slow\n And we'll come together fine\n All we need is just a little patience\n (patience)\n Mmmm  yeah\n I sit here on the stairs\n 'Cause I'd rather be alone\n If I can't have you right now I'll wait dear\n Sometimes I get so tense\n But I can't speed up the time\n But you know love\n There's one more thing to consider\n Said woman take it slow\n And it'll work itself out fine\n You and I'll just use a little patience\n Said sugar take the time\n Cause the lights are shining bright\n You and I've got what it takes to make it\n We won't fake it  I'll never break it\n 'Cause I can't take it\n Little patience  mmm yeah  mm yeah\n Need a little patience  yeah\n Just a little patience  yeah\n Some more patience  yeah\n I've been walking the streets at night\n Just trying to get it right\n Its hard to see with so many around\n You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd\n And the streets don't change\n But maybe the names\n I ain't got time for the game cause I need you\n Yeah  yeah  yeah  'cause I need you\n Ooo I need you  whoa I need you\n Ooooh  all this time\n (ah)
