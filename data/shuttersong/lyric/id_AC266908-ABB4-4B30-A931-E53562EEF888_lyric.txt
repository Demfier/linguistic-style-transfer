You better keep that demon outside
Of your heart
You better keep that demon outside

You oughta keep your women inside
Of your home
You oughta keep your women inside

You better lock up all your doors
And start to hide
You better lock up all your doors

He'll take you like he took me in the night
Too scared to fight
Take you like he took me in the night

You got to go
He's coming for you
Please let me go
I need to be saved too

You got to go
He's coming for you
Please let me go
I need to be saved too

You need to watch out for his lies
In those eyes
You need to watch out for his lies

He'll drag you in the dirt until you've died
Full of pride
Drag you in the dirt until you've died

You got to go
He's coming for you
Please let me go
I need to be saved too

You got to go
He's coming for you
Please let me go
I need to be saved too

You got to go
You got to go
You got to go
You got to go
You got to go
You got to go
You got to go
You got to go
