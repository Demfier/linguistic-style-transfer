Have you ever wondered about our old
Nu-metal friends and what became of them?
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing

I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself
I don't want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be

And they said, "Hey Nate, yeah, it's been a while,
Are you gonna sing?"
And I began to smile and I said
"You should've seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing."

It's such a gas when you bring up the past
I don't want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out

Oh oh, oh
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
Oh oh, oh
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be

Just get it out
Doo doo doo
Wooh ooh
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be

And they said we would've seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show
But youth's taken over by rock and roll
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing
¡°
That's my life, nothing is sacred
¡ª Fun.

So I left, that is it
That's my life, nothing is sacred
I don't keep friends, I keep acquainted
I'm not a prophet but I'm here to profit

That's all, I'm gone!
That's my life, nothing is sacred
I don't fall in love, I just fake it
I don't fall in love, I don't fall in love
