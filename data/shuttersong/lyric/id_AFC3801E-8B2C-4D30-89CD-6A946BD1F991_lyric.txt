Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning 'round my head, & I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on a silky smooth perfume
Right my little pooh bear
Wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air
Kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so, but

You just gonna cry
You just wanna know those
Peanut butter vibes
My my simple sir
This ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words &

Tipsy, topsy slurs
I can't take this place
No, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where

I can get some space
Truth be told
I've been here, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up, & puff it into plumes

Right my little pooh bear
Wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air
Kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so, but
You just gonna cry

You just wanna know those
Peanut butter vibes
My, my simple sir
This ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words &
Tipsy, topsy slurs
I can't take this place
No, I can't take this place

I just wanna go where
I can get some space
Hold my hand & float back
To the summer time
Tangled in the willows

Now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you?
How can I be nice?
Trippin' 'round the tree stumps
In your summer smile
Right my little pooh bear
Wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air
Kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so, but
You just gonna cry
You just wanna know those
Peanut butter vibes
My, my simple sir
This ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words &
Tipsy, topsy slurs
I can't take this place
No, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where
I can get some space
