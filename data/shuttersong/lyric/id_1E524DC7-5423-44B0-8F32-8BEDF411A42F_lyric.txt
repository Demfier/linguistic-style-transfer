 I come in peace¡± so  I took  you home 
 I gave  you food and  I gave  you clothes 
 I taught  you how to move your feet when the rhythms on 
Still  you wanna leave ¡®cause  you feel alone 
 You don't know what they're like 
If they know that  you're alive 
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life 
 I know  you must be upset,  you lost your family  in a wreck 
But  you gotta listen 
Don't try to find your spaceship 
It might be out there waiting 
Stay  in my backpack forever 
Stay  in my backpack forever 
( You know  I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting,  I can't stay  in your backpack forever) 
Before  you came around  I was  in a rut 
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was 
 You taught how to dream and how to love 
 You're my best friend please listen to me 
 You don't know what they're like 
If they know that  you're alive 
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life 
 I know  you must be upset,  you lost your family  in a wreck 
But  you gotta listen 
Don't try to find your spaceship 
It might be out there waiting 
Stay  in my backpack forever 
Stay  in my backpack forever 
( You know  I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting,  I can't stay  in your backpack forever) 
Greetings,  I fell from the sky 
 I'm from a different world  I use Lil Wayne as a disguise 
And my flying saucer crashed,  I'm the only one that survived 
 I'm only taking over this planet since  I arrived 
 I'm  in a backpack,  I'm  in ducking Men  in Black 
Yeah,  I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world 
Different galaxy, they try to capture me 
When  I die they gonna name this planet after me 
Wayne's world 
Don't try to find your spaceship 
It might be out there waiting 
Stay  in my backpack forever 
Stay  in my backpack forever 
( You know  I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting,  I can't stay  in your backpack forever) 
On our planet we don't kill one another 
We don't take love for granted 
It's a gift from the mother 
 In your planet,  you are filled with greed and false belief 
We came here to bring  you  peace
