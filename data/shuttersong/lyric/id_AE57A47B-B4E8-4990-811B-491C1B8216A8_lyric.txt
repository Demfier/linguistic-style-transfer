In the Pines - Brad Paisley Carl Jackson
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine
In the pines  in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
Well I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
Now it's a long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
In the pines  in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
Little girl  little girl  what have I done
That makes you treat me so 
You have caused me to weep
You caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home
In the pines  in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
In the pines  in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
