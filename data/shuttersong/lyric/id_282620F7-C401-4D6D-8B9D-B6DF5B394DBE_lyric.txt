Flowers bloom, a love is born
Two hearts collide
If you ever feel a thorn, I'll be there by your side
Nothing will ever hurt you
I will keep you safe
Two hearts, one soul
This love is forever
Two hands, will hold
This love together
One part of life is love
Loooove
Loooove
Loooove
Love
Loooove
Forever love
Save your kisses for the one
You grows up way too fast
There's a chance for everyone
You gotta make it last
Nothing will ever hurt you
I will keep you safe
Two hearts, one soul
This love is forever
Two hands, will hold
This love together
One part of life is love
Loooove
Loooove
Loooove
Love
Loooove
Forever love
Nothing will ever change our lives
Two hearts, one soul
This love is forever
Two hands, will hold
This love together
Two hearts, one soul
This love is forever
Two hands, will hold
This love together
One part of life is love
Loooove
Loooove
Loooove
Love
Loooove
Forever love
Forever love
