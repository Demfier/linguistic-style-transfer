Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the path

And I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms
Cause you get lighter
the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

And I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky
Cause in sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

I think I see you
I think I see you
Cause you're a sky
You're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view.
