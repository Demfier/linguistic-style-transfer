La da da da da da
La da da da da da
I'm never gonna pick up baby
Go ahead and give up cuz
You're never gonna get a second chance
You weren't even wasted when
You said Id never make it so
I guess I gotta prove that I'm the man
Treat me like your hobbie
And you're telling everybody
That you didn't really love me like that
I'm about to change my number
And I bet you're gon' wonder
Why I never ever called your ass back
You're gonna miss me
When my song's on the radio
You're gonna hate this fucking song
It goes like...
La da da da da da
You said you love me
la da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You gon' hate this fucking song
I don't think you get it but
I meant it when I said it
That you're never gonna get a second try
You said I was a zero
But I'm gonna be a hero
And I hit the red button every time
You're gonna miss me
When my song's on the radio
You're gonna miss me
When I'm gone
I just can't wait until you
Hear me on the stereo
You're gonna hate this fucking song
It goes like.
La da da da da da
You said you love me
la da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You gon' hate this fucking song
You told me I was gon' flop baby
And get a job baby
And I was never gonna live in my dreams
had none of my songs
All you had was Adam Levine's
So baby don't despair
Cuz I see you
When you show up
At my shows
You screwed up
Cuz I blew up
And you blow up my phone
(That's karma)
I just can't wait until you
Hear me on the stereo
You're gonna hate this fucking song
It goes like.
La da da da da da
You said you love me
La da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You gon' hate this fucking song
La da da da da da
You said you love me
la da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You gon' hate this fucking song
