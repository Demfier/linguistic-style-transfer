Said it a million times, I hate to see cryin.
I'd give a million lives to see you smilin'.
If it were you and I stuck on an island
think I'd be smiling.

Yo, if it were just you and I play the best of Bob Marley, no woman no cry
I make a guitar out of palm trees in case you crash-landed and you couldn't find your iPod
Make a wish upon a starfish, kiss under the waterfall, coconut sidedish, like paradise lost, but now I'm found.

Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away,
Everytime I get a little bit closer you leave me right here.
Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away,
Everytime I get a little bit closer you leave me right here.
Like an island in the sun, I'm waiting patiently, waiting for you, to land on me.
Like an island in the sun, I guess I wait and see, waiting for you, to land on me.

Collecting seashells on the seafloor
Smoke a lil' seaweed on the seashore
Just me and you, we don't need more
Except the sun and the stars and the wind and the mountains
See I'm a real hippie kid so just the two us is something I could dig
Building castles in the sky, building castles in the sky

Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away,
Everytime I get a little bit closer you leave me right here.
Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift and drift and drift,
Everytime I get a little bit closer you leave me right here.
Like an island in the sun, I'm waiting patiently, waiting for you, to land on me.
Like an island in the sun, I guess I wait and see, waiting for you, to land on me.

Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away,
Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away,
Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away,
Everytime I get a little bit closer you leave me right here.

Just steer the boat, but I dont know where to go, my compass is broke, lost in babylon a long time a go
Everytime I get a little bit closer you drift so far away, aah oooh yeah
Baby baby baby baby baby I'm a lonely one

Like an island in the sun, I'm waiting patiently, waiting for you, to land on me.
Like an island in the sun, I guess I wait and see, waiting for you, to land on me.
Like an island in the sun, I'm waiting patiently, waiting for you, to land on me.
Like an island in the sun, I guess I wait and see, waiting for you, to land on me.
