My mother told me I should go and get some therapy\n I asked the doctor can you find out what is wrong with me\n I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet\n I can't control it\n Yeah  I know it's taking over me\n I'm going crazy\n Can't contain it\n So tell me just what I should do\n She said  hey  it's alright\n Does it make you feel alive \n Don't look back\n Live your life\n Even if it's only for tonight\n She said  hey  it's alright\n If it makes you feel alive\n Went to a party  just after the doctor talked to me\n I met a girl  I took her  end up to the balcony\n I whisper something in her ear that I just can't repeat\n She said okay  but she was worried what her friends will think\n She's going crazy\n Can't contain it\n She asked what should I do \n I said  hey  it's alright\n Does it make you feel alive \n Don't look back\n Live your life\n Even if it's only for tonight\n I said  hey  it's alright\n If it makes you feel alive\n We got to live before we get older\n Do what we like\n We got nothing to lose\n Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders\n We got nothing to prove\n I said  hey  it's alright\n Does it make you feel alive \n Don't look back\n Live your life\n Even if it's only for tonight\n I said  hey  it's alright\n Does it make you feel alive \n Don't look back\n Live your life\n Even if it's only for tonight\n I said  hey  it's alright\n If it makes you feel alive
