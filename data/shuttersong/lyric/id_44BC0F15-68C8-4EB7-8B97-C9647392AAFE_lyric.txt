"All I Want For Christmas Is You"
(originally by Mariah Carey)

[Normani:]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need

[Lauren:]
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

[Ally:]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

[Camila:]
Make my wish come true

[Dinah:]
All I want for Christmas is you

[Ally:]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

[Camila:]
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Dinah:]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

[Ally:]
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

[Normani:]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow

[Ally:]
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

[Lauren:]
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

[Camila:]
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Dinah:]
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby

[All:]
All I want for Christmas is you

[Dinah:]
You baby

[Ally:]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

[Dinah:]
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing

[Ally:]
Santa, won't you bring me the one that I
Really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Lauren:]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for

[Ally:]
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Camila:]
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

[Dinah:]
Make my wish come true, baby

[Ally:]
All I want for Christmas is you, you

[All:]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
