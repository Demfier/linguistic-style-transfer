"Rock Star"

[VERSE 1]
Sometimes I walk a little faster
In the school hallway
Just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra
Time in the morning
Just to impress you

[PRE 1]
Guess you don't notice
Guess you don't need this
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

[CHORUS 1]
I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rock star

[VERSE 2]
Sometimes I wish when the phone rings
That it would be you
Saying let's hang out
Then you confess
That there's something special between us
Why don't we find out

[PRE 2]
you don't even know me
Guess you don't need me
Why you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

[CHORUS]
I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a...

[BRIDGE]
...rock star
If you only knew the real me
I might even be a rock star
I'm telling you that we are meant to be
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see
That I really am a rock star

[CHORUS]
I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
Rocking it where ever we are
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I really am a rock star!
(Yeah I really am a rock star)

I am a rock star
Whoa whoa whoa

Good night everybody!
