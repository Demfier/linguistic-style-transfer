You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

It began when I was 21 years old
And my mom and dad were begging me to go
So I left a note and we went and
hit the road
Me and Chris and all the stuff I own

I went out to find my soul and
left the only comfort that I'd known
It wasn't bout a good leaving
California bleeding
It was all about me choosing where to go

And I sang
You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

There were years I felt like
Everything was new
Long before the troubles of my youth
There were days and nights I
Couldn't see the end
And I swear the music was
My only friend

You learn a lot about forgiveness
When you choose to let down all your pride
Oh, oh
I don't wanna be so famous
I just wanna sing until I die

So singin
You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

When I wish upon a star
No telling I'd walk out this far

It came when I learned
How to face myself
And I'm still deciding
if I'm something else
I'm a million different people all the time
But there's only one of me
To get it right

(Get it right)

You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Het what you deserve

You are
Never gonna get (never gonna get)
Everything you want in this world (oh)
First things first
Get what you deserve (first things first)

You are
Never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
Oh
