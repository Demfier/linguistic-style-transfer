You kept all the thing I threw away
A leaf I picked, a birthday card I made
Holding on to memories of you and me
We didn't last a year
We're just a box of souvenirs

'Cause

Maybe
I pulled the panic cord
And maybe
You were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maby I'm the one to blame

This ment more to you than it did to me
I was full of doubt and you believed
The more that you keep coming over
The more I know it's over, dear
We're just a box of souvenirs

And

Maybe
I pulled the panic cord
And maybe
You were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maby I'm the one to blame

Maybe
You were just to nice to me
And mabye
It took me way to long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame

Do re mi fa so la ti do

That's the way the story goes

Do re mi fa so la ti do

That's the way the story goes

Maybe
I pulled the panic cord
And maybe
You were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maby I'm the one to blame

Maybe
You were just to nice to me
And mabye
It took me way to long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame
