I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen

You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before my eyes, then it hit me
You're relocating and I need you by my side

It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen


Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen
(Woah, now love)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen
(I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen
(But now I see your tears are an omen)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen
(Now I see your tears are an omen)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen
