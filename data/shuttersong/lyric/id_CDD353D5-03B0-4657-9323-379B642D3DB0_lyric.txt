Straight up this love is like a blessing from above
Baby girl you know we go together like Hand and Glove
'cause girl I'm always 'bout to see you
Said it's Shaggy and Ne-Yo

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I know when it's you girl, you girl
Sunshine and the flowers, jealous of the power
Of you girl, you girl
Reason that my heart beats we hit the bed but no sleep
Ooo girl, ooo girl
Body like a blessing say amen when you undress in front of me
Oo wee oo wee
I would happily call you the better half of me

[Shaggy:]
Good lovin' wake me up in the morning
Make it right before the lights up
Put on pressure when her body is calling
I make her face light up,
Mi get the rating from just how mi performing
She know I got the right touch
And she no stop request me daily
My one and only lady 'cause lately she knows that
I understand the body language you speaking
That physical attraction
The little things you do ya temperature peaking
I'm loving your dimensions
Well put together na?ve be to revealing
You've captured my attention
'cause girl you got the real thing
That on my bended knee thing
My feelings are so sure

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I know when it's you girl, you girl
Sunshine and the flowers, jealous of the power
Of you girl, you girl
