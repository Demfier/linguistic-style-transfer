All you tonight
Lift me up
All you tonight
Fill my cut
It's on you tonight
Get me through
All you tonight
All you

All you tonight
Lift me up
All you tonight
Fill my cut
It's on you tonight
Get me through
All you tonight
All you

All you tonight
Lift me up
All you tonight
Fill my cut
It's on you tonight
Get me through
All you tonight
All you

All you
You give me the love
My heart is fully beating
So alive at this moment
With the rhythm leading
All you
You look for the good
You find it, you make
So much that pulls us down
Extend a hand
I'll take it

All you tonight
Lift me up
All you tonight
Fill my cut
It's on you tonight
Get me through
All you tonight
All you

All you tonight
Lift me up
All you tonight
Fill my cut
It's on you tonight
Get me through
All you tonight
All you

All you tonight
Lift me up
All you tonight
Fill my cut
It's on you tonight
Get me through
All you tonight
All you

All you tonight
Lift me up

All you tonight

All you tonight

All you tonight
