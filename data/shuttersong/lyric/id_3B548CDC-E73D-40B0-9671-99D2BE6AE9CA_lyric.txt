Today I feel like running naked through your street
To get your attention
(Your attention)
Whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa-oh-oh)
I broke up with my girl so tell me where to meet
Oh, did I mention?
(Did I mention?)
Whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa-oh-oh)

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel alright?
Baby I don't want to see you cry, no-oh

I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Today I feel like blowing all my cash on you
I'd buy you anything
(Buy you anything)
Until I'm broke
(Until I'm broke broke)
Today I want to turn your skies from gray to blue
And if it rains on you
(If it rains)
I'll be your coat
Whoa-oh-oh

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel alright?
Baby, I don't want to see you cry, no-oh

I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Let me take your picture, baby
I'll save it for a rainy day
I don't need much
I guess I'm just old fashioned in that way
So on the count of three, let's see you
A 1, a 2, a 1, 2, a 1, 2, 3!

Smile
(I wanna make you smile yeah oh oh)
I wanna see you smile (oh yeah)
I wanna see you smile

It's the things you do
I wanna make you smile
