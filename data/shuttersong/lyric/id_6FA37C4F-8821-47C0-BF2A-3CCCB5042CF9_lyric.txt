Waiting for the night to implode
Anticipating drama I hope you know
A darker place where we can get together and rage
Easy, easy, easy
I hope you know I'm only
Teasing, teasing, teasing
And I just found another
Reason, reason, reason
For why you make me wanna scream

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I'm the only one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah
I'm a loaded gun
Something in a mirror made it easy to see
I'm just an idiot staring at me

Fall into the party
Make friends with everybody
Why so serious?
Aren't you dying to get lost?
Something tells me I can't be saved
I live my life on the edge
This is how I roll
When I feel invincible

Watching both my pupils dilate
Flashing lights and adverts I hate
Every single fucker inside the room
Come on, come on, come on
I don't understand the
Problem, problem, problem
I just want a little
Fun with fun with fun with
Everybody who plays

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I'm the only one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I'm a loaded gun
Something in a mirror made it easy to see
I'm just an idiot starting at me

Fall into the party
Make friends with everybody
Why so serious?
Aren't you dying to get lost?
Something tells me I can't be saved
I live my life on the edge
This is how I roll
When I feel invincible

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Waiting for the night to implode
Anticipating drama I hope you know
A darker place where we can get together and rage

Fall into the party
Make friends with everybody
Why so serious?
Aren't you dying to get lost?
Something tells me I can't be saved
I live my life on the edge
This is how I roll
When I feel invincible
