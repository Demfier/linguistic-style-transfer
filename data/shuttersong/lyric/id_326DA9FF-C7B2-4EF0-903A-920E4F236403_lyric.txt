I'm free to be whatever i
whatever i choose
and i'll sing the blues if i want

I'm free to say whatever i
whatever i like
if it's wrong or right it's alright

Always seems to me
you only see what people want you to see
how long's it gonna be.

before we get on the bus
and cause no fuss
get a grip on yourself
it don't cost much

Free to be whatever you
whatever you say
if it comes my way it's alright

You're free to be wherever you
wherever you please
you can shoot the breeze if you want

It always seems to me
you only see what people want you to see
how long's it gonna be

before we get on the bus
and cause no fuss
get a grip on yourself
it don't cost much
I'm free to be whatever i
whatever i choose
and i'll sing the blues if i want
Here in my mind
you know you might find
something that you
you thought you once knew
but now it's all gone
and you know it's no fun
yeah i know it's no fun
oh i know it's no fun
I'm free to be whatever i
whatever i choose
and i'll sing the blues if i want
I'm free to be whatever i
whatever i choose
and i'll sing the blues if i want
Whatever you do
whatever you say
yeah i know it's alright
Whatever you do
whatever you say
yeah i know it's alright
