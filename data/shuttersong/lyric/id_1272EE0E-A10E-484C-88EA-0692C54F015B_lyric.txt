Meet me out in Paris
I'll be on the elevator
Halfway up the Eiffel Tower
Halfway up to space
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout the desert, uh
We'll be riding through the thunder on a midnight train
And baby, wouldn't you say these are the best of our days?

They're gonna be out looking for us all night
And they got a search party with their big flashlights
And they're searching high, searching low, searching super wide
Ghetto choppers in the sky and they're flying super high
They're gonna be out looking for us all night
And they got a search party with their big flashlights
And they're searching high, searching low, searching super wide
Ghetto choppers in the sky and they're flying super high

Meet me out in Paris
I'll be on the elevator
Halfway up the Eiffel Tower
Halfway up to space
Jamaica, jumping over the equator, uh
While we underneath the water, we could ride the waves
So baby, let 'em chase us for the rest of our days

They're gonna be out looking for us all night
And they got a search party with their big flashlights
And they're searching high, searching low, searching super wide
Ghetto choppers in the sky and they're flying super high
They're gonna be out looking for us all night
And they got a search party with their big flashlights
And they're searching high, searching low, searching super wide
Ghetto choppers in the sky and they're flying super high

Boats and trains and cars and planes like
Boats and trains and cars and planes like
Oh, like oh
Saying "na na na na na, catch me if you can"
Fly guys and they find me in their clothes
Ain't no coming down, no, no, ain't no looking down
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
Na na na na na, catch me if you can

They're gonna be out looking for us all night
And they got a search party with their big flashlights
And they're searching high, searching low, searching super wide
Ghetto choppers in the sky and they're flying super high
They're gonna be out looking for us all night
And they got a search party with their big flashlights
And they're searching high, searching low, searching super wide
Ghetto choppers in the sky and they're flying super high

Be out all night
Search party, flashlights
Be out all night
Search party, flashlights
Be out all night
Search party, flashlights
Be out all night
Party
