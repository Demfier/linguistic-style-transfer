Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop this and let the whole world feel it
First thing's first I'm the realest
Drop this and let the whole world feel it
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down
Like I'm givin' lessons in physics
You should want a bad bitch like this
Drop it low and pick it up just like this
Cup of Ace cup of Goose
Cup of Cris
High heels somethin'
Worth a half a ticket on my wrist
Takin' all the liquor straight
Never chase that
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back
Bring the hooks in where the bass at
Champagne spillin' you should taste that
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop it low and pick
Drop drop it low and pick it up
Drop this and let the whole world feel it
Drop this and let the whole world feel it
I said baby I do this
I thought that you knew this
Can't stand no haters and honest the truth is
And my flow retarded
Each beat dear departed
Swagger on stupid
I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time
If it ain't 'bout money decline
And swear I meant that there so much
That I give that line a rewind
So get my money on time
If it ain't 'bout money decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters
Gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me who that who that
That do that do that
Put that paper over all
I thought you knew that knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y put my name in bold
I been working
I'm up in here with some change to throw
Who that who that
That do that do that
Put that paper over all
I thought you knew that knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y put my name in bold
I been working
I'm up in here with some change to throw
I'm so fancy you already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L A to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold
Remember my name
'Bout to blow-oh-oh-oh
Who that who that I-G-G-Y
That do that do that I-I-G-G-Y
Who that who that I-G-G-Y
Blow
Who that who that I-G-G-Y
That do that do that I-I-G-G-Y
Who that who that I-I-G-G-Y
Blow
Who that who that I-G-G-Y
That do that do that I-I-G-G-Y
Who that who that I-G-G-Y

That do that do that I-I-G-G-Y
Who that who that I-I-G-G-Y
