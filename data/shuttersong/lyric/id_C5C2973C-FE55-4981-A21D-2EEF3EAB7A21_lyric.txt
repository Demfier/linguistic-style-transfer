Go to bed you sleepy head
you'll be tired in the morning
Close your eyes and say goodnight to me
My side of the world is dark
as you begin to see the sun
But as your neighbors wake
you'll be falling fast asleep
It's goodbye until you wake up
until my atmosphere breaks up
With the moon falls the sun
when you're awake I'll be sleeping
But in my mind, you'll still be creeping
The only time that I'm with you is in my dreams

I want you to fall in love with me
I want to walk 1000 miles
just to lay down where you sleep
I don't want you just in my dreams
I wanna swim across the ocean
just to hear when your heart beats
And if you fall, for another soul
I hope he treats you like your perfect
And if he doesn't let me know
But no one will ever love you through and through.
I know this is true
No one will love you like I do

Rise and shine, I shield the sun.
the morning light has got me blind.
I never waste my time but these days are getting long
But I'll keep dreaming until I see you
until we are walking hand in hand.
And the world ends
or the oceans dry to land.
But it's goodbye until you wake up
until my shadow starts to break up
And dance away with lucid dreams
I hear your thoughts you must be thinking
We're wide away so let it sink in
no one can take you away from me

I want you to fall, in love with me
I want to walk 1000 miles
just to lay down where you sleep
I don't want you just in my dreams
I wanna swim across the ocean
just to hear when your heart beats.
And if you fall for another soul
I hope he treats you like you're perfect
You know I'd treat you like you're gold
But no one will ever love you through and through
I know this is true
No one will love you like I do
