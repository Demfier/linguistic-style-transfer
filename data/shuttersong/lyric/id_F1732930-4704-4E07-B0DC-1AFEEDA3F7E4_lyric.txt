Without Me - Eminem
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside round the outside
Guess who's back
Back again
shadys back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back guess who's back
Guess who's back guess who's back
Guess who's back guess who's back
Guess who's back eminem hums
I've created a monster
Cause nobody wants to see marshall no more
They want shady I'm chopped liver huh
Well if you want shady
This is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co operating
When I'm rockin the table
While he's operatin hey
You waited this long now stop debating
Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovu lating
I know that you got a job ms cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the fcc won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They try to shut me down on mtv
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip rum on your lips
Fuck that cum on your lips
And some on your tits
And get ready
Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits'
Fuck you debbie
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
Little hellions kids feelin rebellious
Embarrassed their parents
Still listen to elvis
They start feelin like prisoners helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission
And yells bitch
A visionary vision of scary
Could start a revolution
Pollutin the airwaves
A rebel so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone
Kissin my ass smak
And it's a disaster such a castastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me
Well I'm back na na na na na na na na na na
Bzzt fix your damn antenna tune it in
And then I'm gonna
Enter in in the front of your skin
Like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting the best thing since wrestling
Investing in your kid's ears and nesting
Bzzt testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents my two cents is free
A nuisance who sent you sent for me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
A tisket a tasket I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking this shit that shit
Chris kirkpatrick
You can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little limp bizket bastards
And moby you can get stomped by obie
You thirty six year old baldheaded fag
Blow me
You don't know me you're too old let go
It's over nobody listen to techno
Now let's go just gimme the signal
I'll be there
With a whole list full of new insults
I been dope suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since prince turned himself
Into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm dis gus ting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since elvis presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
Hey  there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
