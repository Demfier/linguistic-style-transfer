The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone) - U2

I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream
Before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere new
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectors that we had to see
Yeah  I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise 
Above the herd
I was young  not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you  brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment
When the miracle occurred
Heard a song
That made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
We've got language so we can communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name
I was young  not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you  brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment
When the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some
Sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
We can hear  we can hear
We can hear  ooh
I woke up at the moment
When the miracle had come
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices
May some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
And your voices will be heard
And your voices will be heard
