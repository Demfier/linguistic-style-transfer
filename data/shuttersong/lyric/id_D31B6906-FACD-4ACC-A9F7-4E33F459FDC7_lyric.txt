She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one

Her mom calls me "love", her dad calls me "son", alright

I know, I know, I know for sure

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Na na (she belongs to me)

Kisses that queen, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright
I don't exist if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright

But I know, I know, I know for sure

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

She knows, she knows
That I never let her down before
She knows, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now

Everybody wants to steal my girl
Everybody wants to take her heart (love) away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
(Well) find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na (she belongs to me)
She belongs to me
