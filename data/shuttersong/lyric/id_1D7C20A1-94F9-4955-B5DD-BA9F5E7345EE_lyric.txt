Ohhhhohhhohhhohhhh ladadadadada
Ohhhhohhhohhhohhhh ladadadadada
Ohhhhohhhohhhohhhh ladadadadada
Ohhhhohhhohhhohhhh

See it went from talking shit loud
Then graduating to whispers
Still chilling painting pictures with the hipsters
And since I produced the record
Please hold while I insert
A bassline dirtier than kissing on your sister (ew)
Still clearing 30 racks, cigarrettes, and leather jackets
Pimp coats, and feathered hats
Lose the phone, never that
My mother's cooking sauce
I'm more Italian than Sinatra's kids
Fashion is a chore to me
I'm partying in moccasins
Rocking with the scholars
Then taking shots up with the college kids
Please don't try and copy me
You're cheating while I'm proctoring
Positively optimistic
Hopping on the opposite
Of every single thing they ever told me to do
So put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds Jon Lennon would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spazz out

To sounds Jon Lennon would be proud-

Ohhh as I take off on an airplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true

Yeah I'm afraid of heights
But I'm not afraid to fly

Let me hear the dreamers yo
Ohhhhohhhohhhohhhh ladadadadada

Yeah, for a proper introduction
This is keys without the locksmith
A new year, I'm tired of rapping on that nonchalant tip
You scholars think you can roast my associate with hot shit
You're hopeless, cause this bachelor is a master when a doc spits
Work all day and laid back collecting bills at night
We're fly enough to make the sell see us, still we're fearing heights
Waiting to blow, getting impatient, i've been chasing
Mister myers with a knife
Flipping the script because I'm killing mic's
My entourage is a bunch of guys
Who walk around mauling all the moms in every mall
With that sharpened claws
Not talking santa or a certain type of grammar
I'm a standout
Not handing handouts to all your open paws

So put the hate down watch me spazz out
To sounds Kurtis Blow would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spazz out
Yo sounds Kurtis Blow would be proud-

Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
