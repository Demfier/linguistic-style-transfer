So I'm back to the Velvet Underground
Back to the floor that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

Do-do-do-do

And it all comes down to you
Well, you know that it does, well
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
She faces freedom
With a little fear
I have no fear
I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from you now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And her memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy, ooh-ooh
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

(Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you)
Ooh, oh
And it all comes down to you
(Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you)
Oh
I still see your, your bright eyes, bright eyes
(And it all comes down to you)
