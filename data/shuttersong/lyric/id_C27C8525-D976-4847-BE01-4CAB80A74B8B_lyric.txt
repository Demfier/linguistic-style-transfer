 the worth before you ride with me 
Put that man aside if he's all about bein'  with someone just to get inside 
Or if he's hopin' and prayin' that  you gon' stay when he gets caught 
When he slips up, fightin', pullin' all sorts and types of straws 
Now  the jig's up, left broken in pieces like a jigsaw 
But that's just how shit goes 
When  you let  the shallow love get hope 
Girl I just wanna know 
Is this shallow love? 
Or is it something real? 
 You make it hard to deal 
Not knowin' if this is shallow love 
 The way we live so well 
Can make it hard to tell 
What  you in it for? 
What  you really in it for? 
Nowadays these girls be so ruthless 
2 A.M. knockin' on my front door, who's this? 
Girl I don't even know your name 
This ain't  the time yo 
Oh my God this is so insane 
Like I ain't even got your number saved in my iPhone 
Is this shallow love? 
Or is it something real? 
 You make it hard to deal 
Not knowin' if this is shallow love 
 The way we live so well 
Can make it so hard to tell 
What  you in it for? 
What  you really in it for?
