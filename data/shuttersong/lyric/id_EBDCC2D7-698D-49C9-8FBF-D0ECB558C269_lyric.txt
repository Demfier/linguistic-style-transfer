Everybody loves to tell me
I was born an old soul

Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so all alone
I think about my grandad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
I gotta make him proud
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken

I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'd miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know

I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
My eyes wide open

Yeah, All I have is just this moment
And I don't wanna miss a second
'Cause you could all be gone in an instant
Yeah, in an instant
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken (open)

I'm about to make my way (make my way)
Heaven help me keep my faith
My eyes wide open
(I keep my eyes wide open) I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith, (my eyes wide open)
I keep my eyes wide open
