Mean concrete got you walkin' to a place you know
You gonn' meet your maker when he hands you dough
Late night creature go a walkin' with her
head hung low
All her features are a talkin'
but'a she don't know
she don't know...

High heels clingin'on a pavement streets a glow
hips are swaggerin' and achin' to and fro
she don't need no education
when the streets are mean
he done seen a revelation now
in her jeans
but she don't know...

How easy it is to make a dollar
when a man gonna give you his wages
just to make him scream and holler
with a number left, left in the pages
but she don't know...
