Smoke in my lungs
I won't disguise this place
sound travels through me
as I twist on my fate
chilled to my bones, I
need your heart, my own
deep down inside
is where the fire hides
follow and forget
chaos and she's in bed
dream out the sleep
that give you your strength
I don't need that, I
I need to feel us rise
beneath the lights, we
will burn out twice
and oh
ain't never gonna run from you now
there's cold
white skin on the ground
and we'll go go go from here
Alone I go
the morning glow give me
connect her thunder
love that just won't--
but it become me
somethings I just don't feel
burns on the sun
this one that you don't see
you don't see
and oh
ain't never gonna run from you now
there's cold
white skin on the ground
we'll go go go from here
let's go go go from here
let's go go go from here
