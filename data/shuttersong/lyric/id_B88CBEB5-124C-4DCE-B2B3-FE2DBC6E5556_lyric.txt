Believe me, I could live without you 
But I really don't want to 
Believe me, I could love without you 
But I really don't need to 
Cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do 
But being left is hard, oh yes, it's true 
But try coming back 
How do I get back to you, to you, to you? 
How can I get back to you? 
Let me get back to you 
But I don't wanna face it 
All this time that I wasted It's so close, 
I can taste it 
How can I get back to you?
