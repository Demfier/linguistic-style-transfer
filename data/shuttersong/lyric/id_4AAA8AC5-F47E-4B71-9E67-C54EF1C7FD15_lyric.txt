I was lost, now I'm found
Was sustained by the sound
By the angels singing me to sleep
Now my feet are leaving the ground.
Am I dead or am I dreaming instead?
A cornucopia of opiates are flooding my head.

I'm insane, I am smart
All it takes is a spark to ignite my bad intentions
And to what I do best to your heart
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves.
Now the moon hates its full, so you know I wont play by the rules.

I will never spill!
Spill my blood for you.
You have let me down
One too many times!

Some way, somehow, we're falling out
Caught in-between my enemies!
No way, not now, I won't back down.
I draw the line at you and me!
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me.

Due to mistakes that I have made to this day
I am trapped inside a dillinger
diligently of thinking of ways to get out of this god awful place.
I just learned that my fate is something I cannot escape so
Sound the alarms, we were dead from the start.
It's a never ending system
Break me down, tear me apart.
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves.
Now the moon hates its full, so you know I wont play by the rules.

I will never spill!
Spill my blood for you.
You have let me down
One to many times!

Some way, somehow we're falling out
Caught in-between my enemies!
No way, not now, I won't back down.
I draw the line at you and me!
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me.

Oh! This is the end of you
This is where I draw the line.
And I won't lose.
This war is mine.

Spill my blood for you
One too many times.
Some way, somehow we're falling out
Caught in-between my enemies!
No way, not now, I won't back down.
I draw the line at you and me!
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me.
It was always me!
