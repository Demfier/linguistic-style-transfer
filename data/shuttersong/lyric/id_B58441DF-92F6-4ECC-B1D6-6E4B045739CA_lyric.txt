In a dark room we fight, make up for our love.
I've been thinking, thinking 'bout you, about us.
And we're moving slow, our hearts beat so fast.
I've been dreaming, dreaming 'bout you, about us.

Hey, hey, hey, hey
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh

I was speaking soft, see the pain in your eyes
I've been feeling, feeling for you, my love.
And our bodies are tired, our shadows will dance
I've been aching, aching for you, my love.

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head

My love is wasted, sorry for this
I never meant to be, hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me
I have trouble, understanding myself, understanding myself
And my love is wasted, sorry for this
I never meant to be, hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me
I have trouble, understanding myself, understanding myself

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head
Oh oh oh oh oh...
