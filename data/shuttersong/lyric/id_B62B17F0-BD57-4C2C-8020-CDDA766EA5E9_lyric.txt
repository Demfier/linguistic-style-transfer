If you wanna leave me baby
Leave some morphine at my door
Cuz it would take a whole lot of medication
To realise what we used to have it
But we don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how my knees are on the floor
So keep in mind all the sacrifices i'm making
To keep you by my sideand keep you from walking out the door

Cuz there'll be no sunlight, if i lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies, if i lose you baby
Just like the clouds my eyes would do the same
If you walk away, every day will rain, rain, rain

I'll never be your mothers favourite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
if i was in their shoes id be doing the same thing
Say there goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy
But that's just the part of something they can't understand
But little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah for you, i'll try, i'll try, i'll try, i'll try

I'll pick up these broken pieces till i'm bleeding if that'll make it right
Cuz there'll be no sunlight, if i lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies, if i lose you baby
Just like the clouds my eyes would do the same
If you walk away, everything will rain, rain, rain

Don't you say, goodbye
Don't you say, goodbye

I'll pick up these broken pieces till i'm bleeding if that'll make it right
Cuz there'll be no sunlight, if i lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies, if i lose you baby
Just like the clouds pass, i would do the same
If you walk away, everything will rain, rain, rain
