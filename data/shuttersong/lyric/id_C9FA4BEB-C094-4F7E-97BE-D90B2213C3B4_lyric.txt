I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kind of boring
Need something that I can confess

Till all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by, it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no, I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics never jumped in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we were chasing all those stars
Whose driver shining big black cars

And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Sitting straight, too low
And I don't really like my flow, oh, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics never jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Got no reason
Got no shame
Got no family
I can blame
Just don't let me disappear
I'mma tell you everything

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics never jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll like those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics never jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
All my secrets away
