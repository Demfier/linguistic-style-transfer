Hey, a casual affair
That could go anywhere
And only for tonight

Take any moment, any time
A lover on the left
A sinner on the right

[Chorus:]
Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush, hush, don't say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair, whoa!

Break involuntary ties
A secret so the spies
Could never find us out

Stay for as long as you have time
So the mess that we'll become
Leaves something to talk about

[Chorus:]
Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush, hush don't say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair, whoa!

I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it...
I did it again
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it...
I did it again
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it...
I did it again
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it...
I did it again

[Chorus:]
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush, hush don't say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair, whoa!
