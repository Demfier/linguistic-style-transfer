Let's hit the road and the way to go
Take a new direction to a different coast
Maybe we should try and put it on the line
You gotta trust me now, turn up the radio
To know the worlds and roll with the melody
Baby, listen close and open up your mind

Imagine it, anywhere
More than miles, I'll take you there
Knew one day, from the start
We'll be as one, now here we are

All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen

Listen, all we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen

Sounds are like in the wind
Like puzzling violins
I can be your rhythm in the silence
Every time we sing, it echoes in the sky
Let me close your eyes, help you fantasize
Make a kiss our playlist in entire night
Listen to the words as I let them fly

Imagine it, anywhere
More than miles, I'll take you there
Knew one day, from the start
We'll be as one, now here we are

All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen

Listen, all we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen

Listen, all we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
