Hello, where have you been? You're about to miss it all
I would give anything to hear you call, if I'm honest
Sometimes, it's all that I can do to keep my head up high.
I'm like a book with empty pages inside.
Cold wind blowing through the window shade. I'm calling what else can I say?
I'm like a billboard in the sky.
How many times you've passed me by, you've passed me by?
You're like a blinking neon light,
How many times I've bought your lies? Sometimes I wonder why, if I'm honest.
My life, it's not as easy as I make you think I close my eyes and I try not to blink, if I'm honest
Cold wind blowing through the window shade. Fallin' faster each and every day.
I'm like a billboard in the sky.
How many times you've passed me by, you've passed me by?
You're like a blinking neon light,
How many times I've bought your lies? Sometimes I wonder why…
Come back, come back,
Please don't leave me all alone,
Come back, come back,
I'm right here,
Come back, come back I'm willing if you are…
I'm like a billboard in the sky
