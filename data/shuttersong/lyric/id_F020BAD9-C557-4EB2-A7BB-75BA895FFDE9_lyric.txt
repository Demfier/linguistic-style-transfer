We flew too close to the sun
So close I thought it was heaven
If hell is a life without love
Am I being punished for what I've done?

The sky's on fire
All the stars disappear
No signs
Of life
Without you here

Tears will fall
Oceans will rise
The earth will stop turning
Since you left
Every breath

Feels like it's burning
I know that life will go on
I will survive
But for tonight
I swear on my life
This is the End Of The World.

Slept on your side of the bed
Replayed the things that I should've said
Wish I had summoned the strength
To leave alone what I couldn't change

The sky's on fire
All the world disappears
No signs
Of life
Without you here

(Yeah)

Tears will fall
Oceans will rise
The earth will stop turning
Since you left every breath

Feels like it's burning
I know that life will go on
I will survive
But for tonight
I swear on my life
This is the End Of The World.

The sky's on fire

Tears will fall
Oceans will rise

Since you left every breath
Feels like its burning
I know that life! Will go on
I'll survived
But for tonight
I swear on my life
This is the End Of The World.
