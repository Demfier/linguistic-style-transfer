Man I swear to God this life we LIVE is far from average
I'm havin' a blast even when I'm stuck in LA traffic
Now I never give a shit about the haters or the has-beens

The places we travelin' make you think you're trippin' acid
Cause the views are so amazin' when you're flyin' overseas
If you say my shit ain't fire, watch me heighten my degrees
Man the way we eatin' good, gotta floss every day
And my team, we so hot, we're never not in the shade
We're never not gettin' paid, we're makin' MONEY as we toss and turn
But at the end of the day, it don't matter what you earn
Raised up on 101st street
PARENTS told me never let the MONEY be the motivation, gon' and spread your word
So I'ma spread it, I'ma spread it like my wings
And you never know, tomorrow might not end up happening
So I keep it movin', got my foot on the gas
LIFE'S better when you're livin' it fast, man that's a fact

Top down, and we PCH
Malibu with that purple haze
Ain't 21 but we pop champagne all night
That's just how we livin', we livin'
That's just how we livin', we livin'
Every day I'm wakin' up, I'm walkin' out the door
No I'm never lookin' back, I'm always goin' with the flow
Cause that's just how we livin', we livin'

Back in high school my parents told me I stayed up too late
But now we're livin' on our own and they ain't got no say
Out here in the Golden State, sun's out, it's a gorgeous day
House up in the hills, that's the place where all the homies stay
Damn... no turnin' back
Two kids named Jack and we burnin' a sack
Yeah I sing and I rap, and they clap
Sellin' out shows, put the O on the map
Yeah that's Omaha, Nebraska, for it, yeah we hold it down
Hot on the West Coast, still gotta rep though
Starin' at my ceiling as I'm layin' on my couch, in my house
...Damn, dude, like we got a house
That shit is fresh, yo
Seein' as how a year ago we in class
Fillin' up college apps, goin' home, takin' a nap
Now we sellin' tracks and rushin' out, rushin' a frat
Life's better when you're livin' it fast, man that's a fact

Top down, and we PCH
Malibu with that purple haze
Ain't 21 but we pop champagne all night
That's just how we livin', we livin'
That's just how we livin', we livin'
Every day I'm wakin' up, I'm walkin' out the door
No I'm never lookin' back, I'm always goin' with the flow
Cause that's just how we livin', we livin'

Full tank of gas
No obligations
We're makin' this last
Life is just one big vacation
Full tank of gas
No obligations
We're makin' this last
Life is just one big vacation

That's just how we livin', we livin'
That's just how we livin', we livin'
Every day I'm wakin' up, I'm walkin' out the door
No I'm never lookin' back, I'm always goin' with the flow
Cause that's just how we livin', we livin'
That's just how we livin', we livin'
That's just how we livin', we livin'
Every day I'm wakin' up, I'm walkin' out the door
No I'm never lookin' back, I'm always goin' with the flow
Cause that's just how we livin', we livin'
