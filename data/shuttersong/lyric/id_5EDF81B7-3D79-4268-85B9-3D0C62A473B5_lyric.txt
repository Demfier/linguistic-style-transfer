Here I am waiting, I have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along, how did it come so fast?

This our last night, but is late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Whoa whoa whoa

Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting by and the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

This is way too hard, 'cause I know
When the sun comes up, I will leave
This is my last glance
That will soon be memory

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Whoa whoa whoa

I never wanted to stop because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark but now is all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Whoa whoa whoa
