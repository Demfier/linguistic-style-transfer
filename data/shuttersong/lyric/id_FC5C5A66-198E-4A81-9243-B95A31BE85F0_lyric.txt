I'm not in this universe
My body's stuck in reverse
My lungs are always short of breath
You see these tracks you know the rest
My face is skuffed, my eyes are black

Where's the point where I turn back
And I can't help but think that this isn't me
But maybe they're right
Maybe this is all a lie

And I followed a sign that brought me to my life as I know it
And I can't find myself 'cause
You've taken control of my heart and my soul
Tried to call but your phone's disconnected

Girl you know that I can not accept this
Now I'm stuck in my head
While you lie in your bed
Tryin' to sleep just to forget my name

Tryin' to sleep just to block out the pain
Born to believe what the world gave to me was everything that I'd ever be
As we're lifted up high
These thoughts have arrived to bring back some sense to our dwindling minds
And so it goes the years fly by

The more regrets the less I try
I just might die

And I can't help but think that this isn't me
But maybe they're right
Maybe this is all a lie
You've taken control of my heart and my soul

Tried to call but your phone's disconnected
Girl you know that I can not accept this
Now I'm stuck in my head
While you lie in your bed

Tryin' to sleep just to forget my name

Tryin' to sleep just to block out the pain
Don't wanna feel this pain anymore
I'm not in this universe
My body's stuck in reverse
My lungs are always short of breath

You see these tracks you know the rest
My face is skuffed, my eyes are black
Where's the point where I turn back
You've taken control of my heart and my soul
Tried to call but your phone's disconnected
Girl you know that I can not accept this
Now I'm stuck in my head
While you lie in your bed
Tryin' to sleep just to forget my name
Tryin' to sleep just to block out the pain
