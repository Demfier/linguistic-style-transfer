Sirens - Cher Lloyd
I carry the weight of you in my heavy heart
And the wind is so icy  I am numb
I carry the weight of you heading back to start
With the thousand eyes on me
I stumble on
I am tired of growing older
I'm getting weaker everyday  yeah
I carry the weight of you
I carry the weight of you
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on a steel
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me with the silver lightning stays until
The sirens' calling
I follow the sun down north and I think of night
And you hold so tightly  it's hard to breath
And I'm tired of growing older
I'm getting weaker everyday  yeah
I follow the sun down low
I follow the sun down low
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on a steel
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me with the silver lightning stays until
The sirens' calling
The sirens' calling
Yeah I'm tired  I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker everyday
I am drowning  and you're stealing every breath
Take me away and just
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on a steel
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me with the silver lightning stays until
The sirens' calling
The sirens' calling
