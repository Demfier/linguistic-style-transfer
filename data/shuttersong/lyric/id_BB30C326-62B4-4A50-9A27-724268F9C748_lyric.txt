First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled, Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville

Talk to a nigga
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes

Lame niggas can't tell the difference

One time for a nigga who knows
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her

She don't wanna be saved
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her \
