I know you've got a strong heart
It's written in the stars
Behind the castle walls
You've hid your light
But when you let the past go
Your story unfolds
Look out your window
Into the night

The darkness can be such a lonely place on your own
I'll be your compass so you'll never feel alone

Don't wait for the world to be ready
Who says you can't explore
Who says you can't explore
Don't wait for the world to be ready
Find what you're looking for
Find what you're looking for

Are the monsters in your head now?
Stare them all down
If they come back around
You'll be alright
And when the journey gets tough
Just know that you're enough
You're like a warrior
Keep up the fight

The darkness can be such a lonely place on your own
I'll be your compass so you'll never feel alone

Don't wait for the world to be ready
Who says you can't explore
Who says you can't explore
Don't wait for the world to be ready
Find what you're looking for
Find what you're looking for

Don't don't don't wait
Don't you wait, no
Don't don't don't wait

Don't don't don't wait
Don't you wait, no
Don't don't don't wait

Don't wait for the world to be ready
Who says you can't explore
Don't wait for the world to be ready
Find what you're looking for
Find what you're looking for
Don't wait for the world to be ready
Who says you can't explore
Who says you can't explore
Don't wait for the world to be ready
Find what you're looking for
Find what you're looking for
