Oh yeah!
Shoot that bazooka, big barracuda
I see the hunger in your eyes
I don't need you to spend all your gouda
Might as well throw it in the fire

But you gotta work, work like you own it
'Cause you gotta play, play, play your part
Boy if you want love you better know
The way to my body's through my heart

I got the keys to the kingdom now
They chingaling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
But who got the keys, who got the keys, oh!
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They chingaling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
'Cause I got the keys to the kingdom now

Chingalinga, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat
Chingalinga, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat

My Lamborghini don't need no car keys
To open them butterfly doors
Not tryna' be cocky, no Ricky Bobby
I'm not used to going slow, no

But you gotta work, work like you own it
'Cause you gotta play, play, play your part
Boy if you want love you better know
The way to my body's through my heart

I got the keys to the kingdom now
They chingaling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
But who got the keys, who got the keys, oh!
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They chingaling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
'Cause I got the keys to the kingdom now

Chingalinga, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat

Won't you let me, won't you let me in
'Cause I'm a knock you down
If I let you in, if I let you
If I let you in, would you love me now

You got no reason to be lonely, girl
Won't you let me in, won't you let me in
Won't you let me in, won't you let me in
And watch me I get down

They chingaling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
'Cause I got the keys to the kingdom now

They chingaling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
But who got the keys, who got the keys, oh!

They chingaling with my chain hanged down
My golden gates got the boys locked down
