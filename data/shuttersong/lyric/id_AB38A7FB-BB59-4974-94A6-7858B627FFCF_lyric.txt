Somewhere Over The Rainbow
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that
I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare
To dream really do come true
Someday i'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away beyond the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't i
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away beyond the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't i
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't i
