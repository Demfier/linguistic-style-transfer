I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And thats where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly.

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say, hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

Na na, na na na nah na na
Na na, na na na nah na na
Na na, na na na nah na na
Na na, na na na nah na na

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say hello.

Na na, na na na nah na na
Na na, na na na nah na na
Hello, hello
Na na, na na na nah na na
Na na, na na na nah na na
Hello, hello

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
