No, one knows what it's like?
Behind these eyes
Behind this mask
I wish we could rewind
And turn back time to correct the past

Oh! Baby I wish I could tell you
How I fell but I can't
Cause I'm scared to
Oh! Boy I wish I could say that

Underneath it all.
I'm still the one you love
Still the one you're dreaming of
Underneath it all.
I'm missing you so much
Baby let's not give it up

I don't wanna give this up
So, I'm putting on a show
Cause what we have is true
And I don't want to let it go
I know that you feel in love
Even if you can't see

I know one day you will discover
Underneath it's me
Oh! Baby I wish I could tell you

How I fell but I can't
Cause I'm scared to
Oh! Boy I wish I could say that
Underneath it all.
I'm still the one you love
Still the one you're dreaming of
Underneath it all.
I'm missing you so much
Baby let's not give it up
Let's not give it up...
