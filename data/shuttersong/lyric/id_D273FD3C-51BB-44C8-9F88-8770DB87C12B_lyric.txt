My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground, and it feels like

I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around

I'm slowly drifting away

I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning

Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the
uhhh wave. (drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away) x2

I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach
To find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say

I'm slowly drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
