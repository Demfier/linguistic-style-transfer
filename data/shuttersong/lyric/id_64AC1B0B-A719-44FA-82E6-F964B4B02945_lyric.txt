We gotta straight and after deal
It's time to give me something real
You'd better put your toys away
You know that I'm not here to play

Something strange is in your eye
I don't know what you're seeing
In your mind
Today I've got to know
Why you've been stolen (stolen)
All the time
It's me or do you lie?
I don't know who you're seeing
On the sly
Today I've got to know
Who you've been calling (calling)
Did you Sly?

You gotta put it on the line
Not just a nickel or a dime
You'd better hear the words I say

You know that I'm not here to play
Something strange is in your eye
I don't know what you're seeing
In your mind
Today I've got to know
Why you've been stolen (stolen)
All the time
It's me or do you lie?
I don't know who you're seeing
On the sly
Today I've got to know
Who you've been calling (calling)

Did you Sly?
