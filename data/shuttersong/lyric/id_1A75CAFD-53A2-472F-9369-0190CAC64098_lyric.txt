A 1... 2...3
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
We gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feels so good, what's done now?

Let's make Christmas the whole year round
da da da da da da da da I don't care when snow stops falling down
Santa's come and gone, yeah he's left town
I don't need a Christmas tree
Mistletoe or red and green
All I need is you next to me
To make every night Christmas Eve
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
We gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing

We'll keep the whole world singing

Feels so good, what's done now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

da da da da da da da da When all those pretty lights have been put away

And old Rudolph is gone on holiday
Oh we'll keep that fire burning

Though the calendar is turning
Watch everyone pay you full
When we can have 364 more
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this

Feeling we're feeling now
We gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing

We'll keep the whole world singing
Feels so good, what's done now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round
I don't need a Christmas tree

Mistletoe or red and green
All I need is you next to me
To make every night Christmas Eve
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
We gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feels so good, what's done now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year
