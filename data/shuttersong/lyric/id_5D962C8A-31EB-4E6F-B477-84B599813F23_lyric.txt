Albert's always sincere, he's a sensitive type
His intentions are clear, he wanna be well-liked
If everything is nothing, then are we anything?
Is it better to be better than to be anything?
And Albert's vision is blooming uncontrolled
All his wings are slowly sinking
The world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
All the king's men reappear
For an egg man, on and off the wall
Who'll never be together again
Einstein's down on the beach staring into the sand
'Cause everything he believes in is shattered
What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway
And we all get burned as
One more sun comes sliding down the sky
One more shadow leans against the wall
And the world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an egg man, on and off the wall
Who'll never be together again
Albert's waiting in the sun
On a field American
For the cause of some
Inflated form of hit and run
One more sun comes sliding down the sky
One more shadow leans against the wall
And the world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an egg man, fallin' off the wall
Will never be together again
Albert's fallen on the sun
Cracked his head wide open
The world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an egg man, falling, falling
The world begins to disappear
The worst things come from inside here
And all the king's men reappear
For an egg man, fallin' off the wall
Will never be together again
No never be together again
No no never, never, never again
What you fear in the night in the day
Comes to call anyway
Never, never, never again
No, no, no, no, no, no
