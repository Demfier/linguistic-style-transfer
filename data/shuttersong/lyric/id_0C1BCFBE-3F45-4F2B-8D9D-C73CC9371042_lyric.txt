Uuuu, there's something in your eyes
that makes me wanna LOVE YOU
There's something bout your vibe
And when the lights go down,
I see you moving CLOSER
So I can feel the heat whenever you're around
But the memories still won't fade
Of the times we tried

Oooh, something in the WAY WE ARE
If only we can make a star
But we only fall apart
Ooooh, baby we can try again
Make it go until THE END,
But now we only fall apart
But now we only fall apart

Oooh, something in the WAY WE ARE
Only we can make a STAR!!

Oooh, something in the WAY WE ARE
Only we can make a STAR!!
