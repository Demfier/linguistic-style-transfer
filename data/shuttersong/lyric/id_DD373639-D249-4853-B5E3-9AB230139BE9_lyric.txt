Your love is bright as ever

Even in the shadows

Baby kiss me

Before they turn the lights out

Your heart is glowing

And I'm crashing into you

Baby kiss me, kiss me

Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Oohhh, baby love me lights out
In the darkest night, I'll

I'll search through the crowd

Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby love me lights out
Baby love me lights out

We don't have forever

Baby daylight's wasting

You better kiss me

Before our time is run out

Nobody sees what we see

They're just hopelessly gazing

Oohhh, baby take me, take me

Before they turn the lights out
Before our time is run out
Oohhh, baby love me lights out
In the darkest night, I'll

I'll search through the crowd

Your face is all that i see
I'll give you everything
Baby love me lights out
Baby love me lights out
Oohhh, you can turn my lights out
I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me girl XO
You love me like XO
Is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby love me lights out
Baby love me lights out
You can turn my lights out
Oohhh, in the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby love me lights out
Baby love me lights out
Oohhh, you can turn my lights out
