This kitten got your tongue tied in knots I see

Spit it out cuz im dying for company
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level baby!

If you want this good shit
Sicker than the remix
Baby let me blow your mind tonight
I cant take it take it take no more

Never felt like felt like this before
C'mon get me get me on the floor
DJ whatcha whatcha waitin' for!?

Woah Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh

Woah Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh
Watch me move when I lose when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearing
I notice when you're staring

You know that I can take it to the next level baby

Hotter than the A-list
Next one on my hit list
Baby let me blow your mind tonight!
I can't take it take it take no more

Never felt like felt like this before
C'mon get me get me on the floor

DJ whatcha whatcha waitin' for.
Woah Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh
Woah Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh

Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends

Keep on daancing till the world ends
Keep on daancing till the world ends
Woah Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh
Woah Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh
See the sunlight
We aint stoppin'
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
(the world ends, the world ends...)
