A little bit of misfit dancing
A little bit of jojo dancing
A little bit of thoughts of mine
Coming out the mind of this midnight rambler
I can't wait til these tunes of mine get me out of this local jam
Let's get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am
Ever thank you if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show your life
Everything is gonna be alright
Clashing through the stars alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody that's right
We all got the spark we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark we're alright
We all got the spark we all got the spark tonight
They say if you look around
For something hard enough and you just might find it
And there's some around
Who wanna keep you down
But Shawty don't be blinded
Feeling trapped thinking
That you can't get out of this humdrum scene
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean
Everything that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cuz it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright
Clashing through the stars alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody that's right
We all got the spark we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark we're alright
We all got the spark we all got the spark tonight
I'mma feel this forever
Or ever if it's just tonight
Even when I close my eyes
Tell me keep myself from falling
Tryna get this thing right
I gotta do this more often
Well well maybe tonight
Clashing through the stars alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody that's right
We all got the spark we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
'Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark we're alright
We all got the spark we all got the spark tonight
