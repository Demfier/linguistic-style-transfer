Let's pretend baby
that you've just met me
and i've never seen you before

I'll tell all my friends
that i think you're staring
and you say the same to yours

And oh, we'll dance around it all night
and then i'll follow you outside
and try to open up my mouth and nothing comes out right

And I, I wanna fall in love with you again
I don't have to try
Its so easy who needs to pretend
But because, its so funny let's just think
about it honey
let's just fall in love again

I'll call you in three days
not too soon, not too late
and i'll ask your roommate if your home

ooh, oh

you'll call me on thursday
and we'll hang out all day
and fall asleep on the phone

and oh, i'll hold your hand when we drive
and we'll lost track of all the time
and we'll tell everyone that we ain't never felt so alive

And I, I wanna fall in love with you again
I don't have to try
Its so easy who needs to pretend
But because, its so funny let's just think
about it honey
let's just fall in love again

We'll fall disgustingly fast
And we'll stop hanging out with friends
and they'll be so offended
oh, ooh oh
And I, I wanna fall in love with you again
I don't have to try
Its so easy who needs to pretend
But because, its so funny let's just think
about it honey
let's just fall in love again
let's just fall in love again
so, let's just fall in love again
