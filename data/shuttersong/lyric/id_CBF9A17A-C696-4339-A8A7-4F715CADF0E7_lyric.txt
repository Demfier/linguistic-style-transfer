She fell into a summer night
Swell over a note saying 'shallow waters'
Wasn't even gonna come
Somehow had a need to see her under
She never saw it going down
How she'd lose perception of the order
He told her to go further down
(oh oh)

He never thought that she would jump
(oh oh)
Always had a wish to rise up under
He told her to go further down
(oh oh)
Let into the weight- she touched the border
Stroke the bottom with her hands
(oh oh)
Finally she felt like she was flying
He told her to go further down
(oh oh)

With my hands before my eyes
I give away my sight
When the colours start to fade
The waters wash away

And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)
And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)
And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)
And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)

(...)

(oh oh)
She gave her days for his night
Bit by bit she lost where it was going
He told her to go further down
Let into the weight- she touched the border
Stroke the bottom with her hands
(oh oh)
Finally she felt like she was rising
He told her to go further down
(oh oh)

With my hands before my eyes
I give away my sight
When the colours start to fade
The waters wash away

And the river comes and takes me
And the river comes and takes me

And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)
And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)
And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)
And the river comes and takes me
(oh oh)

With my hands before my eyes
I give away my sight
As the colours start to fade
The waters wash away
And the river comes
