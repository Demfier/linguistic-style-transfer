I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies and they cut so deeply

You can't get enough
You take and take and take
And never say NO

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NO!

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout
Blood in your eye

You say that it's not your fault
And said that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run to the back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough
You take and take and take and take and take
And never say
NO!

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NO!

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NO!

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
NO!
You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout
Blood in your eye

(Hahahahahaha)
His lost his mind
He never did this before
Tonight he gone completly crazy
Away, away, away, away.
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

NO!

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down

NO!

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down

NO!

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down

NO!

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout
Blood in your eye.
