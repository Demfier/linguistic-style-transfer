I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
Youve been starring in my dreams
Lord I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
Hey, what's the matter man?
Were gonna come around at twelve

With some puerto rican girls

that are just dyin to meet you.

Were gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around

You know, like we used to
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Oh everybody waits so long

Oh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come on! come on!
I've been walking in central park

Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people
what's the matter with you boy?
Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
I wont miss you child
I guess Im lying to myself
Its just you and no one else
Lord I won't miss you child
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
