In Common - Alicia Keys\n Written by£ºKeys/Illangelo/Tayla Parks/Billy Walsh\n Said I'd be gone by five\n And the sun rise and I'm still in your bad\n Goodnight usually means goodbye\n You're playing memories in my head\n Look at you look at you\n Look at you make me do\n Have you have you faked every move\n Who are you who are you\n You look so familiar\n I know you I know you\n Baby I know the truth\n We get way too much in common\n If I'm being honest with you\n We get way too much in common\n Since I'm being honest with you\n Who wants to love somebody like me\n You wanna know somebody like me\n If you could love somebody like me you must be miss out to\n Who wants to love somebody like me\n You wanna know somebody like me\n If you could love somebody like me you must be miss out to\n We used to talk till midnight\n All those days that you stayed at my house\n We were just passing the time\n And we were young and we ain't had no vows\n Now now now maybe later on\n I'll text you and maybe you'll reply\n We both know we had no patience to get the day and night\n Getting high on our supply yeah\n We ain't satisfied\n I could love you all occasions\n We got way too much in common\n If I'm being honest with you\n We got way too much in common\n Since I'm being honest with you\n Who wants to love somebody like me\n You wanna love somebody like me\n If you could love somebody like me\n You must be messed up too\n Who wants to love somebody like me\n You wanna love somebody like me\n If you could love somebody like me\n You must be messed up too\n Messed up too messed up too\n Just like you just like you\n Messed up too messed up too\n Just like you just like you\n We got way too much in common\n If I'm being honest with you\n We got way too much in common\n Since I'm being honest with you\n Who wants to love somebody like me\n You wanna love somebody like me\n If you could love somebody like me\n You must be messed up too\n Who wants to love somebody like me\n You wanna love somebody like me\n If you could love somebody like me\n You must be messed up too
