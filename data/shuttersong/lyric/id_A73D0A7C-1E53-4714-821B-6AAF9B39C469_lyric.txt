Be still my soul
Be still my soul
Soul
Be still my soul

Itâ€™s nice when the heart
The heart is beating faster
Feeling alive
When there is wanting
Be still my soul

Always the same
I jump too quickly
Be still my soul

Is love so serious?
The more we think, the less we know
Is love mysterious?
Holding tight when we should let go

Love so serious
The more we think, the less we know
Is love mysterious?
Holding tight when we should let go

[?]

Now that this love
Has overcome me
Now that this fire
Is burning bright

All of these words
Seem just beyond my reasoning
Be still my soul

Is love so serious?
The more we think, the less we know
Is love mysterious?
Holding tight when we should let go

Love so serious
The more we think, the less we know
Is love mysterious?
Holding tight when we should let go

Love so serious
The more we think, the less we know
Is love mysterious?
Holding tight when we should let go

Love so serious
The more we think, the less we know
Is love mysterious?
Holding tight when we should let go

Just let it go
Be still my soul
Just let it go
Be still my soul

Just let it go
Be still my soul
Just let it go
Be still my soul
