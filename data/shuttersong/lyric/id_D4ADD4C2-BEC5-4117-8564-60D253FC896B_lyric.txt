Ooh oh ... Yeah
You can be the peanut butter to my jelly
You can be the butterflies I feel in my belly
You can be the captain and I can be your first mate

You can be the chills that I feel on our first date
You can be the hero and I can be your side kick
You can be the tear that I cry if we ever split
You can be the rain from the cloud when it's storming

Or you can be the sun when it shines in the morning
Don't know if I could ever be
Without you 'cause boy you complete me
And in time I know that we'll both see

That we're all we need
'Cause you're the apple to my pie (pie)
You're the straw to my berry (berry)
You're the smoke to my high (high)

And you're the one I wanna marry (marry)
'Cause you're the one for me (for me)
And I'm the one for you (for you)
You take the both of us (of us)

And we're the perfect two
We're the perfect two
We're the perfect two
Baby me and you

We're the perfect two
You can be the prince and I can be your princess
You can be the sweet tooth I can be the dentist
You can be the shoes and I can be the laces

You can be the heart that I spill on the pages
You can be the vodka and I can be the chaser
You can be the pencil and I can be the paper
You can be as cold as the winter weather

But I don't care as long as we're together
Don't know if I could ever be
Without you 'cause boy you complete me
And in time I know that we'll both see

That we're all we need
'Cause you're the apple to my pie
You're the straw to my berry
You're the smoke to my high

And you're the one I wanna marry
'Cause you're the one for me (for me)
And I'm the one for you (for you)
You take the both of us (of us)

And we're the perfect two
We're the perfect two
We're the perfect two
Baby me and you

We're the perfect two
You know that I'll never doubt ya
And you know that I think about ya

And you know I can't live without ya
I love the way that you smile
And maybe in just a while
I can see me walk down the aisle
'Cause you're the apple to my pie
You're the straw to my berry
You're the smoke to my high
And you're the one I wanna marry
'Cause you're the one for me (for me)
And I'm the one for you (for you)
You take the both of us (of us)
And we're the perfect two
We're the perfect two
We're the perfect two
Baby me and you
We're the perfect two

You can be the peanut butter to my jelly
Kau bisa jadi mentega kacang bagi jeliku
You can be the butterflies I feel in my belly
Kau bisa jadi kupu-kupu yang kurasakan di perutku
You can be the captain and I can be your first mate
Kau bisa jadi kapten dan aku bisa jadi teman utamamu
You can be the chills that I feel on our first date
Kau bisa jadi gemetar yang kurasakan di kencan pertama kita

You can be the hero and I can be your side kick
Kau bisa jadi pahlawan dan aku bisa jadi tentang sampingmu
You can be the tear that I cry if we ever split
Kau bisa jadi air mata yang kutumpahkan jika kita berpisah
You can be the rain from the cloud when it's stormin'
Kau bisa jadi hujan dari awan saat badai datang
Or you can be the sun when it shines in the mornin'
Atau kau bisa jadi mentari saat ia bersinar di pagi hari

PRE-CHORUS
Don't know if I could ever be
Tak tahu apakah aku kan bisa
Without you cause boy you complete me
Tanpamu karena, kasih, kau melengkapimu
And in time I know that we'll both see
Dan dari dulu aku tahu bahwa kita berdua kan tahu
That we're all we need
Bahwa yang kita butuhkan adalah kita
Cause you're the apple to my pie
Karena kau adalah apel bagi pie ku
You're the straw to my berry
Kau straw bagi beri-ku
You're the smoke to my high
Kau asap bagi mabukku
And you're the one I wanna marry
Dan kau orang yang ingin kunikahi

Cause you're the one for me for me (for me)
Karena kau untukku
And I'm the one for you for you (for you)
Dan aku untukmu
You take the both of us of us (of us)
Kau jumlahkan kita berdua
And we're the perfect two
Dan kita adalah pasangan sempurna
We're the perfect two
Kita adalah pasangan sempurna
We're the perfect two
Kita adalah pasangan sempurna
Baby me and you
Kasih, aku dan kau
We're the perfect two
Kita adalah pasangan sempurna

You can be the prince and I can be your princess
Kau bisa jadi pangeran dan aku bisa jadi putrimu
You can be the sweet tooth I can be the dentist
Kau bisa jadi gigi manis dan aku bisa jadi dokter gigi
You can be the shoes and I can be the laces
Kau bisa jadi sepatu dan aku bisa jadi talinya
You can be the heart that I spill on the pages
Kau bisa jadi hati yang kutumpahkan di halaman buku

You can be the vodka and I can be the chaser
Kasu bisa jadi vodka dan aku bisa jadi chasernya
You can be the pencil and I can be the paper
Kau bisa jadi pensil dan aku bisa jadi kertasnya
You can be as cold as the winter weather
Kau bisa jadi sedingin musim dingin
But I don't care as long as we're together
Tapi aku tak peduli selama kita bersama

PRE-CHORUS

You know that I'll never doubt ya
Kau tahu aku takkan pernah meragukanmu
And you know that I think about ya
Dan kau tahu bahwa aku memikirkanmu
And you know I can't live without ya
Dan kau tahu aku tak bisa hidup tanpamu

I love the way that you smile
Aku suka senyummu
And maybe in just a while
Dan mungkin sekejap
I can see me walk down the aisle
Bisa kulihat diriku susuri lorong gereja

Cause you're the apple to my pie
Karena kau adalah apel bagi pie ku
You're the straw to my berry
Kau straw bagi beri-ku
You're the smoke to my high
Kau asap bagi mabukku
And you're the one I wanna marry
Dan kau orang yang ingin kunikahi
