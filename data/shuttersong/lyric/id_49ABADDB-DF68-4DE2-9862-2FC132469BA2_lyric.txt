I don't wanna be the last man standing
I don't wanna be the lonely one
Picking petals when the party's over
No, it's not any fun

Cause I'm fragile
And you know this

So hold me
Wrap me in love, fill up my cup
Empty and only your love can fill up my cup
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh

I don't wanna be the first one folding
I don't wanna be the joker heart
Tell me, darling, will you understand me?
And not show me your cards?

Cause I'm paper-thin
And you, you make me whole again

So hold me
Wrap me in love, fill up my cup
Empty and only your love can fill up my cup
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh

Look, I know you've been up at night
Tryna sleep with one eye open
Cryin' out enough tears, you could fill up the Atlantic Ocean

No fun bein' home alone, we learn this from Macaulay Culkin
So I'm just waitin' on you
I've been callin', pick me up
I know you need to pick me up
I need you to come grip me up, you my baby girl no sippy cup
Cup half empty or half full, I mean neither way just come and fill me up
Let's take it back to the old days, head downtown and light the city up
On the late-late-late night, just pick a date then it's date night
Karaoke, no stage fright
Girl, you was made for the stage light
Cause you got that phenomenal, most honorable
Got me fallin', domino
Take you home to mama though, you know
And hold me
Wrap me in love, fill up my cup
Empty, cause only your love can fill up my cup
So hold me
Wrap me in love, fill up my cup
Empty and only your love can fill up my cup
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh
Cause I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh
Cause I'm hollow (yeah)
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh (oh yeah)
Cause I'm hollow (I'm hollow)
Yeah, I'm hollow, oh oh oh
