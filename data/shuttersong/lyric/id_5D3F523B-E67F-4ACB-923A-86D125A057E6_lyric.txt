Homegrown Honey - Darius Rucker\n Sitting at a bar in New York City\n Everybody here looking New York pretty\n But you're that kinda girl that's got that something\n Dancing to the groove like it just ain't nothing\n They ain't never seen nothing quite like you\n Long stem legs in your cowboy boots\n Throwing back whiskey straight  no water\n Girl there ain't nothing harder\n Uh  I dig the way that you move\n You shake it down in your roots\n How did your momma teach you how to do that\n Thing you do\n Yeah  nothing sweeter than wild\n I'll take a sip of that smile\n I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone\n You little homegrown honey  honey  honey\n You're so money  money  money\n You got a country road Carolina soul\n Baby you're just so homegrown\n Trying to think of something cool to say\n Turned around and saw you walking my way\n Pulled me on the floor saying: ¡°Son it's on ¡±\n And we were dancing all night long\n To a sweet old Alabama song\n Uh  I dig the way that you move\n You shake it down in your roots\n How did your momma teach you how to do that\n Thing you do\n Yeah  nothing sweeter than wild\n I'll take a sip of that smile\n I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone\n You little homegrown honey  honey  honey\n You're so money  money  money\n You got a country road Carolina soul\n Baby you're just so homegrown\n Ooh baby  baby  baby\n You driving me crazy  crazy  crazy\n I'm a long way away from where I'm from\n But baby you feel like home\n Uuh  I dig the way that you move\n You shake it down in your roots\n How did your momma teach you how to do that\n Thing you do\n Yeah  nothing sweeter than wild\n I'll take a sip of that smile\n I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone\n You little homegrown honey  honey  honey\n You're so money  money  money\n You got a country road Carolina soul\n Baby you're just so homegrown\n Honey  honey  honey\n You're so money  money  money\n You got a country road Carolina soul\n Baby you're just so homegrown
