I got a death wish, her looks can kill
She's got a red dress, lipstick and heels

Pull me in, get me hooked like a junky
Got me feelin' so high

You're such a beautiful drug, I can't get enough
Addicted and I'm dyin' for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me

She lets her hair down, and all of mine stand up
Can't help but stare now, gotta feel that touch
Her kiss, my fix so sweet
Can't quit those lips are a habit to me
Sweet intoxication and I'm never gettin' sober
I can tell that the effects are takin' over

Pull me in get me hooked like a junky
Got me feelin' so high

You're such a beautiful drug, I can't get enough
Addicted and I'm dyin' for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me
Tonight

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

Such a beautiful drug, I can't get enough
I'm addicted and dyin' for a hit of your love
I'm losin' it baby
Keep drivin' me crazy, crazy
Goin' out of my mind, starin' at you
Burnin' up in your fire that I've fallen into
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me
Tonight
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
