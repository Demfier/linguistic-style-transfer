They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to

They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do

& be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road & one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road & one on

They got one eye watching you
& on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true

Bu-but don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
& we just gotta turn up to be heard

I hear the crocodiles ticking around the world
I hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking around the world

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road & one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh
Got one eye on the road & one on
I can hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side by you
& my left heart's under the chest
Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh
Got one eye on the road & one on you
Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh
Got one eye on the road & one on you
