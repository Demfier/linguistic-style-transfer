When nothin in life's going right
And everything you do goes wrong
The work you puttin in is not enough
Is it up to me to even give a fuck

I wanna tell you what's inside
I've been thinking about it for so long
Sure I wanted love its fine
I guess I didn't just belong

Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love

Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love

My mind's got me crazy
My views just be so hazy
I'll be giving thots the time of day cause I be lazy
Words I should be saying
But you ain't worth the saving
I don't need you anymore cause I can't call you baby

This ain't the same love I've been feeling
Cause I've always thought about just leaving
When I heard you were deceiving
I guess I had no meaning

Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love

Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Said I just need my Liquid Love
Liquid Love
Liquid Love
