I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fireflies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home
I've got aching feet
From walking over miles of concrete
And I can't wait to dream
But the city, you know she won't go to sleep
So I'm saying
Goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fireflies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home
Yeah, we got brighter lights
Back home there's a girl named Mary Lou
A diner off the highway with a corner booth
And every gravel road is a trip down memory lane
And back home, where the corn grows ten feet tall
Every year's measured on the pantry wall
The willow trees are waving 'til we come back home again
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
