Thick-skinned chameleon
Climbs the curtains hanging on the wall
The only living ghost to grace the hall

Meanwhile on the battlefield
Another soldier boldly bites his tongue

The only noble thing he's ever done

Step one: wake up
Now open your eyes
Now float to the window
Open the blinds
Now nevermind
The cold shiver on your over-exposed spine

Still lying on the bed where you left it,
Soaking up the sleep from the mattress

And that's it
Feel your way to the kitchen
Bring the milk to a simmer
Spill the sugar on the surface of the counter
Thin-skinned calcium sipper

Thick-skinned chameleon
Open your eyes now...
Hanging on...
The only living ghost to grace the hall
Meanwhile on the battlefield
Another soldier...
Still lying on the bed
Soaking up the sleep from...
The only noble ghost to grace the hall
And that's it
Feel your way to the kitchen
Bring the milk to a simmer
Spill the sugar on the surface of the counter
Thin-skinned calcium sipper
