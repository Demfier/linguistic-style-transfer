Let me take you, baby, down to the river bed
Got to tell you somethin', go right to your head
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe

Gotta put your arms around me with every bit of your love
If you know what to do, I'll make love to you
We got the right line to make it through these times

I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe

I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe

Now listen, our winter's almost over
This summer, she's comin' on strong
I can love you, love you, love you
Love you all year long

I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe

I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
I, I got a line, I got a line on you, babe
