Nothing more than strangers passing by out on the street
Memories are fading though it's only been a week
All the little things are gone, the things we used to be
Nobody could take us down, there was only you and me
And without you I can't be
You're the universe
to me
You're the air in my lungs

You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating
It's you, you, you
It's you, woah
And without you I can't be

You're the universe
to me

You're the air in my lungs
You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating
It's you, you, you
It's you, woah

Don't want to be a stranger, want to be the one you need
I can be your world, your life, your lover, all for free

All the little things come back, the things we used to be
Nobody can take us down there, it's only you and me
And without you I can't be
You're the universe
to me
You're the air in my lungs
You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating
