Bite your tongue
Don't make a scene dear
Everybody's been here
At least once before

We've been here more
Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
I've seen it all go and comeback around

And I've heard the sound
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs
Is doing my head in
I say love I don't need nothing

Unless there's something worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
When I hold the warmth of your body
There is nobody that I'd rather hold

Shattered and cold
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is making me crazy
I say love I don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for

It's a beautiful war
I say love you don't need nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for

It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war

It's a beautiful war
I say love I say love
Don't mean nothing

Unless there's something worth fighting for
I say love
Don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
