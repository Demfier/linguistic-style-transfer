Written by£ºCARLY RAE JEPSEN/JACOB KASHER HINDLIN/JEFF HALAVACS/PETER ANDERS SVENSSON
I really wanna stop
But I just gotta taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the ball on the moon
So honey hold my hand you like making me wait for it
I feel I could die walking up to the room oh yeah
Late night watching television
But how we get in this position
It's way too soon I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
Oh did I say too much
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
Do you want me too
Do you want me too
Do you want me too
Do you want me too
Want me too
Want me too
Want me too
Want me too
Want me too
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone you and me and this temptation
Sipping on your lips hanging on by thread baby
Late night watching television
But how we get in this position
It's way too soon I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
Oh did I say too much
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
Yeah
And I want you do you want me do you want me too
