Do you know what it feels like to dance alone?
Do you know what it feels like?
Do you know what it looks like from the outside?
Do you know what it looks like?
Won't you get up, shaking the darkness?
Won't you get up?
And we could just start this now
Cause when you get up I couldn't deny that
You're the one I want at my side tonight
Turn up the lights

I just wanna see you dancing
I just wanna see you
Turn up the lights
I just wanna see you dancing
I just wanna see you dancing

Do you know what it feels like to be the one
Out here on the dance floor just watching up?
Do you know what it hurts like to be left alone?
Do you know what it hurts like?

Cause when you get up I couldn't deny that
You're the one I want at my side tonight
Turn up the lights

I just wanna see you dancing
I just wanna see you
Turn up the lights

I just wanna see you dancing
I just wanna see you dancing
When the lights are turn too low for me

In the dark I feel you close to me
You're the one that I want to see
You're the one that I want to see
When the lights are turn too low for me
In the dark I feel you close to me
You're the one that I want to see
You're the one that I want to see
When the lights are turn too low for me

In the dark I feel you close to me
You're the one that I want to see
You're the one for me
Turn up the lights

I just wanna see you dancing
I just wanna see you
Turn up the lights
I just wanna see you dancing
I just wanna see you dancing (I wanna see you)
I just wanna see you dancing
I just wanna see you (I wanna see you dancing)
I wanna see you
I wanna see you
I wanna see you
I wanna see you
