First time I met you
I knew you would be trouble
You turn my world to rubble baby
While you were sleeping
I swear I heard you mumble
Say how'd you get her number baby

You pulled the trigger
You dug the grave

All bets off
Once the gun goes off
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet
Washed my hands
Of your bloodstained love
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet

[x2:]
(Oeh oeh oeh)
Boom hey! Take back the bullet

If you wanted out
You know you could've called me
I really would've listened baby
But now that it's over
You know I'm feeling better
You're looking so pathetic baby

You pulled the trigger
This can't be saved

All bets off
Once the gun goes off
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet
Washed my hands
Of your bloodstained love
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet

[x4:]
(Oeh oeh oeh)
Boom hey! Take back the bullet

Love me when you sweet talk
Love her when you sleep walk

All bets off
Once the gun goes off
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet
Washed my hands
Of your bloodstained love
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet

All bets off
Once the gun goes off
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet
Washed my hands
Of your bloodstained love
Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet

[x3:]
(Oeh oeh oeh)
Boom hey! Take back the bullet

Cause you can't take back
Take back the bullet
