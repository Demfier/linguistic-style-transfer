As a child you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew
That you'll be the one
That work while they all play
In youth you lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things
That you would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are
Don't turn away now
We are the warriors
That built this town
Here we are
Don't turn away now
We are the warriors
That built this town
The time
Will come
When you'll have to rise
Above the best
Improve yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell I've gone
To take my throne
Above don't weep for me
'Cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are
Don't turn away now
We are the warriors
That built this town
Here we are
Don't turn away now
We are the warriors
That built this town
From dust
Here we are
Don't turn away now
We are the warriors
That built this town
Here we are
Don't turn away now
We are the warriors
That built this town
From dust
