Just because oh I’m not heavy doesn’t mean he doesn’t love me oh you’re gonna love me ‘cause I’m sane.
Oh you’re making me rock back and forth inside my lonely boat.
Everyone will try to stop what they know they cannot control.

And it’s a ride on the other side and it’s a one way ticket to my other mind.
You’re so attractive attractive attractive when you fall.
And it’s your heart beating inside and it’s a one way ticket to my other mind.
I’m so attractive attractive attractive when I fall.
And I’m just reading.

Just because oh I’m not heavy doesn’t mean he doesn’t love me oh you’re gonna love me ‘cause I’m sane.
Oh reasons not to leave multiply like rabbits with hard drinks.
Everyone will try to stomp as I drift on back into my sheets.

And it’s a ride on the other side and it’s a one way ticket to my other mind.
You’re so attractive attractive attractive when you fall.
And it’s your heart beating inside and it’s a one way ticket to my other mind.
I’m so attractive attractive attractive when I fall.
And I’m just reading.

Just because oh I’m not heavy doesn’t mean he doesn’t love me oh you’re gonna love me ‘cause I’m oh, you’re gonna love me ‘cause I’m oh, you’re gonna love me ‘cause I’m sane.
