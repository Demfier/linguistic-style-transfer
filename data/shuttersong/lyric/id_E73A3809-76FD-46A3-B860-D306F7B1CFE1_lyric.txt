Red red wine Friday night
Never forget it  how you let me go
No more lies  I'll be fine
Know where I'm headed  probably shoulda known
And now you're gonna say
Pretty please forgive me
Fool me once  told you twice  gonna regret it
Now you're all alone  yeah
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent  you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste
Close your eyes  you can't hide
Try to forget me  but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets
You weren't ready when you left me there
And now you're gonna say
Pretty please forgive me
Yeah  bet it hurts it gets worse  you know nobody
Said it would be fair  oh
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent  you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste
And now there's something in your way
Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts cause
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent  you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
And the aftertaste
