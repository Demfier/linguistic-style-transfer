Putting my defences up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

Never put my love out to the world
Never say yes to the right girl
Never had trouble getting what I want
When it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play em all like a ken doll
Won't wash my hair
And make em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a guy
Who buy flowers and open doors
Yes you, make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defences up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

I never break a sweat for the other girls
I've always been a fool for them long curls
And everytime I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
Feels so good, but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a guy
Who buy flowers and open doors
Yes you, make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defences up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

The feelings I lose in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
And there's no one else to blame
So instead I'll take off and run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I'll burt into flames!

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defences up
Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack.
