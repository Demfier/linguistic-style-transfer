End Up Here - 5 Seconds Of Summer
You walked in
Everyone was asking for your name
You just smiled
And told them "trouble"
My head spins
I'm pressed against the wall
Just watching your every move
You're way too cool
And you're coming this way
Coming this way
How did we end up
Talking in the first place
You said you like my Cobain shirt
Now were walking back to your place
You're telling me
How you love that song
About living on a prayer
I'm pretty sure
That we're halfway there
And when I wake up next to you
I wonder how
How did we end up here 
How did we end up 
How did we end up here 
Next day out
Everybody thought
You were so insane
Cause you were so far
Out of my league
My friends say
I should lock you down
Before you figure me out
And you run away
But you don't
And you won't as you kiss me
And you tell me
That you're here to stay
How did we end up talking
In the first place
You said you like my Cobain shirt
Now were walking back to your place
You're telling me
How you love that song
About living on a prayer
I'm pretty sure
That we're halfway there
And when I wake up next to you
I wonder how
How did we end up here 
Call me lucky 'cause in the end
I'm a 6 and she's a 10
She's so fit
I'm insecure
But she keeps coming back for more
(more)
How did we end up
Talking in the first place
You said you like my Cobain shirt
Now were walking back to your place
You're telling me
How you love that song
About living on a prayer
I'm pretty sure
That we're halfway there
And when I wake up
Next to you I wonder how
How did we end up here 
How did we end up 
How did we end up here 
How did we end up 
How did we end up here
