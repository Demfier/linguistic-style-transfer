We've been waiting
Anticipating change coming our way

You're my baby
Trough the bad nights, trough the brighter days
I know that something good is waiting just around the corner

There's a new day dawning
There's a new life for us
Got to keep on holding on for just a little longer,
I know
That it's gonna be blue skies
For you and I

We'll step out of the shadows
and walk into the light

Yeah, it's gonna be blue skies
For you and I
But my heart beats slow as the storm carries on up high

And the clouds roll by
I can feel it
It's coming fast and fierce and wild
I can see it
Everytime I look into those eyes

Tell me is it really gonna storm again
Will the sky turn dark, will the rain begin?
I wanna be with you wherever
lightning strikes, cause I know

That it's gonna be blue skies
For you and I
We'll step out of the shadows
and walk into the light
Yeah, it's gonna be blue skies
For you and I

But my heart beats slow as the storm carries on up high
And the clouds roll by
And the clouds roll by
I can't stand rain for one more day
I know we can make it go away
Can you fell it?
Like a fever, burning till it breaks
Blue skies
For you and I
We'll step out of the shadows
and walk into the light
Yeah, it's gonna be blue skies
For you and I
But my heart beats slow as the storm comes or up righ
And the clouds roll by
Blue skies, Blue skies
(And the clouds roll by)
Blue skies, Blue skies
(And the clouds roll)
Blue skies, Blue skies
(And the clouds roll by)
Blue skies, Blue skies
(And the clouds roll by)
