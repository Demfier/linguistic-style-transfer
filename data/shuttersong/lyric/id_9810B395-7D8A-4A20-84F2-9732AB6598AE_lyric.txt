When the snow begins to fly
above the smoky smoky sky
you came along like a snowflake
and brightened up my day
There is just one thing I need
on this snowy winter day
Call me a fool to love you but
I want nothing but you

Oh I have to hear your voice
the one that brings me joy
And your warmth slowly wraps around my heart
boy can't you see?

The lights are shining on me
and it's like a diamond
I'm spinning around rocking around
like a diamond
That's because I'm filled with emotions

Everybody's waiting for the holidays
Candies and toys of silver trays
And there is one thing special
Boy you are my present
There is just one thing I need
on this snowy winter day
Call me a fool to love you but
I want nothing but you

Oh I have to hear your voice the one
that brings me joy
And your warmth slowly wraps around my heart
boy can't you see?

¡ª SMTOWN
The lights are shining on me
and it's like a diamond
I'm spinning around rocking around
like a diamond
That's because I'm filled with emotions
That's because I'm filled with emotions

You're shining
you're gleaming
Oh you melt me like white snow oh
You're shining
You're gleaming
And your warmth slowly wraps around my heart
Boy can't you see

The lights are shining on me
and it's like a diamond
I'm spinning around rocking around
like diamonds
To your heart
The lights are shining on me
and it's like a diamond
I'm spinning around rocking around
like a diamond
That's because I'm filled with emotions
