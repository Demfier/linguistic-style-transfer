Show Me Love - Robin Schulz J U D G E 
There's a notebook on the table
You can take it to the store so you won't forget the groceries anymore
There's a rifle in the cabinet that I used to fight a war
But to this day I don't know what I was fighting for
I'm fighting for
Will you show me love as we get older
And I'm falling at your feet
After thirty years of service
And one to fit our need
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
But our hearts will never meet
There's a blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four
There's a record we keep turning that reminds us of our youth
But There's still nothing as beautiful as you
Will you show me love as we get older
And I'm falling at your feet
After thirty years of service
And one to fit our need
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
But our hearts will never meet
As we grow colder
Love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
Hearts will never meet
Because your hand belongs in my hand belongs in your hand
Belongs with you
Blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
There's a record we keep turning that I used to turn you on
Will you show me love as we get older
And I'm falling at your feet
After thirty years of service
And one to fit our need
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
But our hearts will never meet
