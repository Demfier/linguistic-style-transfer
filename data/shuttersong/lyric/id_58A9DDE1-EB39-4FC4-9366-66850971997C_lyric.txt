Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? could this be happening to me

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you, walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say, to you
Now what i'm supposed to do

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But i'm catching feelings, catching feelings (girl)

In my head we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you i'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and i'll be right there (be right there)
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just trying to see where this can take us
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get at the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But i'm catching feelings, catching feelings (girl)

Should I tell her how I really feel (how I really feel?)
Or should I move in closer or just be still (how will I know?)
Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, woah
Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to see what's up

It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But i'm catching feelings, catching feelings (girl)
Catching feelings, catching feelings...
