she said dear Matthew
i spent most of my life
in a downwards spiral
its true
always feeling like there was just no way out
no matter what i was trying to do

when i finally hit rock bottom
when i heard them lock me up
behind those bars
and it kills me to say i gave birth to my daughter there and in that moment it recked my heart

but i found that you can find hope
in the hopeless places
when you are hanging
at the end of your rope
man thats where grace is

anything anything anything is
anything is possible
i believe that the one i believe in
he is the god of the impossible
because love can fix
a busted heart like mine
put it back together
every single time
turn my mess to a miracle
anything is possible

she said fast forward six years later
and then sometimes
i still cant believe my eyes
i went back to school
got a job and a new house
god has blessed me with a beautiful life
and i look at that little girl
every morning when i wake up
and those eyes are so blue
that they are the proof that
no matter what never give up

anything anything anything is
anything is possible
i believe that the one i believe in
he is the god of the impossible
because love can fix
a busted heart like mine
put it back together
every single time
turn my mess to a miracle
anything is possible

just when you thought it never could
love is working all things for the good
...
so lift your eyes up
to the one who makes a way

...
where there was no way
she said matthew thats my story
and I'm sticking too it

it ain't perfect but it must be told because there is somebody out there with the odds stacked against them
...
so write my song and let them know
anything anything anything is
anything is possible
i believe that the one i believe in
he is the god of the impossible
because love can fix
a busted heart like mine
put it back together

every single time
turn my mess to a miracle
anything is possible
anything is possible
anything anything anything is
anything is possible
anything anything anything is
love fixed a busted heart like mine
anything anything anything is
anything is possible
anything anything anything is
