Oh, there she goes again
Every morning is the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
From where I'm standing
You got me thinking
What we could because
I keep craving, craving
You don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words
They wanna say to you
This is typical of love
Can't wait anymore
Won't wait I need to tell you
How I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams
You're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night
That we kiss
For the first time
Or is that just me
And my imagination?
We walk
We left we spend our time
Walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined
A feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone
Thinking we could not be lone
To something so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful
I keep craving, craving you
Don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words
They wanna say to you
This is typical of love
Can't wait anymore
Won't wait I need to tell you how I feel
When I see us together forever
In my dreams
You're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night
That we kiss
For the first time
Or is that just me
And my imagination?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Imagination
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Imagination
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In my dreams
You're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night
That we kiss
For the first time
Or is that just me
And my imagination?
I keep craving, craving
You don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words
They wanna say to you
