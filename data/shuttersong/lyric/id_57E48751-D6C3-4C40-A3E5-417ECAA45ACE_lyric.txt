I figured it out	
I figured it out from black and white	
Seconds and hours	
Maybe they had to take some time I know how it goes	
I know how it goes from wrong and right	
Silence and sound	
Did they ever hold each other tight,like us	
Did they ever fight like us	
You and I	
We don't wanna be like them	
We can make it rill the end	
Nothing can come between you and I	
Not even the Gods above can separete the two of us	
No nothing can came between you and I	
Oh, you and I	
i figured it out	
Saw the mistakes of up and down	
meet in the middle	
There's always room for common ground	
i see what it's like	
I see what it's like for day and night	
Never together	
Cause they see yout things in a different light like ys	
Did they ever try like us?	
You and I	
We don't wanna be like them	
We can make it till the end	
Nothing can come between you and I	
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us	
You and I	
We donn't wanna ne like them	
We can make it till the end	
No nothing can come between you and I	
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us	
no nothing can come between you and I	
Oh-you and I
