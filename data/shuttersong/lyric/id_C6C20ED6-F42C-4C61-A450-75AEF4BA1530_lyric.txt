 something strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like boy need girl and girl need boy
Got a nasty habit called rock'n'roll
But you don't know what it's like
I've done things you've only dreamed about
More than once or twice
Tt keeps me up at night
Jump up' bubble up' what's in store?
Bryan looked for love' but I want more
I found another beat' there's no time for sleep
 Something sweet and  something  strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like the girls in suits and those pretty boys
I gave my heart to rock'n'roll
To rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll
Oh' oh..
So you can call the police
I'm sorry 'bout my manners' but you see'
I'm a bit drunk as you can see
I bet you would like to undress me
 Something sweet and  something  strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like boy need girl and girl need boy
Got a nasty habit called rock'n'roll
 Something sweet and  something  strong
Seems like love no longer can turn me on
Like the girls in suits and those pretty boys
I gave my heart to rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll
Oh' oh...
