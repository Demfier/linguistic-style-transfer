Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing
That makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories
For ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby there'll be worse things
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take
With us when we die
You can fix me
Inside the necklace you bought
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
