Yeah-eh-heah
you are, my fire
the one, desire
believe, when i say

i want it that way
But we, are two worlds apart
can't reach to your heart
when you say

that i want it that way
Tell me why
ain't nothin' but a heartache
tell me why
ain't nothin' but a mistake
tell me why
i never wanna hear you say

i want it that way
Am i, your fire?
your one, desire
yes i know, it's too late

but i want it that way
Tell me why
ain't nothin' but a heartache
tell me why
ain't nothin' but a mistake
tell me why
i never wanna hear you say

i want it that way
Now i can see that we've fallen apart
from the way that it used to be, yeah
no matter the distance

i want you to know
that deep down inside of me...
You are, my fire

the one, desire

you are (you are, you are, you are...)

Don't wanna hear you say
ain't nothin' but a heartache
ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
i never wanna hear you say
i want it that way

Tell me why
ain't nothin' but a heartache
tell me why
ain't nothin' but a mistake
tell me why
i never wanna hear you say (don't wanna hear you say)
i want it that way
Tell me why... ain't nothin' but a heartache
ain't nothin' but a mistake
tell me why
i never wanna hear you say (never wanna hear you say it)
i want it that way
Cuz i want it that way
