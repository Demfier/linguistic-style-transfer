You're an angel in disguise
When you cover your eyes
But angels don't need covering

You're a princess, you're a queen
You don't need finer things
But I'll buy you diamond rings just because

'Cause you break the rules of beautiful
So stay with me for a minute more
No need to fix what's beautiful, you're beautiful
Like a flower all alone in a field of weeds
You don't need to change you just need to be
The way you were made is just for me, you're beautiful
'Cause you break the rules of beautiful

The rules cause they are over look your heart
We got history that deeper than these scars
Oh and I'll take it all, all of your secrets and flaws
You make history by being who you are

'Cause you break the rules of beautiful
So stay with me for a minute more
No need to fix what's beautiful, you're beautiful
Like a flower all alone in a field of weeds
You don't need to change you just need to be
The way you were made is just for me, you're beautiful
You break the rules of beautiful

Oh you're beautiful
Oh you're beautiful
Oh you're beautiful

'Cause you break the rules of beautiful
So stay with me for a minute more
No need to fix what's beautiful, you're beautiful
Like a flower all alone in a field of weeds
You don't need to change you just need to be
The way you were made is just for me, you're beautiful
You break the rules of beautiful

If I re-wrote the rules for beautiful
I would trace you on a page and put it up
So the whole wide world can finally see whats beautiful
You break the rules of beautiful
