Carry on
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
the cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
and I found you with a bottle of wine

your head in the curtains
and heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not

We are not shining stars
This I know

I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
to know you can never look back
If you're lost and alone

Or you're sinking like a stone

Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on
So I met up with some friends
at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
about how our parents will die
All our neighbours and wives

But I like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know

When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground

Carry on
Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
Cause after all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door

Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now
Cause we are
We are shining stars

We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on
