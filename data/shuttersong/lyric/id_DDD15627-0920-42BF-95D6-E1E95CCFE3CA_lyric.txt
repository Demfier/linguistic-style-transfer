Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch (I don't wanna be needing your love)
Never knew that it could mean so much (I just wanna be deep in your love)

So much
You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites ('Cause I really don't care where you are)
You can see the world you brought to life (I just wanna be there where you are)
To life
Your sugar (Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do)
Yes, please (Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do)
Won't you come and put it down on me

I'm right here, 'cause I need (Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do)
Little love and little sympathy
I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving, I need it now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees (I'll let you set the pace)
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you my friend (Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do)
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do)
We've come a long way from where we began (Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do)
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
Oooh-ooooh-oh
So let the light guide your way
Yeh, hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home, home, home

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Your sugar, Yes, please)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (It's been a long day without you my friend)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do (You show me good loving Make it all right)
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again, when I see you again
