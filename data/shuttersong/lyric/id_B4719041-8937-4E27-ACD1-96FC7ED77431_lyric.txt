"We Are Young"

Windows down
Pedal to the sneakers
Turn up the volume
Blow out the speakers
Best clothes on
Going down on fire
Turn the lights off
Turn the music higher
I broke free, cast away
Won't find me
And now you're never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take, so farewell cause you're never gonna find me now, gonna find me now

We are young! (Woah!)
We are young! (Woah!)
We drink and we fight and we love just because we are numb,
We're on the run and you're never gonna chase us down.
We are young.

Dance with the devil
Don't be shy
Nothings gonna stop us
We can't die
Sleepin in a bed
Waking up outside
At least I can say I tried
So you fathers don't let go of your daughters
We take what we want we don't borrow
Think I found a message in a bottle
This says "Drink me, drown your sorrows."

I broke free, cast away
Won't find me
And now your never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take, so farewell cause you're never gonna find me now, gonna find me now

We are young! we are young!
We drink and we fight and we love just because, we are numb,
We're on the run and you're never gonna chase us down.
We are young. (young young young)
We are young (young young young)
We are young (young young young)
And you're never gonna chase us down
We are young

If I'm doin this right
I'll be leavin tonight
I got my bags packed tight
So many reasons to leave
I got my hands on my keys
Ya I'll be leavin tonight

We are young! we are young!
We drink and we fight and we love just because, we are numb,
We're on the run and you're never gonna chase us down.
We are young. (young young young)
We are young (young young young)
We are young (young young young)
And you're never gonna chase us down
We are young
