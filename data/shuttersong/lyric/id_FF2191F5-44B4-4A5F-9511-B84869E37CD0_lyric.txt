Rockin' around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop


Rockin' around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
and we'll do some caroling


You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly
(Deck the halls with boughs of holly")


Rockin' around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way


You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly;
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"
