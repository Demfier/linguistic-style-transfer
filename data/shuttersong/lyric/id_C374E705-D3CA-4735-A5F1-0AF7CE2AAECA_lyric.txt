You're setting off, it's time to go, the engine's running
My mind is lost, we always knew this day was coming
And now its more frightening than it's ever gonna be
We grow apart, I watch you on the red horizon
Your lion's heart will protect you under stormy skies
And I will always be listening for your laughter and your tears
And as soon as I can hold you once again
I won't let go of you, I swear

We live through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
We can't leave us behind
Anymore

Your hands are cold, your lips are turning blue, you're shaking
This fragile heart, so heavy in my chest, it's breaking
And in the dark, you try to make a pay phone call to me

But you're miles away, you're breaking up
You're on your own
It's hard to take, I need an hour just to say hello
And I can't make the truth of this work out for you or me
And for all the pennies on your pocket
We barely get a second just to speak

We live through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
We can't leave us behind
Anymore

We'll have to hurt for now
But next time there's no doubt
'Cause I can't go without you
Anymore

Oh no oh oh
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

Oh oh
Yeah, yeah
We live through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
No, we can't leave us behind
Anymore
We'll have to hurt for now
But next time there's no doubt
'Cause I can't go without you
Anymore
No, I can't go without you
Anymore
