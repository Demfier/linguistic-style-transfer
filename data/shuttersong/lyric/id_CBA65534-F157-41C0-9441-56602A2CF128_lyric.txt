Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
That's when you start to make it better
Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain
Hey Jude refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
Don't you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world just a little bit colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now get out and get her
Ah the minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin ah to make it better

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude don'tcha know that you'll do
The answer is there
Right upon on your shoulder

Hey hey hey Jude don'tcha let me down
Take a sad song and make it better
Ah the minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin ah to make it
Ah better better better
