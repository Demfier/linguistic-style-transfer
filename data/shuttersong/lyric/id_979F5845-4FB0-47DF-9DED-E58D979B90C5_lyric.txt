I won't be long
It's just for now
Oh, I'll come back here
When time allows

Save my name in your phone
I'll be fine, but I don't know
When I'll be back again, I'll be back again
Keep my love close to yours
We'll lay down again, once more
When I'll get back again
I get back again

And it's hard to live without
Your softest touch
Your burning mouth
Your burning mouth

I don't want to be long
and it's so hard for you to ride along
So wait for me, and I'll be back again
Let me know if you feel a little lost
A little too real
and I'll come back again, I'll come back again

And I guess, I guess I never really thought it through enough
And I guess, I guess I never really thought it through enough
And I guess, I guess I never really thought it through enough
Thought it through enough
Thought it through
It hurts alone
but don't you worry
I'm coming home
I'm coming home.
