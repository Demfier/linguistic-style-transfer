I will stand by you even when we fall
I will be the rock that holds you up
And lifts you high so you stand tall

I won't let you go
No one can take your place
Oh a couple fights and lonely nights
Don't make it right to let it go to waste

And I won't let you fall I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be there
No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be there

I will hold on to everything we've got
A quitter and regretter and forgetter is everything I'm not
I'll take care of you, love you just because
You and I are better than forever
Nothing can stop us

And I won't let you fall I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be there
No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be there

We could be the generation who learns how to love
Mistakes and empty promises will never be enough
So tear apart these giant hearts that beat inside us now
Let's conquer the percentages, and rise above the crowd

And I won't let you fall I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be there
No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be there
No matter where you are
No matter where you are I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
