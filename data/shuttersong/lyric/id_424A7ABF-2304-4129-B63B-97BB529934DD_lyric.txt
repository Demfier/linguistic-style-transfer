Darling
I know your heart's seen better times
I know our songs had better rhymes
Before Today. No.
Darling, I guess I made the wrong mistakes
I understand if you need your space
Please take your time.
Before you go away, so far away
You need to realize

Baby it's not just you
You know it hurts me too.
Watching you leave
With tears on you sleeve.
Don't you notice mine aren't exactly dry!
Baby it's not just you
It's hurting.

It's me too.

I'm sorry
I wasn't there to catch the fall.
I didn't hear you when you called
All of those nights.
Please don't forget the good days with me
I can take back the heart aching grief.
When it gets dark and it's hard to see
I'll turn on the lights.

Before you go away, so far away
I really need you to know

Baby it's not just you
You know it hurts me too.
Watching you leave
With tears on your sleeve.
Don't you notice that mine aren't exactly dry!

Baby it's not just you.
It's hurting
It's me too.

I'm not giving up!
You don't have to leave!
I am willing to beg till I break my knees!
I believe in us!
Don't give up on me!

Girl I know that you're hurting.
And I'm sorry for the pain
I promise that I'll change
Forgive me, forgive me!

Baby it's not just you
You know it hurts me too.
Watching you leave
With tears on your sleeve.
Don't you notice that mine aren't exactly dry!
(Not exactly dry baby)
Baby it's not just you
You know it hurts me too.
We had it all
How could we fall

Baby I thought we would never die.
(Don't let it die)
Baby it's not just you
It's hurting.
It's me too.

Not just you.
Baby it's not just you.
Baby it's not just you.
Not just you.
Baby it's not just you.
Baby it's not just you.
Not just you.
Baby it's not just you.
Baby it's not just you.
