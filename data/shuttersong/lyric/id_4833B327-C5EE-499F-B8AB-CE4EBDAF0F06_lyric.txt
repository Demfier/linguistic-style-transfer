Ooh, there's so many things I want to do, to your body
Oh, I caught that glimpse you threw from across the room, yeah I caught it

Never have I been the one to be brutally honest
But really I just can't contain myself (uh uh)
You got a ice cold stare but you're hot like the tropics
If I approach you I'm afraid I'll melt (afraid I'll melt)
But that ain't stopping me, even if it should
Feeling good about the way you looking
The way that you looking at me
And you have got to be the best in the business the second I'm in this
You caught my attention like I just took an addy

Surrounded by flashing lights
They distract me from what I need (what I need)
And that's you girl, you girl (you), you girl
We can do this all night
You can wake up in my sheets yeah, oh yeah

Ooh, there's so many things I want to do, to your body
Oh, I caught that glimpse you threw from across the room, yeah I caught it
She's cold hearted, yeah, she's cold hearted
Cold hearted, yeah, but I still want it

Okay, walked in with a group of twenty
But you know that I'm leaving with just one individual (just you girl)
Looking for love, we're too young it is pitiful
Really are we trying to get attached? Can I get a no?
And I'm on it, hot pursuit
I saw the glimpse and I caught it and I got with you
Back at you with half a crew, it's absolute
You thinking I won't come back without a slap or two?
You're a top shelf girl, I put it on my life and I put it on the world
Quite apparent by the smile you wearing you're pretty confident
You're dancing on the tiles, I'm staring
My jaw's dropping and I thought it would be proper that I introduce myself
But I can't even hear my voice over the boom of the bass in the background
But if I could then I would tell you I'm Jack and as a matter of fact
I live with passion, how does that sound?

Ooh, there's so many things I want to do, to your body
Oh, I caught that glimpse you threw from across the room, yeah I caught it
She's cold hearted, yeah, she's cold hearted
Cold hearted, yeah, but I still want it
She's cold hearted, yeah, she's cold hearted
Cold hearted, yeah, but I still want it

Yeah, I'm a slow it down for you real quick (I'ma slow it down)
I'ma put it down on you real quick (I'ma put it down)
And I'ma show you what I'm all about, yeah
You didn't know you're about to find out, yeah
Ooh, there's so many things I want to do, to your body
Oh, I caught that glimpse you threw from across the room, yeah I caught it
She's cold hearted, yeah, she's cold hearted (caught that glimpse)
Cold hearted, yeah, but I still want it
She's cold hearted, yeah, she's cold hearted (cold hearted, cold hearted)
Cold hearted, yeah, but I still want it (cold hearted, I still want it)
