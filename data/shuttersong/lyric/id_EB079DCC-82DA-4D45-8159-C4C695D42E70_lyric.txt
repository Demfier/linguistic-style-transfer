You Gotta Feel It - Kevin Drew
When the silence wakes you up
You gotta feel it 
When the light won't give it up
You gotta feel it
When they force you down to sadness
You gotta feel it
And all the pain is specialized
You gotta feel it
Ooh  you're last to believe in this world
Will go down and fall again
Ooh  you're last to believe in this world
Will go down and fall again
When the roads don't know where go
You gotta feel it
And the thrill of love will come
You gotta feel it
When the silence breaks you up
You gotta feel it
And all the lies have given up
You gotta feel it
When they raise you up to sadness
You gotta feel it
And all the love is specialized
You gotta feel it
You gotta feel it
You gotta feel it
