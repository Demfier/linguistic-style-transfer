My heart's stolen

Uh, I said I got my heart stolen from a robber
With some high heels on
There's nothing I could do I couldn't stop her
From leading me on yeah

It's a love robbery (yeah)
It's a love robbery (lets go)
It's a love robbery (uh)
Yeah

Okay, the sun was setting; it was picture perfect when I met her
She had me thinking her and I was gonna be together
Forever? Wait hold up you thought this on the first date
Man I know its like she got me hooked right away
I, I couldn't see it coming like a sucker punch
Took my heart then she's out that's a hit and run
It's like I'm at the police department broken hearted
Time to figure out how it all started
Uh, 5'2 with some attitude
It's all good ‘cause honestly I think its kinda cute
Last seen in a little black dress
Watch out for those eyes, ‘cause she's armed and dangerous
Like bow, hit you with that one shot
Hands up she said give me everything you got
And then she'll dip like it never even happened
She can kill with those looks fatal attraction

Uh, I said I got my heart stolen from a robber

Okay we got a 2-11 in progress
Suspect is beautiful wanted for heart theft
My baby on the run, hold up why did I call her that
She did me so wrong and I still feel like I want her back
Okay I'm getting it back
matter of fact
I'm gonna write it all down in a rap
She thought she loved me
Now she's just a love thief
I let her in my heart was always open
Now I'm sitting here wondering how she could've stole it
Stole it like a sticker, sticker then she pulled the trigger
She had red lipstick and some heels kinda killer
I got love struck hit me good too
Do she love me do she love me not I never knew
But that's just how it goes when you fall for a heartbreaker
Who's heart has been broken before
Scared to open the door won't let nobody in

Yeah but will she ever learn to love again
