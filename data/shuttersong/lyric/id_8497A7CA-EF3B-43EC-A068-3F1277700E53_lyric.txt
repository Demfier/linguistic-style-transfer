I think perfections nice
But I'm human so I will improvise
So what it's not the bull's eye
Cause I sharpen my arrow with every try
And no I not afraid of rock bottom I forward in my mail there often
You pick up every thing letters and the left over pieces of me
Special delivery always in time you fit perfectly
I love the way I can't stop smiling you are all I need

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You are the best part of me
Checkmark how to define sweet

You help erase the times when I wishing can I push rewind
When I look in your eyes I believe there is more to life
Then settling for ordinary and I don't wanna stop

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You are the best part of me
Checkmark how to define
Sweet sweet sweet sweet
And I don't wanna throw it away

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You are the part of me
