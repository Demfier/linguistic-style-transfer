jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Hey!

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot

jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Sleigh, sleigh, sleigh, sleigh

jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
a one horse open sleigh
