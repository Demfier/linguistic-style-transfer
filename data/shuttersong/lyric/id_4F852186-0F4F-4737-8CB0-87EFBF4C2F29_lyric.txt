Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-ooooh!
Oh-woah-oh!

One tri
One tri
One tribe, one time, one planet, one race
It's all one blood, don't care about your face
The color of your eye or the tone of your skin
Don't care where you are, don't care where you been
'Cause where we gonna go is where we wanna be
The place where the little language is unity
And the continent is called Pangaea
And the main ideas are connected like a spear
No propaganda, they tried to upper hand us
'Cause man, I'm loving this peace
Man, man, I'm loving this peace
Man, man, I'm loving this peace

I don't need no leader that's gonna force feed
A concept that make me think I need to
Fear my brother and fear my sister

And shoot my neighbor or my big missile
If I had an enemy to, if I had an enemy to

If I had an enemy then my enemy is gonna try
To come and kill me 'cause I'm his enemy
There's one tribe y'all, one tribe y'all
One tribe y'all, we are one people

Let's cast amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's cast amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil that they feed ya, remember that we're one people

We are one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people

One tribe, one tribe, one tribe, one time, one planet, one race
Race, one love, one people, one and
Too many things that's causing one to
To forget about the main cause

Connecting, uniting
But the evil is seen and alive in us
So our weapons are colliding
And our peace is sinking like Poseidon

But, we know that the one, one
The evil one is threatened by the sum, sum
So he'll come and try and separate the sum

But he dumb, he didn't know we had a way to overcome
Rejuvenated by the beating of the drum

Come together by the cycle of the hum
Freedom when all become one, one forever
One tribe y'all, one tribe y'all
One tribe y'all, we are one people

Let's cast amnesia, forget about all that evil, evil
Forget about all that evil, evil that evil that they feed ya
Let's cast amnesia, forget about all that evil, evil
That evil, that they feed ya, feed ya, remember that we're one people

We are one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people

One love, one blood, one people
One heart, one beat, we equal
Connected like the Internet
United that's how we do

Let's break walls so we see through
Let love and peace lead you
We could overcome the complication
'Cause we need to

Help each other, make these changes
Brother, sister, rearrange this
The way I'm thinking
That we can change this bad condition

Wait, use you mind and not your greed
Let's connect and then proceed

This is something I believe
We are one, we're all just people
One tribe y'all, one tribe y'all
One tribe y'all, we are one people

Let's cast amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's cast amnesia, let's cast amnesia
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
One tribe y'all, we, we, we, we're one tribe y'all
One, one, one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people
One, one, one people
Let's, let's cast amnesia
Lord, help me out
Trying to figure out what it's all about
'Cause we're one in the same
Same joy, same pain
And I hope that You're there when I need Ya
'Cause maybe we need amnesia
And I don't wanna sound like a preacher
But we need to be one
One world, one love, one passion
One tribe, one understanding
'Cause you and me can become one
