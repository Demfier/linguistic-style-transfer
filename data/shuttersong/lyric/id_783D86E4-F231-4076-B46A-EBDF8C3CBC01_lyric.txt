Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate,
Trying to tell me to wait,
But I can't wait to see you.
So I run like I'm mad
To heaven's doors.
I don't want to be bad.
I won't cheat you no more.

Roses,
Bel Air,
Take me there.
I've been waiting to meet you.

Palm trees in the light,

I can see late at night,
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you,

Come to me, baby.

Spotlight, bad baby.
You've got a flair,
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there.

Mon amour, sweet child o' mine,
You're divine.

Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?
Roses,
Bel Air,
Take me there.
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light,
I can see late at night,
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you,
Come to me baby.
Don't be afraid of me.
Don't be ashamed.
Walking away of my soft resurrection.
Idol of roses, Iconic soul
I know your name.
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction.
Roses,
Bel Air,
Take me there.
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light,
I can see late at night,
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you,
Come to me baby.
Roses
Bel Air
Take me there.
I've been waiting to meet you.
Grenadine, sunshine.
Can you fade inside of mine?
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you,
Come to me baby.
