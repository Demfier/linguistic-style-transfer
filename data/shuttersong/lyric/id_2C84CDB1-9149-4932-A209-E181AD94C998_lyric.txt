I've shown you all the places I'm dreaming of
I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are 17, we have just begun
I have loved a five, four and then some
you are the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there will be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal

An animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth
I'll colour in the sky, and I'll colour you
I want to join your skin again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal

An animal

We will run away from danger
We will run away

I-I-I-I-I will fight for...

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal
An animal
