It's a little past supper time
I'm still out on the porch step
Sittin' on my behind, waiting for you
Wondering if everything was alright
Momma said come in boy don't waste your time
I said I got time he'll be here soon
Five years old and talkin' to myself
Where were you? Where'd ya go?

Daddy can't ya tell?
I'm not tryin' to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame

No there's no one home

In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my scripts been rearranged
No there's no one home
In my house of pain

No there's no one home
In my house of pain

Wasn't I worth the time?
A boy needs a daddy like dance to mime
And all the time I looked up to you
I paced my room a million times
And all I ever got was one big line
The same old lie
How could you?
Well I was eighteen and still talkin' to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy can't ya tell?
I'm not tryin' to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my scripts been rearranged
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
I'm not tryin' to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my scripts been rearranged
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
I'm alone again
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
No there's no one home
In my house of pain
I'm alone again
If I learned anything from this
Is how to live on my own!
