We're all bored
We're also tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better
We're so young that we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

'Cause baby I could build a castle

Out of all the brick they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the New Romantics
Come on, come on along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the New Romantics

The best people in life are free
We're all here

The light and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker, you can't see in my face
But I'm about to play my ace
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up and switch up sides like a record changer

The rumors, are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true
'Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the brick they threw at me

And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the New Romantics
Come on, come on along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing

To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the New Romantics

The best people in life are free
So come on, come on along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded it's so romantic
'Cause baby I could build the castle

Out of all the brick they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
'Cause baby I could build the castle
Out of all the brick they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the New Romantics
Come on, come on along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the New Romantics
The best people in life are free
