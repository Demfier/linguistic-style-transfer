If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
Leave it up to them to fill up their steeple
Leave it up to us to fill up on our friends

If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
I live in my mind that I know there's no equal
When I'm falling out, yo they pull me back in

It was long ago
And we were younger so
And our lives we part wrote
Feel it, feeling
Yeah

And I remember everyday
Sometimes it's too much to take
I break down, without heartache
And I mean it, and I mean it

If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
Leave it up to them to fill up their steeple
Leave it up to us to fill up on our friends

If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
I'm within my mind that I know there's no equal
When I'm falling out, yo they pull me back in

They say we've had fun but let this go
Music don't go deep but no
We think we could help this world if only we try
But we grow up
At least that's what they say
We can't do this when we pray
But I tell myself every day that none of that applies

If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
Leave it up to them to fill up their steeple
Leave it up to us to fill up on our friends

If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
I'm within my mind that I know there's no equal
When I'm falling out, yo they pull me back in

All I really need
It's all I have ever seen
Only thing works for me
Is to feel it, feeling
And when we turn to leave
And others turn to be its always on my sleeve
And I mean it, And I mean it
If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
Leave it up to them to fill up their steeple
Leave it up to us to fill up on our friends
If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
I'm within my mind that I know there's no equal
When I'm falling out, yo they pull me back in
