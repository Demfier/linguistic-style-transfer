Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Let's set it off
Oh yeah
You can make it happen

Ohay, ohay hey!
Kings and Queens, it's our time to rise
Write the book story of our lives,
This is us taking back the night.
Ohay, ohay
Break the spell,
We were born this way
Be yourself, forget the DNA,
Everybody raise your hands and say
Ohay, ohay

Sound the alarm, get on your feet
Let's set it off and rock this beat
Dance till your heart is wild and free
Ooh, oh, oh
Feeling the power, let it all out,
Like what you see in the mirror, shout
We got the keys, the kingdom's ours
Ooh, oh, oh,
Ohay, ohay hey

Let's set it off
Oh yeah
Start a chain reaction,
Never let it stop!
Let's set it off
Oh yeah
You can make it happen
With everything you got!
Let's set it off!

Get ready, set it off
Come on
We got to set it off
On the right
Get ready, set it off
To the left
We got to set it off!
Ohay ohay hey!

Yo, it's time to set this thing off,
Let's make it happen now
I'mma make my own future, ignore the rumors,
Show 'em how passion sound
They all told me I should back down
Judgin' me 'cause of my background
Thinkin' 'bout changing my path now
I ain't goin' out like that now

Feeling the power, let it all out,
Like what you see in the mirror, shout
We got the keys, the kingdom's ours
Ooh oh oh

Oh yeah
Let's set it off
Oh yeah
Let's set this off!
Start a chain reaction,
Never let it stop!
Let's set it off
Let's set this off!
