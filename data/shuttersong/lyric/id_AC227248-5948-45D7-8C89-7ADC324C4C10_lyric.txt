Spotless Mind - Jhen¨¦ Aiko\n Change is inevitable\n Why hold on to what you have to let go of \n Like  did I really break your heart \n Was it all my fault \n If you don't knock it off\n You know like I know where this was headed\n I'm a wanderer\n I'm a wanderer  baby\n Wanderer\n I'm a wanderer\n Flying kite was nice\n Turquoise trees and ocean breezes\n Loving you was nice\n But it's a new day  a new season\n I've been sad inside\n And he could see it  picked up your pieces\n We are just alive\n And alright  alright  alright\n I'm a wanderer\n I'm a wanderer  baby\n Wanderer\n I'm a wanderer\n Started as a love song  started\n 26 years in the making\n Moving from place to places\n Never really settled down\n Without a place to come home\n I got so used to the changes\n Moving from stranger to strangest\n You can face it\n I am so crazy\n I'm a wanderer\n I'm a wanderer  baby\n Wanderer\n I'm a wanderer\n Shame on me for changing\n No  shame on you for staying the same\n Shame on me for changing\n No  shame on you for staying the same\n I'm a wanderer\n I'm a wanderer  baby\n Wanderer\n I'm a wanderer
