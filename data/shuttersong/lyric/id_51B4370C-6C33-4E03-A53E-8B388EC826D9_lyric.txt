And I can't even call it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic

I got the vodka and soda, hold it up high like a rock in minnesota
outside coppers in rovers, i don't give a fuck _ _ I'm tryna see HOVA
my songs gunna be all over, bitches its a wrap, bout to be all over
ya dead wrong if your sober hoes stay back show Grace like Topher
so tonight we gon get a case of ace of spades, spray lames in the fucking face
and tonight we might catch a case, get laced like we just won the fucking race
so if you ride like we ride and tonight be the night got you going in heavy heavy
grab a dime or a nine have the time of your life let it flow, with no levy levy

And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic

my attitude is FUCK IT, mother fuckers gon love it

I never gave a shit like Britney Spears in public
Gon' be on top like we about to raise a summit
my fans know words while yours be hummin'
my man buy me Loubs while yours be bummin'
got twice as many pairs as you I'm doublin'
get twice as many stares like gazelle make you run it
im gonna twerk I'm getting lit gonna work stay getting it
you a jerk get your own licks, you a lerch check your own piss
aint got a care in the world
middle finger up - skater girl
sippin liquor up - faded girl
hitting better bud - later girl

And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic

Pour it in my cup hold it up, way up
Liquor, Liquor, Liquor, Liquor
let me see you get drunk, let me see you man up
Liquor, Liquor, Liquor, Liquor
toast to the night, DJ got us on a high
Liquor, Liquor, Liquor, Liquor

And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even all it, every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
