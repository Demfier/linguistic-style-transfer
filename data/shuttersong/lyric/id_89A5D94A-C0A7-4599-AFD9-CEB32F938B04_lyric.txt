Where'd you go, huh?
They all think I know you
It's so hard to motivate
Me to devote a
Single inch of me to
Something I can't see I
Don't mean to pry but
Why would you even make the eyes?
I don't believe my ears
And I'm scared of my own head
I will deny you for years
Then I'll make you raise me from the dead
And if I said that I would live for you for nothing in return
Well I'm sorry Mr. Gullible
But lying's all I've learned
So be concerned
So be concerned
No music

And I could talk about anything
Whether or not it's worth while
Is based on who's listening
Most of us listen if it's something we can relate to
All of us relate if it's something we've just been through
Take it for granted
Trust is damaged and now we panic
Living empty-handed
Living lives like we can't manage
I can't feel you but still know where home is
Feeling like Jonah did
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded.
So be concerned
So be concerned
I am disappearing inside my bird's eye theories

I try to say goodbye, defy, and deny what it is I'm fearing

Clearly I am dying
Dearly I am writing
Merely testifying
That the test to fly requires I pass the test with colors flying
I don't believe you
Most the time I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine
You are the pearl
I am the swine
So break my life and take this rhyme
I'm so sorry
But I do believe
That all my bridges
I have burned
And I've earned a policy of no return
So be concerned
So be concerned
So be concerned
So be concerned
