This F**kin Song (explicit) - The Janoskians
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
I'm never gonna pick up baby go ahead and give up
'Cause you're never gonna get a second chance
You weren't even wasted when you said I'd never make it
So I guess I gotta prove that I'm the man
You treat me like a hobby and you're telling everybody
That you didn't really love me like that
I'm about to change my number
And I bet that you're gonna wonder why
I never ever called your ass back
You're gonna miss me when my song's on the radio
You're gonna hate this fucking song
It goes like
La da da da da da
You said you loved me
La da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You're gone hate this fucking song
I don't think you get it but I meant it when I said it
That you're never gonna get a second try
You said I was a zero but I'm gonna be a hero when I
Hit the red button every time
You're gonna miss me when my song's on the radio
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
I just can't wait until you hear me the stereo
You're gonna hate this fucking song
It goes like
La da da da da da
You said you loved me
La da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You're gone hate this fucking song
And get a job baby
And I was never gone live in my dreams
Look in your itunes and under my songs
All you had was adam levine's
So baby don't despair 'cause I see you
When you show up at my shows
You screwed up 'cause I blew up
And you blew up my phone
That's karma
I just can't wait until you hear me the stereo
You're gonna hate this fucking song
It goes like
La da da da da da
You said you loved me
La da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You're gone hate this fucking song
You said you loved me
La da da da da da
You love me not
La da da da da da
I wrote this melody
You're trying not to sing along
You're gone hate this fucking song
