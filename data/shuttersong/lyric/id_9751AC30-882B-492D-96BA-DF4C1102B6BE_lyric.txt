Woke up to the same old uh oh
Heartbreak cause I won't let go-oh
Six weeks and I still don't know
Who or where we went wrong

Lovesick and I feel so uh-oh
That's it gotta let you go-oh
All good but I still don't know
Who or where we went wrong

One thousand hours, thirteen minutes
Twenty seconds, I finally went and did it
It's about time I finally got over you

Oh I wish
I wish you the best you're freaking useless
If I only ever had one wish, just one wish
I wish I could
Go back, I'm so over everything we had
But if I only ever had one wish, then I'd wish
I'd never met you at all

I wish I'd never met you at all

Crossed you with a cheerio
Hello that means goodbye
