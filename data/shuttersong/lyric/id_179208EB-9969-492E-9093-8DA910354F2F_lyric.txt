Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames (in flames)

Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now

I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Said I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Take a chance let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, put a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette

Pawnshop heart trading up (trading up)
On the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth free love on the streets

But in the alley it ain't that cheap, now
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Said I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Said I don't care just what you think as long as it's about me
Said I don't care just what you think as long as it's about me

Said I don't care (I don't care)
Said I don't care (I don't care)
Said I (I) don't (don't) care (care)
I (I) don't (don't) care (care)
I don't care, (Said I don't care)
Said I (I) don't (don't) care (care)
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
