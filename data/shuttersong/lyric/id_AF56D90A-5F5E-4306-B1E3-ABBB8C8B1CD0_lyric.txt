True Love - Coldplay
For a second  I was in control
I had it once  I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise
And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now 
You let me go but one last time
Tell me you love me 
If you don't then lie to me lie to me
Remember once upon a time 
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes and mine
So tell me you love me
And if you don't then lie to me  lie to me
Just tell me you love 
If you don't then lie to me  lie to me
If you don't then lie to me  lie to me
And call it true  call it true love
Call it true  call it true love
