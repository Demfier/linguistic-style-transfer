Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Picadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night
Night turns to whatever we want

We're young enough to say
Oh
This has gotta be the good life

This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh
Got this feeling that you can't fight

Like this city is on fire tonight

This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh ohhh
To my friends in New York I say hello

My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out

Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me-e-e
What there's to complain about
When you're happy like a fool

Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in
Oh

This has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

I say oh
Got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is a fine night
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh ohhh
Oh good, good life
Please, oh yeah, oooh

Hopelessly I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'cause hopelessly the hope is we have so much to feel good about

Oh
This has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

I say oh
Got this feeling
That you can't fight
Like this city is a fine night

This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh yeah
Good, good life
Good life
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh
Listen
To my friends in New York I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado?
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me-e-e
What there's to complain about?
