Lay down your slow
Come settle down, settle down
Let loose your glow
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat
Spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat
You and me
Caught up in a dream
In a technicolour beat

Beat
Beat
Beat

Warm unalone
Come settle down, settle down
Swing me your bones
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat
Spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat
You and me
Caught up in a dream
In a technicolour beat

Beat

Give me one drop
I can feel you
Make me lose control
We be walking
On the water
We're moving in a technicolour beat
Moving in a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat
(Falling off the ceiling)
Spinning on our feet
(We're moving)
In a technicolour beat
You and me
(Found another feeling)
Caught up in a dream
In a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat
Spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat
You and me
Caught up in a dream
In a technicolour beat

Beat
Beat
