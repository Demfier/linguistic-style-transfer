Ooooooooouuuh

Ooooouuuuuuhhhhh
Can you feel me?
When I think about you
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do

My world is an empty place
Like I've been wanderin' the desert
For a thousand days (oooh)
Don't know if its a mirage

But I always see your face
BABAY!
I'm missing you so much
Cant help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive

A day without you is like a year without rain (oooh)

Woooooooooaaahhhh
The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry

Catch me I'm falling
It's like the ground is grumbling underneath my feet, (Won't you save me)
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me (ooooh baby)
I missing you so much

Cant help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain (ooh)
Wooooooooaaah...
So let this drought come to an end

And make this desert flower again

I'm so glad you found me, stick around me
Baby, baby, baby (ooooohh)

It's a world of wonder
With you in my life
So hurry baby
Don't waste no more time

And I need you here I
Can't explain
A day without you
Is like a year without rain (oooh)
I missing you so much
Can't help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain (oooohh)
Woooooooah.
Oooooooooooooooooooooh Oooohhh (Woooaaaahhh)
