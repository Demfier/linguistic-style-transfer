I'll swim and sail on savage seas
With never a fear of drowning
And gladly ride the waves of life
If you will marry me.
No scorching sun
Or freezing cold
Will stop me on my journey
If you will promise me your heart
And love me for eternity.
My dearest one,
My darling dear,
Your mighty words astound me.
But I've no need of mighty deeds
When I feel your arms around me!
But I would bring you rings of gold
I'd even sing you poerty
And I would keep you from all harm!
If you would stay beside me!
I have no use for rings of gold,
I care not for your poetry,
I only want your hand to hold
I only want you near me!
La-la La-la La-la La-la La-la
To love and kiss!
To sweetly hold!
For the dancing and the dreaming!
Through all those horrors and those nights!
I'd keep your love beside me!
I'll swim and sail on savage seas
With Never a fear of drowning,
And gladly ride the waves of life
If you would marry me!
