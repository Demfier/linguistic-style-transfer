You seem to replace
Your brain with your heart
You take things so hard
And then you fall apart
You try to explain
But before you can start
Those cry baby tears
Come out of the dark
Something's turning the handle
To that faucet in your eyes
You pour it out
Where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body
It's why you won't feel inside
You pour it out
Where everyone can see

They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground

You just let them drown
You're all on your own and
You lost all your friends
You told yourself that

It's not you, it's them
You're one of a kind
And no one understands
But those cry baby tears
Keep coming back again
Something's turning the handle
To that faucet in your eyes
You pour it out

Where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body
It's why you won't feel inside
You pour it out

Where everyone can see
They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby

So you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You just let them drown
I look at you and
I see myself

I know you better
Than anyone else

I have same the faucet
In my eyes
So your tears
Are mine

They call me cry baby, cry baby
But I don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
I laugh through my tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause I don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
I just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
I just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
They call you cry baby, cry baby
I just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
