A material girl
In her own world
Can't even see the things she's missing
Right in the curve
A little girl, wanting to grow up
And be a star
Take a look around
Stop looking down
All these things have blurred your vision
Material things don't go up to nothing

But I know how you feel
It's hard to see what's real

It takes time (time) living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time (time), slow it down
And don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time, takes time to love

And I'm a tell the truth
When it comes to you, my lady
And it's a miracle
You have found a conscience, baby
I had a plan on leaving
You came and gave a reason
Now I know the reason why

But I know how you feel (you feel)
It's hard to see what's real
(What's real, yeah)

It takes time (time) living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time (time), slow it down
And don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time (takes time)
Takes time (takes time) to love (love)
