Raised By Wolves - U2
Face down on a broken street
There's a man in the corner
In a pool of misery
I'm in a white van as a red sea
Covers the ground
Metal crash I can't tell
What it is
But I take a look
And now I'm sorry I did
5:30 on a Friday night 33
Good people cut down
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
Face down on a pillow of shame
There are some girls
With a needle trying to spell my
Name
My body's not a canvas
My body's now a toilet wall
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
Boy sees his father crushed
Under the weight
Of a cross in a passion
Where the passion is hate
Blue mink Ford 
I'm gonna detonate in your den
Blood in the house
Blood in the street
The worst things in the world
Are justified by belief
Registration 1385-WZ
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
