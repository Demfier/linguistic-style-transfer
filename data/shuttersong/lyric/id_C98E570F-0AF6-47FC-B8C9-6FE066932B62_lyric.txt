I can still taste you
Like it was yesterday
Makin' plans to rule the world
You were more than I deserved
I see you
Runnin' in the sand
Long hair blowing in the wind
Never thought that it would end

Leaves fall from
The tallest trees
Even mountains crumble
Into the sea
Holding on
To memories
And I can't let go

I wanna get back to where we started
To the summer night
You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right
Yeah, I wanna get back to San Francisco
In the firelight
You know, you know, you know, you know we had it right

Remember that weekend
When we got out of town?
We drove into infinity
I held you 'til you fell asleep
Without you
The smell of your perfume
Reminds me of when we were free
I swear that it's still haunting me

Leaves fall from
The tallest trees
Even mountains crumble
Into the sea
Holding on
To memories
And I can't let go

I wanna get back to where we started
To the summer night
You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right
Yeah, I wanna get back to San Francisco
In the firelight
You know, you know, you know, you know we had it right

We don't gotta say anything
Don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all
Don't say a word at all
We don't gotta say anything
Don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all

Don't say a word at all
I wanna get back to where we started
To the summer night

You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right
I wanna get back to where we started
To the summer night
You know, you know, you know, you know we got it right
Yeah, I wanna get back to San Francisco
In the firelight

You know, you know, you know, you know we had it right
We don't gotta say anything
Don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all
Don't say a word at all
We don't gotta say anything
Don't gotta say anything
Don't say a word at all
Don't say a word at all
