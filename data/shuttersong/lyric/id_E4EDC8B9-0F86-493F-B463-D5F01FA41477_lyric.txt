Gargoyles  standing in the front of your gate 
Trying to tell me to wait 
But I can't wait to see you 
So I run  like I'm mad 
To heavens door 
I don't wanna be bad 
I won't cheat you no more 
Roses  Bel Air  take me there 
I have been waiting to meet you 
Palm trees  in the light 
I can sleep  late at night 
Darling I'm waiting to greet you 
Come to me  baby
Spot light  bad baby
You've got a flare
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
No more sweet child of mine
You're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine 
Roses  Bel Air  take me there 
I have been waiting to meet you 
Palm trees  in the light 
I can sleep  late at night 
Darling I'm waiting to greet you 
Come to me  baby
Don't be afraid of me
Don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Hide all the roses 
I counted so I know your name 
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction 
Roses  Bel Air  take me there 
I have been waiting to meet you 
Palm trees  in the light 
I can sleep  late at night 
Darling I'm waiting to greet you 
Come to me  baby
Roses  Bel Air  take me there 
I have been waiting to meet you 
Remedy is sunshine  and you fade inside of mine 
Darling I'm waiting to greet you 
Come to me  baby
