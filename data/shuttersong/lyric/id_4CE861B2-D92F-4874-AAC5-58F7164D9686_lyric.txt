I can tell that you're a sinner
From behind your angel eyes
A beautiful deceiver
But I can handle anything you try

Your finger's on my trigger
You play it like a winner
You're pulling me tight

Let's stop talking about it
Just stop thinking about it
Let's get crazy about it

I got you now
I'm gonna take you to the edge tonight
I, I'll show you how
So won't you come with me tonight
Come with me tonight, oh oh oh
Come with me tonight

There's no limit to forever
And there's no ceiling in the sky
We'll hit the finish line together
Way beyond the morning light

Your finger's on my trigger
You play it like a winner
You're pulling me tight

Let's stop talking about it
Just stop thinking about it
Let's get crazy about it

I got you now
I'm gonna take you to the edge tonight
I, I'll show you how
So won't you come with me tonight
Come with me tonight, oh oh oh
Come with me tonight

Oh oh oh
Tonight, tonight
Come with me tonight
Tonight,
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Tonight,
Come with me
Tonight,
Come with me

Are you coming?

I got you now
I'm gonna take you to the edge tonight
I, I'll show you how
So won't you come with me tonight, oh oh oh
Come with me tonight, oh oh oh
Come with me tonight.
(Come with me tonight)
Come with me tonight
(Come with me tonight)
Come with me tonight
(Come with me tonight)
