Tough girl
In the fast lane
No time for love
No time for hate
No drama
No time for games
Tough girl
Whose soul aches i m at home
On my own
Check my phone
Nothing though
Act busy
Order in
Pay TV
It's agony
I may cry ruining my makeup

Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

Tough girl

I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top
Black outs and airplanes
I still pour you
A glass of champagne
Tough girl
Whose soul aches i m at home
On my own
Check my phone
Nothing though
Act busy
Order in
Pay TV

It's agony
I may cry ruining my makeup

Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
I wake up

Alone ...

I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
