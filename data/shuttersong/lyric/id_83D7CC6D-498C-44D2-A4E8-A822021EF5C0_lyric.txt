Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl
Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

Red was the color of her eyes
When she put me in a meditation state
Her skin is white, so light
Look like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
When it's time for feeding and her body wakes
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

(Pre-)
So evil in the dress
It circulates, you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh
Once she starts to revoke the spirits
Got you on the floor
She comes alive when you're the killing
Hungry for some more

I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you

It makes me say
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
It makes me say
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried
Find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got the bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect blood mate

Your pheromones invaded my instict
I stalked your scent like an animal
Rose me in your perfection, I'm mad I don't wanna wake
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold the candle

It feels like…
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold the candle
Sometimes it feels like
Smells so funky
Guitar
Give it to me
Break
Heeey…
Aw, come on
So so good

I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you

It makes me say
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
It makes me say
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl
Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

Give it to me

Now that you got me
Tell me what you're gonna do with me
I taste your blood
And found out you was the perfect fit
Come on mama
Show me what you're workin with
Come on mama
Go and show me what you're workin with
Show me what you're workin with

True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…

Now that you got me
Tell me what you're gonna do with me
'Cause I can taste your blood
I found out you were my perfect fit
Come on mama
Show me what you're workin with
I said come on mama
Come on, show me what you're workin with

We got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)

We got that (true blood)
She hit me with the (true blood)
She got that (true blood)

She got that (true blood)

True blood… true blood…
