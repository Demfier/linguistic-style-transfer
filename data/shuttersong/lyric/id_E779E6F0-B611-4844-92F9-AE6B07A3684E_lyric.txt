I've been walking in the same way
As I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear 
Is there anyone I could call "
"No and thank you' please Madam 
I ain't lost' just wandering"
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
I like it in the city when
The air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody
In short skirts'shorts and shades
I like it in the city when
Two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Do  Di le di de  
Do  Di le di de  
Do    Ooh   
Yeah    
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah  
Of my world
Of my world
Yeah
