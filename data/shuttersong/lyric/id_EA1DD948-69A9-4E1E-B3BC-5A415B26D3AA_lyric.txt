Secret Agent Man - Johnny Rivers
Album by: The Original Johnny Rivers
Artist by: Johnny Rivers
There's a man who leads a life of danger
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every move he makes another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man secret agent man
They've given you a number and taken away your name
Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Ah be careful what you say
Or you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man secret agent man
They've given you a number and taken away your name
------ lead guitar ------
Secret agent man secret agent man
They've given you a number and taken away your name
Swinging on the Riviera one day
And then laying in the Bombay alley next day
Oh no you let the wrong word slip
While kissing persuasive lips
The odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man secret agent man
They've given you a number and taken away your name
Secret agent man
