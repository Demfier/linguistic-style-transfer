I saw a spider
I didn't scream
Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me, and
I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down
Cause they just get in my way

The way
You look at me is kinda like a little sister
Your highfives, your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys

So over the summer something changed
I started reading seventeen, and
Shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school, and
Caught you staring at me

Cause I know
What you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay
Maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring

Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
A homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream
And not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be...

Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys
