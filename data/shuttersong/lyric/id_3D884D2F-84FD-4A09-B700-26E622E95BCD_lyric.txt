Well the truth.
Well it hurts to say.
I'm gonna pack up my bags.
And I'm gonna go away.
I'm gonna split.
I can't stand it.
I'm gonna giving it up and quit.
And ain't never coming back.
But before I get going.
I got to say.
I know you use to love me.
But that was yesterday.
And the truth. I won't fight it.
When the love stop burning.
And you got to do what's right.

Lover, lover, lover.
You don't treat me no good no more.
(No good, no more.)
Lover, lover, lover.
You don't treat me no good no more.

Now the truth.
It hurt to say.
I'm gonna pack up my bags.
And I'm gonna go away.
I'm going to split.
I can't stand it.
I'm going giving it up and quitting.
And ain't never coming back.
But before I get going.
I got to say.
I know you use to love me.
But that was yesterday.
And the truth.
I won't fight it.
When the love stop burning.
And you got to do what's right.

But before I get going.
And I got to say.
There was a time baby when you.
Use to shake it for me me but now.
All you do is you treat me cold.
Ain't gonna take it no more.
Gonna walk out the door.

Lover, lover, lover.
You don't treat me no good no more.
(No good, no more.)
Lover, lover, lover.
You don't treat me no good no more.

I wake up blue.
Almost every night.
And I'm hurting so bad.
'Cause you don't treat me right.
You know I hate to go.
But you're so mean to me baby.

Lover, lover, lover.
You don't treat me no good no more.
(No good, no more.)
Lover, lover, lover.
You don't treat me no good no more.
