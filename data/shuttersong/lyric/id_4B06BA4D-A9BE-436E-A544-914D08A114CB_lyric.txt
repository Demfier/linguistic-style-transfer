Take the day and turn instead
To the adventure you playground dreamt
Where have I seen this all before?

Take the day and listen in
To all those that stand and grin
Where have I seen this all before?
In lines of poets who write no more

Fall back retreat
And come back to me
Fall back retreat
Won't you come back to me
Fall back retreat
And come back to me

Oh mother of love
I wish I knew your child
Do you remember my name?
I hope we meet one day
Oh mother of love
I wish I knew your child
Do you remember my name?
I hope we meet one day

Take your day and turn instead
to the adventure and playground dreamt
Where have I seen this all before?
