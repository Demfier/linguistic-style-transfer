I've got a question, tell me why, you always fall for the bad guy?
It's cuz you like it, yeah you like it.
When I look at other girls walking by I say hello, cause you don't mind it, I think you like it I don't know why you like it.
By the way, last week Saturday, was our Anniversary, I was playing GTA.
Damn I'm Sorry.
Would you love me, Would you love me.
If I wasn't such a jerk?
But you love me, yeah you love me cuz you like it when it hurts.
Try to be, all but nice.
But it doesn't seem to work.
Would you tell me that you love me, If I wasn't such a jerk?
I DON'
T THINK SO!!
I DON'
T THINK SO!!
I used to treat you like a queen, but it never worked out right for me.
You didn't like it, you never liked it.
I know you're parent's hate my life, but it always seems to make you smile, Because you like it, I guess you like it I don't know why you like it.
By the way, coming up on Saturday, isn't it your birthday?
I'll be playing GTA.
Damn I'm Sorry.
Would you love me, Would you love me.
If I wasn't such a jerk?
But you love me, yeah you love me cuz you like it when it hurts.
Try to be, all but nice.
But it doesn't seem to work.
Would you tell me that you love me, If I wasn't such a jerk?

All I do is
BLAH!
