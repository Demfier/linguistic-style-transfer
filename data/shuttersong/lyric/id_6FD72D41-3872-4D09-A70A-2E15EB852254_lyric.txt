And I'll bruise jaws like ooh oh (Really Like)
Who her? I'm a true star
This bitch broad got blue balls
Hard pressed ‘cause I took off

Slay the beat ‘cause these wannabees
Wanna be the buzz
Angels need Jesus, angles, features
Live show, PR, they made the baby,
You can't beat us
That New York, that new ones
That new story, that
212 to get blue blood
Beautiful in my own hood
Up the hill it's all good
Up the bills, been born touring
From fucking where? Who are you?
Bad queen is my pedigree
Bad bitch is my legacy
You mad bitch, you average
A rap bitch I'm wrackin'
Stacking money, makin' Manhattan
Mama cakin' that cash in
You ask him or ask him, I get it in
Harlem might citizen
You sloppy dyke, you wanna lick a bitch
You probably bite, I ain't about it bitch
You not my type, I need a hotter bitch
From New York with it born and breed to get it
A home front with it I flipp em and get that spinach
Move y'all bitches and beatin' ‘em with the fitted
Ooh yah bitches they leavin' you with that

What's working girls? I'm a boss bitch
Got foreigners in my office

This City charm, I'm gorgeous
Like really though, you a corn bitch
One wish movin' on, it's a warning
Be honest, your garments be garbage,
Top draft she lack class poof poof be gone bitch
We on this, she came here, we own this
I claim here, it's my home pit
Top pit, that chocolate banks baby deposit
AB ‘bout that profit, not gossip
This that, stars to the Hollywood red carpet

All these bitches wanna know how she get that
Don't ask for the price, let me get that
You a man with your dick back
You a sam with a slick back
You a ham in the pig shack
You a scam for the kit kat
Little Bam 100 grand is champion chit chat
Stylin' is something you see not evolve
Diamonds is shinin', they frigged they froze
Wildn' I'm stuntin' and spending that dough
And when I step in them bitches, them bitches they know
Diamonds is shinin', they frigged they froze
