Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

Passion burning
Causing rapture of laughter
Pressure building
Falling faster and faster

If I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word, baby
And I got you, hey, darlin' I got ya

Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

Chapters turning
So old-fashioned, and natural
Potions got me, fallin' for ya, baby

If I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word, baby
And I got you

Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

Baby, baby, love me, shade me
Keep me wrapped up in your open arms
Come on, baby, gave me, something amazing
But don't mistake me for someone, for the next girl, nah

We don't fight, we just fuck
I'm in like, she's in love
She gave in, I gave up
Can we just live in the moment?
