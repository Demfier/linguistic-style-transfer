 I'm gonna make you bend and break
Say  a  prayer  but  let  the  good  times  roll
In  case  God  doesn't  show
 And   I  want  these  words  to   make  things  right
But  it's  the  wrongs  that   make  the  words  come  to  life
Who  does  he  think  he  is
If  that's  the  worst   you've  got  better  put  your  fingers  back  to  the  keys
One  night   and  one  more  time
Thanks  for  the  memories
Even  though  they  weren't  so  great
He  tastes  like   you  only  sweeter
One  night  yeah   and  one  more  time
Thanks  for  the  memories
Thanks  for  the  memories
See  he  tastes  like   you  only  sweeter
Ohhhhhh
Been  looking  forward  to  the  future
But  my  eyesight  is  going  bad
In  this  crystal  ball
It's  always  cloudy  except  for £¨except  for£©
When   you  look  into  the  past £¨look  into  the  past£©
One  night  stand £¨One  night  stand  off!£©
One  night   and  one  more  time
Thanks  for  the  memories
Even  though  they  weren't  so  great
He  tastes  like   you  only  sweeter
One  night  yeah  one  more  time
Thanks  for  the  memories
Thanks  for  the  memories
See  he  tastes  like   you  only  sweeter
ohhhh
£¨They  say£© I  only  think  in  the  form  of  crunching  numbers
In  hotel  rooms  collecting  page-six  lovers
Get  me  out  of  my  mind
Get   you  out  of  those  clothes
 I 'm  a  line  away
From  getting   you  into  the  mood £¨wa-ooooohhh£©
One  night   and  one  more  time
Thanks  for  the  memories
Even  though  they  weren't  so  great
He  tastes  like   you  only  sweeter
One  night  yeah  one  more  time
Thanks  for  the  memories

See  he  tastes  like   you  only  sweeter
One  night   and  one  more  time
