I was jammin
on my guitar
but it turned into a love song
baby ooh…
I was thinkin about you…

lips o'sugar
only sweeter
you're the portrait
of my dream girl baby
ooh…
I was thinkin about you

I don't wanna know you as anything but my baby
don't wanna see you with another guy
the way you make me feel is so amazing
and when I look into your big blue eyes…

wish you were mo-o-o-o-o-ore
mo-o-o-o-o-ore
wish you were mo-o-o-o-o-ore
more than a friend

Then you caught me
in a day dream
kind a funny
I'm just sayin, baby…
ooh…
I was dreaming about you…

Hair was blowin
It was perfect
skin was glowin
in the sunset baby
ooh…
I was dreamin about you.

I don't wanna know you as anything but my baby
don't wanna see you with another guy
the way you make me feel is so amazing
and when I look into your big blue eyes…

wish you were mo-o-o-o-o-ore
mo-o-o-o-o-ore
wish you were mo-o-o-o-o-ore
more than a friend

You come runnin' to me
when you've been cryin from him
I make you smile, but deep deep down,
I wanna be more than a friend.
Yeah…
I wanna be more than a friend

mo-o-o-o-o-ore
mo-o-o-o-o-ore
wish you were mo-o-o-o-o-ore
more than a friend

I really wish you were
I really wish you were
mo-o-o-o-o-ore
mo-o-o-o-o-ore
ooh…
wish you were mo-o-o-o-o-ore
more than a friend

Girl you should be
mo-o-o-o-o-ore
mo-o-o-o-o-ore
wish you were mo-o-o-o-o-ore
more than a friend
