Win me with a smile,
Burn me with your eyes.
Living just to please.
Turn and make me leave.

"When I'm high, I'm high.
When I'm low, I'm low."
Hot or cold, It's going to show.

Promise everything
Until tomorrow comes again.
I won't ask for love,
I know it's there, just covered up.

"When I'm high, I'm high.
When I'm low, I'm low."
Hot or cold, It's going to show.

Feeling like a child.
Tremble in the night.
I love you but you try,
to kill me every time.
Turn around and end as you begin.
Promise nothing.
