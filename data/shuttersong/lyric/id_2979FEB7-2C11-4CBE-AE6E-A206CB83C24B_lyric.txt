Looking out the window
Waiting for your hand lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really going down tonight

You're scared I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're travelling here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you warm
When the only thing that I really need
Is to have your arms right around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas

Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pindrop
Set for the clock on the wall

And i'm scared I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're travelling here through the winter snow

Baby think of me if it helps to get you warm
When the only thing that I really need
Is to have your arms right around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas

I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and i
Through christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just have you here
I'll waiting

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're travelling here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you warm
When the only thing that I really need
Is to have your arms right around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas

Looking out the window
