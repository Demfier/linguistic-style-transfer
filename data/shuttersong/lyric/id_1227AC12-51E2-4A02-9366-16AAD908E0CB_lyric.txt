Y'all woke me up from nappin'
I thought I told ya I quit rappin'
But now it sounds like somethin's happen'
Got my hands snappin', toes tappin'
Okay, so I guess I'll play the captain
(Buckle up)
Now get your asses strapped in
Ya, I'll keep it sweet as freakin' sacchrine
Time for some action
I ain't even actin'
Hey, so you want some satisfaction?
25 years, still got 'em packed in
Them other kids thought they had us all backed in
Shit, better call the freakin' chaplain
Hey, they got it backwards like a strap chin
Still keep them moist, need a napkin
From Boston to Aspen
