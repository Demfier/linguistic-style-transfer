Life is life
And it goes so fast
So reach out and grab it
While supplies lasts
You're still here
And I like your face
It's kind of loud in here
Let's get out of this place
Cause roses are red
Roses are red most of the time
There's love in my heart
There's love in my heart
Knowing you're mine
There's no way out
There's no way out of this mess
So darling may I
Help you get out of that dress
And we'll fall apart
And I'll piece us back together
We'll make it through
Oh, in the stormy weather
Cause roses are red
Roses are red most of the time
There's love in my heart
There's love in my heart
Knowing you're mine
There's no way out
There's no way out of this mess
So darling may I
Help you get out of that dress
You know, I always love
Truth be told, I'm so caught up
In everything about my life
The lights and cameras aren't my type
Oh, I know it's been a rush
But baby I just won't give up
Cause you don't know
Roses are red most of the time
There's love in my heart
There's a love in my heart
Knowing you're mine
There's no way out
There's no way out of this mess
So darling may I
So darling may I
So darling may I
Help you get out of that dress
