I go to loud places
To search for someone
To be quiet with
Who will take me home
You go to loud places
To find someone who
Will take you higher than...
I took you
Didn't I take you to...
Higher places you
Can't reach without me
(Reach without me)

I go to those places
Where we used to go
They seem so quiet now
I here all alone
You go to new places
With I don't know who
And I don't know how
To follow you
I take you higher
I'll take you higher
I'll take you to
Higher places you
Can't reach without me

(Reach without me)

(Indris Muhammed:)
I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights

I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such highs

Your on ecstacy
Without me
When you come down
I won't be around
