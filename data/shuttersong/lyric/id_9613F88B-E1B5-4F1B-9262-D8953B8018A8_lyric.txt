Jingle bell, jingle bell

jingle bell rock

jingle bell swing

and jingle bells ring

snowin' and blowin'

up bushels of fun

now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell

jingle bell rock

jingle bells chime in

jingle bell time

dancin' and prancin'

in jingle bell square

in the frosty air

What a bright time

it's the right time

to rock the night away

jingle bell, time

is a swell time

to go glidin' in a

one horse sleigh

Giddy-up, jingle horse

pick up your feet

jingle around the clock

mix and mingle

in a jinglin' beat

that's the jingle bell

that's the jingle bell

that's the jingle bell rock

Oh the weather outside is frightful

But the fire is so delightful

And since we've no place to go

Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping

And I've bought some corn for popping

The lights are turned way down low

Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

But if you'll really hold me tight

All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying

And, my dear, we're still goodbying

But as long as you love me so

Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

(Piero)

It's the most wonderful time of the year

With the kids jingle belling

And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer"

It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all

With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings

When friends come to call

It's the hap- happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting

Marshmallows for toasting

And caroling out in the snow

There'll be scary ghost stories

And tales of the glories of

Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the most wonderful time

It's the most wonderful time

Of the year!
