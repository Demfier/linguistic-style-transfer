Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should all acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

And surely you will buy your cup
And surely I'll buy mine
And we'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

We too have run around the slopes
And picked the daisies fine
We've wondered many weary foot
Since auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

For auld lang syne
We too have paddled in the stream
From morning sun to night
But the seas between us broad have roared

From auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld langs syne
