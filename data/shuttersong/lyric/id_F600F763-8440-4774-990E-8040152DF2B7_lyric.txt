I can't sleep tonight, wide awake and so confused
Everything's in line but I'm bruised
I need a voice to echo, I need a light to take me home
I kinda need a hero, is it you?
I never see the forest for the trees
I could really use your melody
Baby, I'm a little blind I think it's time for you to find me
Can you be my Nightingale?

Sing to me, I know you're there
You could be my sanity
Bring me peace, sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my Nightingale

Somebody speak to me please, ‘cause I'm feeling like hell
Need you to answer me, I'm overwhelmed
I need a voice to echo, I need a light to take me home
I need to star to follow, I don't know
I never see the forest for the trees

I could really use your melody
Baby, I'm a little blind I think it's time for you to find me
Can you be my Nightingale?
Sing to me, I know you're there
You could be my sanity
Bring me peace, sing me to sleep

Say you'll be my Nightingale
I don't know what I'd do without you
Your words are like a whisper coming through
As long as you're with me here tonight, I'm good

Can you be my Nightingale?
Feel so close, I know you're there
Ohhhh Nightingale
Sing to me, I know you're there
‘Cause baby, you're my sanity
You bring me peace, sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my Nightingale, oh
