I've tried to let it go
But these butterflies I can't ignore
Cause every time that I look at you

Know we're in a catch 22
We've been friends for so long but I
Need to tell you what's on my mind
I'm sick and tired of playing games
â€˜Cause I know that you feel the same

I Know you inside out, so I'm asking now
Take a chance on me
How much clearer can I be?

Hey, boy, what you gonna do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
I'm Gold, Gold
You, me, good as can be, want to be more than your company
So bet your money on me
I'm Gold, Gold

Do I really need to spell it out?
My heart skips when you're around
I got everything that you need
So come on baby get close to me
So confused that i'm not surprised
From greater bells, and rolled the dice
Know all your moves, dont know why I fall
Should put me out, but I want it all

I Know you inside out, so I'm asking now
Take a chance on me
How much clearer can I be?

Hey, boy, what you gonna do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
I'm Gold, Gold
You, me, good as can be, want to be more than your company
So bet your money on me
I'm Gold, Gold

Na ra ta la la
I'm Gold, Gold
Na ra ta la la
I'm Gold, Gold

Been to cool just to tell you straight out but by now I wish you figured it out I wish you figured it I wish you figured it I wish ya
You're not a fool you see what I'm about, so by now I think you figured it out I think you figured it out I think you figured it out I think ya!

Hey, boy, watcha gonna do
If you want me like I want you, then man up and make your move
I'm Gold, Gold
You, me, good as can be, want to be more than your company
So bet your money on me
I'm Gold, Gold
Na ra ta la la
I'm Gold, Gold
Na ra ta la la
I'm Gold, Gold
