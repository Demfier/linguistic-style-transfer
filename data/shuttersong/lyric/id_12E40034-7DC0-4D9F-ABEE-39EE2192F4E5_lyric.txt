I wanna write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song

I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You will have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

Oooh, everything I need I get from you, oooh
Oooh, and givin' back is all I wanna do, oooh

I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So anytime you think that your heart is gonna sink
You know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

Oooh, everything I need I get from you, oooh
Oooh, and givin' back is all I wanna do, oooh

Oooh, everything I need I get from you, oooh
Oooh, givin' back is all I wanna do, oooh

I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So anytime I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a song
