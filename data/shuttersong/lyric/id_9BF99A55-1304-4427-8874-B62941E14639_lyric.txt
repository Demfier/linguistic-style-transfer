I'm broken, do you hear me?
I'm blinded
'Cause you are everything I see

I'm dancing, alone
I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around

And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this

If I'm louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down
In my arms and rescue me?

'Cause we are the same
You saved me
But when you leave it's gone again

And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails I'm on my knees, praying

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

I've never had the words to say
But now I'm asking you to stay
For a little while inside my arms

And as you close your eyes tonight
I pray that you will see the light
That's shining from the stars above

And I say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
'Cause I can love you more than this
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this
