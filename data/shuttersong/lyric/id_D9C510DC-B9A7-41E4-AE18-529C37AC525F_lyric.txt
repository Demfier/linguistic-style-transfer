With a face from a movie scene
Or magazine you know what I mean
She's definitely got the style on you
She's definitely got the style on you
She's got two-tone everything
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones everything you
Moving but she just can't move
Because "she way out"
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like "she way out"
"She way out"
I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you "she way out"
She said "It's not about your body
It's just social implications are
Brought upon by this party
That we're sitting in"
And "I'd like to say you've changed
But you're always the same
I've got a feeling
That the marijuana's rotting your brain"
She's got two-tone everything - way too intelligent
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones everything
Boyfriend
Telling him "Find me cause I'll never find you"
Because "she way out"
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like "she way out"
"She way out"
I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you "she way out"
Because "she way out"
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like "she way out"
"She way out"
I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you "she way out"
The tension is overflowing with every Benson
She's throwing on the floor and in my mouth
She said "I'd love you to stay but that's simply insane -
I've got a feeling that my friends are gonna kick in your brain"
Because
"She way out"
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like "she way out"
"She way out"
I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you "she way out"
"She way out"
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like "she way out"
"She way out"
I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you "she way out"
