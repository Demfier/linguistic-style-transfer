I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say
Hmm, hmm
That's what people say
Hmm, hmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say
Hmm, hmm
That's what people say
Hmm, hmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see
Hmm, hmm
That's what they don't see
Hmm, hmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)

And that's what they don't know
Hmm, hmm
That's what they don't know
Hmm, hmm
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break

And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off
Shake It Off, I Shake It Off

I-I-I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off
I-I-I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off
I-I-I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you been getting down

And out about the liars, and the dirty dirty cheats of the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
