Up - Olly Murs
I drew a broken heart
Right on your window pane
Waited for your reply
Here in the pouring rain
Just breathe against the glass
Leave me some kind of sign
I know the hurt won't pass  yeah
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
I never meant to break your heart
Now I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
I'll do what it takes to make this fly
Oh  you gotta hold on
Hold on to what you are feeling
That feeling is the best thing
The best thing  alright
I'm gonna place my bet on us
I know this love is heading
In the same direction
That's up
You drew a question mark
But you know what I want
I wanna turn the card  yeah
Right back to where it was
So let's build the brigde  yeah
From your side to mine
I'll be the one to cross over
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
I never meant to break your heart
Now I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
I'll do what it takes to make this fly
Oh  you gotta hold on
Hold on to what you are feeling
That feeling is the best thing
The best thing  alright
I'm gonna place my bet on us
I know this love is heading
In the same direction
That's up
Girl  I know we can climb back to
Where we were there
Feeling here with my heart 
Put my heart in your head
Well  I hope and I pray
That you do understand
If you did all you have to say is
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
I'm waiting for ya
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
I never meant to break your heart
(Come on)
Now I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
Do what it takes to make this fly
Oh  you gotta hold on
Hold on to what you are feeling
That feeling is the best thing
The best thing  alright
I'm gonna place my bet on us
I know this love is heading
In the same direction
That's up
