Audio Adrenaline - Kings & Queens
 
Little hands  shoeless feet
Lonely eyes looking back at me
Will we leave behind the innocent too brief
On their own  on the run
When their lives have only begun
These could be our daughters and our sons
And just like a drum I can hear their hearts beating
I know my God won't let them be defeated
Every child has a dream to belong and be loved
 
Boys become kings  girls will be queens
Wrapped in Your majesty
When we love  when we love the least of these
Then they will be brave and free
Shout Your name in victory
When we love  when we love the least of these
When we love the least of these
 
Break our hearts once again
Help us to remember when
We were only children hoping for a friend
Won't you look around
These are the lives that the world has forgotten
Waiting for doors of our hearts and our homes to open
 
Boys become kings  girls will be queens
Wrapped in Your majesty
When we love  when we love the least of these
Then they will be brave and free
Shout Your name in victory
When we love  when we love the least of these
When we love the least of these
 
If not us  who will be like Jesus
To the least of these
If not us tell me who will be like Jesus
Like Jesus to the least of these
 
Boys become kings  girls will be queens
Wrapped in Your majesty
When we love  when we love the least of these
Then they will be brave and free  shout Your name in victory
We will love  we will love the least of these
We will love the least of these
We will love the least of these
We will love the least of these
We will love the least of these
We will love the least of these
