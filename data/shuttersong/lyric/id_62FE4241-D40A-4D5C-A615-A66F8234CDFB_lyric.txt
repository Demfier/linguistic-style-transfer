Where will I go now it's all over
Where will I be now all is said and done
Here comes the time, prepare for justice
Seems like my final journey has begun

Riding on the wind, there's only one place left to go
Take me to my afterlife, high up or down below

Heaven or Hell - where do we go when we are leaving
Heaven or Hell - whatever comes to set us free
Heaven or Hell - I've gone a long way and I see there's no wishing well
The choice is made, it's heaven or hell

I'm not the one who was expected
So I'll return and be from heaven sent
I'm gonna get myself elected
And now I wanna be the president - \
