I'm the man shorty, come put them bands on it
If I get my hands on it, I can't let go I promise
My momma know I love her, she gave a chance to me
All my fans love me, they wave their hands for me
She do a dance for me, took off her pants for me
I had to catch myself and get another glance of it
I keep it 100 if you keep it 100
Real recognize real, we might get through something
Shout out to LA, shout out to Inglewood
Up at Crenshaw 9th grade then I went to Inglewood
I love to rep my city, just hope you reppin' with me
On the block all day with the extras with me
I'm a made nigga, made something out of none
On the way, all the gangstas ask me where I'm from
I said \
