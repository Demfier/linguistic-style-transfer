Cambridge to Boston
Lives in a world she's lost in
Victim of compromise

He's staring at her Aberdeen heart
London eyes, Glasglow bones
She's a whistle in the catacombs, a paradox

He's in love with the statue in a marble block
He's in love with the girl that time forgot
She just shuts her ears
She's fallen too far
With salt in her scars
We'll let it taste her tears
She's fallen too far
The girl that time forgot

Wasted moments
Full of potential atonement
An angel in disguise
But he can see her Aberdeen heart
London eyes, Glasglow bones
She's a whistle in the catacombs
A paradox, oh

He's in love with the statue in a marble block
He's in love with the girl that time forgot
She just shuts her ears
She's fallen too far
With salt in her scars
We'll let it taste her tears
She's fallen too far
The girl that time forgot
(That time forgot)
The girl that time forgot
(That time forgot)
You let her go, catacombs
You let her go
You let her go, catacombs
You let her go

She just shuts her ears
She's fallen too far
With salt in her scars
We'll let it taste her tears
She's fallen too far
The girl that time forgot
