Saw you leanin' against
That old record machine.lol
band
Written on the marquee.

It's a full moon tonight
So we gettin' rowdy
Yeah, we gettin' rowdy
G-g-gettin' rowdy.

Feelin' like I'm a highschooler
Sippin on a warm wine cooler
Hot 'cause the party don't stop
I'm in a crop top like I'm
Workin' at Hooters.

We been keepin' it PG
But I wanna get a little frisky
Come, give me some of that yum
Like a lollipop, let me
Set you free.

C'mon, 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Now don't even try to deny
We're both goin' home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

Write our names on the wall
In the back of the bar.
Steal some bubblegum from
The corner Maxi-Mart.

Yeah, we laughin' like kids
Causin' trouble in the dark
Causin' trouble in the dark
Tr-tr-trouble in the dark.

Feelin' like a sabre-tooth tiger
Sipper on a warm Budweiser
Touch me and give me that rush
Better pack a toothbrush
Gonna pull an all-nighter.

We been keepin' it couture
But I wanna get it on vulture
Come, give me some of that yum
Like a lollipop, baby
Don't be scared.

C'mon, 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Now don't even try to deny
We're both goin' home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

(I don't wanna), go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around.
(I don't wanna), think about
What's gonna be after this
I just wanna live right now.
(I don't wanna), go to sleep

What's gonna be after this
I just wanna live right now.
