When I was young
The feeling was there
It is still there
Unweaving in me

As I recollect
Take me back to the stems of it
Through the eyes of the parents tongue
How I listened to them

So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while

Call out my name, when you call I'll be there
I'm always running, chasing flames on a dare
Come back gimme light, come on darling shine
Call out my name, when you call I'll be there

So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while

Time after time
I'll be around
This love tonight
It will be around for a while

If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
Let your inner mystic unravel tonight
Harder than diamonds, we cut up the sky
Running like a river white hot with desire

So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while

Time after time
I'll be around
This love tonight
It will be around for a while

Really need to say, ah
Are you saying things have changed my ways again
Really need to say
(Really need to say)

Girl I've prayed, ah
Prayed I'd meet someone like you someday
That's all I need to say
(That's all I need to say, that's all I need to say)

So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while

Time after time
I'll be around
This love tonight
It will be around for a while
