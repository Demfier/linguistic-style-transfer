Far way
Far away from where we were
Each of us were hiding
for so long

Far way
Far away under the stars
When I close my eyes
I see your smile

If now
My last chance to make it right
Stand all
Stay with me so we can see the light..

[Reff:]
If I told what I could not say
If I showed all and let you in
If I opened up my heart
And spoke my love for you.
Would you walk with me til the end
When well end up being more than friends
Well go hand in hand
Til you understand
Here I am

Far way
Far away from where we were
May be now its time
to open up

Far way
Far away under the stars
All it takes is saying
What we feel

If now
My last chance to make it right
Stand all
Stay with me so we can see the light..
Tell all
Stay with me it will be alright..

[Reff 2x]

Far way
Far away from where we were
Will we try and make it
Right this time.
