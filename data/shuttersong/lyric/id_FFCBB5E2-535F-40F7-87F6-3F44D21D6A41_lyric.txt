Let the heroes rest
Let the striving cease
I lay down my crown
Here at your feet

I will trust
Here in the mystery
I will trust
In you completely

Awake my soul to sing
With your breath in me
I will worship
You taught my feet to dance
Upon disappointment and I
I will worship

Let the weary rise
Let their eyes to see
Your love crushing every lie
Every doubt and fear

I will trust
Here in the mystery
I will trust
In you completely

Awake my soul to sing
With your breath in me
I will worship
You taught my feet to dance
Upon disappointment and I
I will worship

Hallelujah, hallelujah
You are making
All things new
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You are making
All things new
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You are making
All things new
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You are making
All things new

Awake my soul to sing
With your breath in me
I will worship
You taught my feet to dance
Upon disappointment and I
I will worship
And I, I will worship
