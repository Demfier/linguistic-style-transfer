Yeah we going in again this is that intrusion
Spending like we got them ends this is that conclusion
You should bring your friend again I find that shit amusing
Take a shot, you see it now you don't that's the illusion
Yeah im packing clubs best believe I'm on my caddy flow
I guess that its apparent even yo mom and yo daddy know
That's I put on that dope show show em just what Manson about
And they rooting for the kid that's because I'm branching out
Gotta keep it moving, sorry baby I dont like to wait
Im hungry and I'm driven can you please get me a license plate
Girl we fellin' it they killin' it I see them dead chicks
Got that money they stick to you yeah I guess that bread sticks
Nigga got a vision I don't think you see it well
Over when the fat lady sings it do you see Adele?
I am young and I am reckless plus im hung just like a necklace
Go against me and your screwed so Texas ahhh
I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world

Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take (give & take)
But since I came here, felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake (possible mistake)
And its not what it seems just a kid with a dream
I' ma do it till the day that I die, ahhh
Pour my bottles up cause we don't give a fuck
Get a drink and throw it in the sky, ahh
You can be mad but its fucked what you had
Cause I'm pumping and I'm taking your spot
I never gon' quite middle figures what they get
Let them know I give it all I got
I got' em quoting verses got em saying my god

Book them shows, the only gigs you got is on your iPod

You are often mad and you talking bout your swag
Only label that's behind you is a motherfucking tag
And I been grinding steady so when the time is in ready
Don't bring them funny verses I ain't talking bout Mazetti
I'm reaching for the throne cause I know that you can't stand me
And a nigga never idle and you looking like randy
Plan b, naa this my chance to be in a record books
They say what comes around goes around tell me how this record looks
Cause when it get 180 that's the day they gonna pay me
Cause I been paying these dues and its been driving me crazy
So lets just make a toast and lets just get a buzz
Saying hi to what we'll be, saying bye to what we was
And if im gonna make we'll see
But I guarantee that you should focus on me me
