We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
The lights and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up and switch sides like a record changer
The rumours, are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand
And please take me dancing
And please leave me stranded it's so romantic

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
