Beside You - 5 Seconds Of Summer\n Within a minute I was all packed up\n I've got a ticket to another world\n I don't wanna go\n I don't wanna go\n Sudden words are hard to speak\n When your thoughts are all I see\n "Don't ever leave " she said to me\n When we both fall asleep underneath the same sky \n To the beat of our hearts at the same time \n So close but so far away \n Can you hear me \n She sleeps alone \n My heart wants to come home \n I wish I was  I wish I was beside you \n She lies awake \n I'm trying to find the words to say \n I wish I was  I wish I was beside you \n Another day  and I'm somewhere new \n I made a promise that I'll come home soon \n Bring me back  bring me back to you \n When we both wake up underneath the same sun \n Time stops  I wish that I could rewind \n So close but so far away \n She sleeps alone \n My heart wants to come home \n I wish I was  I wish I was beside you \n She lies awake \n I'm trying to find the words to say \n I wish I was  I wish I was beside you \n The pieces of us both\n Under every city light\n And they're shining as we fade into the night\n She sleeps alone \n My heart wants to come home \n I wish I was  I wish I was \n She sleeps alone \n My heart wants to come home \n I wish I was  I wish I was beside you \n She lies awake \n I'm trying to find the words to say \n I wish I was  I wish I was beside you \n She lies awake \n Beside you \n I wish I was  I wish I was \n She sleeps alone \n My heart wants to come home \n I wish I was  I wish I was
