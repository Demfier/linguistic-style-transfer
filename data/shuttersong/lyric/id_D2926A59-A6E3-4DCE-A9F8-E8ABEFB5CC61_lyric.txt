In the midnight haze
We are sitting in the sun
The light hits your face
and i know that you're the one
We could fill the pages
with good dreams tonight
I wanna be a chapter in your book of love

In your boooooo book of love
In your boooooo book of love
In your booo booo
In your booo booo
In your boooooo book of love

Maybe we are flying
too close to the sun
And we may get burnt
but I'd be a crime to run
cuz you're perfect as the deep blue sky above
you can be a chapter in my book of love

In my boooooo book of love
In my boooooo book of love
In my boooooo booo
In my booo booo ooo
In my boooooo book of love

Eternity is our playground
Tell me if you wanna get high
Tell me if you wanna be down

In my boooooo book of love
In my boooooo book of love
In my booo booo
In my booo booo
In my boooooo book of love
In my...
In my...
In my book of love
