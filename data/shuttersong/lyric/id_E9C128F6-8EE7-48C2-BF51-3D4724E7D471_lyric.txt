You warned me that
You were gonna leave
Never thought you would really go
I was blind
But baby now I see
Broke your heart
But now I know

That I was being such a fool (fool)
And I didn't deserve you (oooh)

I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I don't know if I'll get up
And I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm dyin' without your love
Begging to hear your voice
Tell me you love me too
Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you

Looking at the letter that you left
— the letter that you left, will I ever get you back —
Wondering if I'll ever get you... back Dreaming about when I'll see you next
— When will I see you next, will I ever get you back —
Knowing that I never will forget
— I won't forget, I won't forget —

That I was being such a fool (fool)
And I still don't deserve you (ooh)

I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I don't know if I'll get up
And I don't wanna cause a scene
Cause I'm dyin' without your love
Yeah! Begging to hear your voice
Tell me you love me too
Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you

So tell me what we're fighting for
Cause you know that truth means so much more cause you would, if you could don't lie
Cause I give everything that I've got left
To show you I mean what I have said
I know I was such a fool
But I can't live without you

Don't wanna fall asleep
Don't know if I'll get up
I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm dyin' without your love
Begging to hear your voice
Tell me you love me too
Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you

Yeah!

Don't wanna fall asleep (don't wanna fall asleep)
Cause I don't know if I'll get up (who knows if I'll get up)
Don't wanna cause a scene
Cause I'm dyin' without your love
Yeah! Begging to hear your voice (let me hear your voice)
Tell me you love me too (tell me you love me too)
Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you
