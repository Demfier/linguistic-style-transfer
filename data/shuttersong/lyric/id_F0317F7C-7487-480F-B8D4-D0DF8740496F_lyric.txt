Fun - Pitbull Chris Brown
Chris Brown  you set it off
Oh  feeling crazy
The moon is up  the night is hazy
Let's get lost in the shadows
Somewhere we can go
And no one else can find
Lose 'em everybody till you come undone
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone
Lose 'em everybody till you come undone
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone
Oh my mind  looking like good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my mind 
Hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy 
I just wanna in tonight
F U N  fun

Miami  the LA  before we taking off
I'm a hard worker
I'm far from a boss
But when it set in done
I'm owing it oh

Just this  just that  haha
Right  now baby  this my life 
Wanna have fun  for night  dangerous
Lose 'em everybody till you come undone
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone
Lose 'em everybody till you come undone
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone

The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my mind 
Hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy 
I just wanna in tonight
