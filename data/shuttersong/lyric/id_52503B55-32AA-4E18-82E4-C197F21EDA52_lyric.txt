Come with me!
We've been decorating the tree!
This is what the season can be,
Our favorite time of year!

Look around!
Cookies coming in by the pound!
Hot cocoa to wash it all down,
And all our friends are here!

Wrap it up, stack it up,
Pack it up and go.
Hey, hey, whatcha say,
Step into the flow.
Love is what we got,
Smile on every face,
And presents all over the place!

We get to give 'em away!
We get to give 'em away-yay-yay-yeah!
Hey, hey, everyday!
We just wanna give 'em away!
Give 'em away!

Everyone, together we can
Get it all done!
We'll be having all kinds of fun,
And helping people too!

Everywhere (everywhere) you can feel the
Joy in the air (the joy in the air)!
Together we got so much to share
With love from me to you!
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

Wrap it up, stack it up,
Pack it up and go (pack it up and go).
Hey, hey, whatcha say,
Step into the flow (step into the flow).
Love is what we got,
Smile on every face,
And presents all over the place!

We get to give 'em away!
We get to give 'em away-yay-yay-yeah (give 'em away)!
Hey, hey, everyday!
We just wanna give 'em away!
We just wanna give 'em away!

Woah! Woah! Doesn't matter what you bring!
Woah! Woah! Could be just a little thing!
Woah! Woah! If you want the real thing,
This is what we say (come on, tell me whatcha say)!

Hey, hey, everyday!
We just wanna give 'em away (wrap it up, stack it up)!
