I can't believe that every day and every night

It's gettin' better if you're out of my life
It's like I flicked the switch and now I'm feeling good
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes, I know I feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means?
Well it's hot, it's loud, it's wild

We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight

We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Well it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that
