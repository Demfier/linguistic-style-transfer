When your soul finds the soul
It was waiting for
When someone walks into your heart
Through an open door
When your hand finds the hand
It was meant to hold
Don't let go

Someone comes into your world
Suddenly your world has changed forever

No, there's no one else's eyes
That can see into me
No one else's arms can lift
Lift me up so high
Your love lifts me out of time
And you know my heart by heart

When you're one with the one
You were meant to find
Everything falls in place
All the stars align
When you're touched by the cloud
That has touched your soul
Don't let go

Someone comes into your life
It's like they've been in your life forever

No, there's no one else's eyes
That can see into me
No one else's arms can lift
Lift me up so high
Your love lifts me out of time
And you know my heart by heart

So now we've found our way
To find each other
So now I found my way
To you

No, there's no one else's eyes
That can see into me

No, there's no one else's eyes
That can see into me
No one else's arms can lift
Lift me up so high
Your love lifts me out of time
And you know my heart by heart
And you know my heart by heart
And you know my heart by heart
And you know my heart by heart
