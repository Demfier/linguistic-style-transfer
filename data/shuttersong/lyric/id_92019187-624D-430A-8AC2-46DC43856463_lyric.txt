No where to hide.
Ohhh.
Give myself up this time.

Should I be afraid?
They know I'm watching.
I can't see a face.
I hear them calling.
What do you want from me?
I don't have much.
What do you want from me?
What is enough?
What do you want?
Ohhh.
Ohhh.
Am I alive?
Ohhh.
Can you see them in my sight?
Should I be afraid?
They know I'm watching.
I can't see a face.
I hear them calling.
What do you want form me?
I don't have much.
What do you want from me?
What is enough?
What do you want?
Ohhh.
Ohhh.
