Big Big World - Emilia Rydberg\n Written by：Emilia Rydberg/Lasse Anderson\n I'm a big big girl\n In a big big world\n It's not a big big thing\n If you leave me\n But I do do feel that\n I too too will miss you much\n Miss you much   \n I can see the first leaf falling\n It's all yellow and nice\n It's so very cold outside\n Like the way I'm feeling inside\n I'm a big big girl\n In a big big world\n It's not a big big thing\n If you leave me\n But I do do feel that\n I too too will\n Miss you much\n Miss you much   \n Outside it's now raining\n And tears are falling from my eyes\n Why did it have to happen\n Why did it all have to end\n I'm a big big girl\n In a big big world\n It's not a big big thing\n If you leave me\n But I do do feel\n That I too too will\n Miss you much\n Miss you much\n I have your arms around me\n Ooooh like fire\n But when I open my eyes\n You're gone   \n I'm a big big girl\n In a big big world\n It's not a big big thing\n If you leave me\n But I do do feel\n That I too too will\n Miss you much\n Miss you much   \n I'm a big big girl\n In a big big world\n It's not a big big thing\n If you leave me\n But I do feel I will\n Miss you much\n Miss you much
