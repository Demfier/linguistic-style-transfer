And you pick a place you just pick a place
Um Johnny
Yeah Gwenie Gwen Gwen
You might wanna hurry because tonight is the night
I'm empty, I need fulfillin' yes I do love
To the ceilin' when I do love

I'm restless, can't you see I try my bestest?
To be good girl because it's just us
So take me now and do me justice
I'm waiting patiently anticipating
Your arrival and I'm hating
It takes so long to get to my house to take me out
Tonight I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat

Bubble pop electric, uh-oh in the back seat

Swoop on by so you can snatch me and take me out
Tonight I'm gonna give you all my love in the back seat
