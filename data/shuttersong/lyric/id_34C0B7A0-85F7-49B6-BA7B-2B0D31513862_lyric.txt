"I'm In"

Days go by,
And you feel the heartbreak start to settle in like a dose of medicine
Yeah, you better believe my whole life
I've been waiting for somebody like you
Could hold me down and keep the ropes tied
No lie
I never thought the day would come where me and you would part ways
And even though we're in a hard phase
Can't forget, looking up at that sky when we would stargaze
Yeah, I'm so amazed by what we had and how it vanished in a blink of an eye
I was yours, you were mine
Unbelievable feelings would rush upon me everytime I would look at you
But really look at you
Late nights, me and you and nobody else
We're better together, as clich¨¦ as it sounds
Let me break it down
If we could start over it would mean the world to me
I'll make you happy as a girl could be

Give me a chance (one chance girl)
I need the soft touch of your skin
All I wanna hear is baby I'm in
Yeahh
Baby I'm in
Yeeaah
Oh baby I'm in
Woah
Baby I'm, in, yeah (yeah) yeah

You're the girl for me and I know that
You ain't gotta cut me no slack
Go step by step take it slow, yeah
I wanna make sure we get it right
We get it right (get it right)
This time

Okay, maybe I didn't give you enough attention
Maybe it was the girl that I was supposedly kissin'
Maybe it was because I wouldn't take you out to eat
And I would rather make you somethin' in the kitchen
I don't know
But whatever it is I'd rather talk it out than sit here and play these childish games
Speakin' of childish games
I'd go through chutes and ladders or to the end of a maze
To go back to the days when I was all that you crave
Together we laid, a couple kids who together made up a couple unphased
By anything or anyone in their way
It's your choice if you leave or if you stay
Damn
I know you miss it too
And you know that I'm missin' you
And as long as the skies are blue, I'm right here (so)

Give me a chance (one chance girl)
I need the soft touch of your skin
All I wanna hear is baby I'm in
Yeahh
Baby I'm in
Yeeaah
Oh baby I'm in
Woah
Baby I'm, in, yeah (yeah) yeah

You're the girl for me and I know that
You ain't gotta cut me no slack
Go step by step take it slow, yeah
I wanna make sure we get it right
We get it right (get it right)
This time

Baby I'm in
Baby I'm in
Come on, baby
Come on, yeah yeaahh

All I wanna hear is baby I'm in
Yeahh
Baby I'm in
Yeeaah
Oh baby I'm in
Woah
Baby I'm, in, yeah (yeah) yeah

You're the girl for me and I know that
You ain't gotta cut me no slack
Go step by step take it slow, yeah
I wanna make sure we get it right
We get it right (get it right)
This time
