We all fall down
But we get back up again, get back up again
If it all runs out
That's were love- it just begins
Yeah
No better time than now
Let's all go out
Leave the drama, bring your friends
When's the last time you said yes?
Put the cell on silence,
drop all the stress
No texting, no check-in
Status changed, look around
Take a breathe in
Haha
When's the last time you had a laugh?
Enjoyed the present, looked your past
All the struggling, all the hustling
If we put eachother first we can love again
Cause if you try, you can learn to win
And if you let go you can finally live
It's just a state of mind
Cause once you fly, you won't be scared to swim
Don't let nobody bring you down
Trouble your troubles and doubt your doubts
Hands in the air and sing it loud
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Trouble your troubles and doubt your doubts
Hands in the air and sing it loud
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When's the last time you said no?
You had a couple worries and you let it show
You had a few bumps in the road
You couldn't crack the code
Well that's okay, let it go
Cause if it's meant to be, it will come true
You don't need to run if you want to
Even if you cry
You can smile about every little thing that makes you, you
You're beautiful
Remember to be happy once and again
Cause even if you lose you can call a friend
Yeah in this life we get to choose where we go
But sometimes we don't really know
So we
Cause if you try, you can learn to win
If you let go you can finally live
It's just a state of mind
Cause once you fly, you won't be scared to swim
Don't let nobody bring you down
Trouble your troubles and doubt your doubts
Hands in the air and sing it loud
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Trouble your troubles and doubt your doubts
Hands in the air and sing it loud
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ha ha ha
Just let it all go
You know
It's like drinking milk out of a wine glass
Remind yourself it's okay not to be perfect
You're one of a kind
Love, is an open door
Go and jump through it
I thought I told you I was a professional singer in the car
So if you ride with me let me hear you sing
Trouble your troubles and doubt your doubts
Hands in the air and sing it loud
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Trouble your troubles and doubt your doubts
Hands in the air and sing it loud
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
