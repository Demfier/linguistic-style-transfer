(Dizzee Rascal)
Yo if that girl know's where you stay thats poor
some whore bangin on your door what for
pregnant? what're you talkin about this for
fifteen, she's under age thats raw
and against law 5 years or more
and she wants a score and half of a draw
thats a kind of friend that you try and ignore
that whore got you pinned down to the floor
but its your own fault you said three magic words (i love you)
when thats the one for the birds
when you said that she forgot other boys
its over you better start buyin the toys
there was no intention of hurtin your wife
now she knows this she's endin your life
its a real shame you got hacked by the whores
its a shame that kid probably aint yours

(Chorus - Dizzee & Girl)
(Dizzee Rascal)
That girl some bitch ya know
she keep callin my phone
she dont leave me alone
she just moan and groan
she just keep ringin me at home
these days I dont answer my phone

leap low dizzee rascal deep roll
big feet for the force with my big toe
I got no chaps, no chains, not much doe
get juiced but you dont get love though

jambo comin through like rambo
love ting takes two like tango
but she aint my wifey she can go

listen, I like your girl so you better look after your girl
or I might just take your girl and make your girl my girl
switch your girl with michelle
switch michelle with chantelle
play chantelle with shennele
lyrical clientelle but I aint a bow cat, I dont like the smell
i'm gonna go through a shell and make a boy feel unwell

that girl from school, that girl's from college
that girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge
that girl gives head, that girl gives shines
that girl gives bj's at all times
she looks decent, she looks fine
but dont talk about wifey she's not mine
she got battried, 6 in a line, believe me thats not a good sign

(Chorus - Dizzee & Girl)
