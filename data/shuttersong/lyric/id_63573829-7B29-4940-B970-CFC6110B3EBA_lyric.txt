Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride
And greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair
As the dining room proudly presents
Your dinner!
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
(That's right)

Hot hors d'oeurvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff
It's delicious
Don't believe me? Ask the dishes
They can sing sing sing
they can dance dance dance
After all, Miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never never second best
come on
Go on, unfold your menu
Go on, take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
