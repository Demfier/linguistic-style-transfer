Lady in a glass dress

I can see right through you

You act like you don't want this

But you know that you do

Since he broke your heart, girl

You say that you won't love again

And you won't let his type girl

But we know in the end

You still dream

You still dream

Baby, I can make your dreams come true

Oh, oh

Lady in the glass dress

Oh, oh
