Every point of view has another angle
And every angle has its merit
But it all comes down to faith

That's the way I see it

You can say that love is not divine
And you can say that life is not eternal
"All we have is now"
But I don't believe it

There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And the restless soul is searching
There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And it's a void only He can fill

Does the world seem gray with empty longing
Wearing every shade of cynical
And do you ever feel that
There is something missing?

There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And the restless soul is searching
There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And it's a void only He can fill, that's my point of view

There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And the restless soul is searching
There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And it's a void

There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And the restless soul is searching
There's a God-shaped hole in all of us
And it's a void only He can fill, only He can fill

That's my point of view
That's my point of view
And that's my point of view
Now that's my point of view

That's my point of view
Now that's my point of view
Now that's my point of view
Now that's my point of view
