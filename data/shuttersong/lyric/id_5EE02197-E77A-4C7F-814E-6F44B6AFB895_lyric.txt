The Script - "If You Could See Me Now"\n  \n Oh  if you could see me now\n Oh  if you could see me now\n  \n It was February 14th  Valentines Day\n The roses came  but they took you away\n Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm\n All the harm  gotta keep myself calm\n But the truth is you're gone\n And I'll never get to show you these songs\n Dad  you should see the tours that I'm on\n I see you standing there next to mom\n Both singing along  yeah arm in arm\n There are days when I'm losing my faith\n Because the man wasn't good - he was great \n He'd say  "Music was the home for your pain"\n And explain I was young  he would say\n "Take that rage  put it on a page \n Take the page to the stage  blow the roof off the place "\n I'm tryin' to make you proud  do everything you did\n I hope you're up there with God sayin' "That's my kid"\n  \n I still look for your face in the crowd\n Oh  if you could see me now\n Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow\n Oh  if you could see me now\n  \n Oh  if you could see me now\n Yeah\n  \n If you could see me know would you recognize me\n Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me \n Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face\n Put your hand on the heart that was cold as the day you were taken away\n I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day\n Right now  I wish he could hear you say \n I drink too much and I smoke too much Dutch\n But if you can't see me now that sh*t's a must \n He used to say I won't know ( ) 'til it cost me\n Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it\n So if you've lost a sister  someone's lost a mom\n And if you've lost a dad  then someone's lost a son\n And they're all missing now  and they're all missing now\n So if you get a second to look down at me now\n Mom  dad  I'm just missin' you now\n  \n I still look for your face in the crowd\n Oh  if you could see me now\n Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow\n Oh  if you could see me now\n Oh\n  \n Would you call me a saint or a sinner \n Would you love me  loser or winner \n Oh\n  \n When I see my face in the mirror\n We look so alike that it makes me shiver\n Oh\n  \n I still look for your face in the crowd\n Oh  if you could see me now\n Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow\n Oh  if you could see me now\n  \n I still look for your face in the crowd\n Oh  if you could see me now\n Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow\n Oh  if you could see me now\n Oh  if you could see  you could see me now   \n  \n //
