The Power - Snap!
I've got the power
I've got the power
Hey yeah hey
Like the crack of the whip I snap attack
Front to back in this thing called rap
Dig it like a shovel rhyme devil on a Heavenly level
Bang the bass turn up the treble
Radical mind day and night all the time
Seven fourteen wise divine
Maniac brainiac winning the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James
Quality I possess and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the mic-rophone that I am holding
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
If they all snap don't need the police
To try to save them your voice don't see
So peace stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting it's getting it's getting kinda hectic
Quality I possess and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the mic-rophone that I am holding
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice don't see
So peace stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
