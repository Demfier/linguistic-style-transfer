For now you can stay
Right here we will play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly different frame of mind
Right here in my arms
Away from all harm
You'll be safe from all the flares
Although I know you don't care

Ohh...

You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
With your shattered frame of mind
Withstand, you can always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better frame of mind

When they say you will fall
You can reach nothing at all
Hide your tracks, beneath the line
Of a different frame of mind
Is it that what you've heard
Broken words in the dirt
Yelling out into the sun

Here we come
Here we come
Ohh...
Here we come
Here we come
Ohh...
Here we come
Here we come

You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
With your shattered frame of mind
Withstand, you can always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better frame of mind

You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
With your shattered frame of mind
Withstand, you can always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better frame of mind

And when daylight comes through
When the day is anew
Then it will be time
For a new frame of mind
When all eyes are on you
You will know what to do
Since you would have found
Your new frame of mind

When you lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath and give it time.
You can walk the path among the lines
But always know that you'll be safe
I'll be here throughout your days
Come, find me and we will play
