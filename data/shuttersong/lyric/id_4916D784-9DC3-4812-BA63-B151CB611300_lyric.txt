When I was just a little girl, my momma used to tuck me into bed
She read me a story
It always was about a Princess in distress and how a guy would save her
End up with the glory

I'd lie in bed and think about the person that I wanted to be
Then one day I realized the fairy tale life wasn't for me

I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting for a handsome prince to come and save me on a horse of white
Unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no-one else
I'd rather rescue myself
Someday, I'm gonna find someone who wants my soul, heart and mind

Who's not afraid to show that he loves me
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am
Don't need nobody taking care of me
I will be there for him just as strong as he, will be there for me

When I give myself then it has got to be, an equal thing
I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free

I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting for a handsome prince to come and save me on a horse of white
Unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no-one else
I'd rather rescue myself
I can slay, my own dragon
I can dream, my own dreams
My knight in shining armour is me
So, I'm gonna set me free

Like Cinderella
Old dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting for a handsome prince to come and save me

I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting for a handsome prince to come and save me on a horse of white
Unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no-one else
I'd rather rescue myself
I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting for a handsome prince to come and save me on a horse of white
Unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no-one else
I'd rather rescue myself
