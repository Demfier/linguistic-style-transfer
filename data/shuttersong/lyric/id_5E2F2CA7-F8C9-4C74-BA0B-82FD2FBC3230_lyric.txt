sing me to sleep
i'm tired and i
i want to go to bed
sing me to sleep

and then leave me alone
don't try to wake me in the morning
'cause i will be gone
don't feel bad for me
i want you to know
deep in the cell of my heart
i will feel so glad to go
sing me to sleep
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore

sing to me
i don't want to wake up on my own anymore
don't feel bad for me
i want you to know

deep in the cell of my heart
i really want to go
there is another world
there is a better world
well, there must be
well...
bye bye
bye...
