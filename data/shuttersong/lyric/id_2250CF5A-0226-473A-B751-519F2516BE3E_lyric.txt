I heard the news today;
That you're not mine to keep.
Don't struggle too much now
While I kill you in your sleep.

What is lust if it's not being by yourself?
I won't be gentle to the body on the shelf

It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love

It's only slaughter
We're only liars
It's only blood

They're only thoughts that I'm having;
Thoughts safe within my head.
You're only crying
You're only dying
You're only red.

I heard the news today,
That you weren't mine to save
I hope that you're comfortable
In the quiet lasting grave

What is lust if it's not being by yourself?
I won't be gentle to the body on the shelf.

It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love

It's only slaughter
We're only liars
It's only blood

They're only thoughts that I'm having;
Thoughts safe within my head.
You're only crying
You're only dying
You're only dead

It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love

It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love

It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only slaughter
We're only liars
It's only blood
They're only thoughts that I'm having;
Thoughts safe within my head.
You're only crying
You're only dying
You're only dead
