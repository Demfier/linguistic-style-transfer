Hey kids do you wanna do what I do?
I got sick got kicked outta high school
I guess then I kinda got arrested
With a car and a chase and a drug test
These days they don't wanna be near that
'Cause if you're selling records
They don't wanna hear that
Clean-cut, we'll do it like Disney
Well-adjusted, trusted, trust me
Party anthems get them dancing
Well I'm the king of second chancin'
Air-brushed, shiny, notoriety
They disappeared into the back to go and get high-ity
Hey, Oh
Where did all the good go?
Baby this is where you're dead wrong
Alright
Hey, Oh
Here's to all the zeros
And every misfit
And all my down-and-ups
Hey, Oh
Where did all the good go?
Baby this is where you're dead wrong
Alright
Hey, Oh
Here's to all the zeros
And every misfit
And all my down-and-ups
You don't sing, you got a young look so
It's nothing auto-tune can't fix though
MTV don't play videos
And no guitar is allowed on the radio
These days I kinda just pretend so
I guess I don't mind, it depends though
I get stuck to every innuendo
But it doesn't seem to matter in the end so
They say where's the next hit baby
God how could I top Call Me Maybe?
Well I'm delirious she's bicurious
Let's disappear into the back to go and get serious
Hey, Oh
Where did all the good go?
Baby this is where you're dead wrong
Alright
Hey, Oh
Here's to all the zeros
And every misfit
And all my down-and-ups
Hey, Oh
Where did all the good go?
Baby this is where you're dead wrong
Alright
Hey, Oh
Here's to all the zeros
And every misfit
And all my down-and-ups
Oh-oh
Hallelujah up for ransom
Cash value for hashtag anthems
Say it now
Hallelujah up for ransom (woah)
Cash value for hashtag anthems (hoo)
Hallelujah up for ransom (sing hallelujah)
Cash value for hashtag anthems (hallelujah yeah)
Hallelujah up for ransom (eh, oh, where did all the good go?)
Cash value for hashtag anthems (eh, oh, where'd the rock and roll go?)
Hey, Oh
Where did all the good go?
Baby this is where you're dead wrong
Alright
Hey, Oh
Here's to all the zeros
And every misfit
And all my down-and-ups
