All that i did was walk over
Start off by shaking your hands
That's how it wents
I had a smile on my face and i sat up straight
Oh yeah yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
No i just don't understand why
You won't talk to me
It hurts that i'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
Oh yeah yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me
I tried to belong
It didn't seem wrong
My headaches
It's been so long
I'll write this song
If that's what it take
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Take me go away
