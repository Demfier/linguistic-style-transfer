Counting down the seconds
Jumping off these fences
Finding another place to start again

Cracks in the sidewalk
I'm over all the small talk
Taking off like fire in the wind

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Running and we're not looking back

I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
Fly away tonight

I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
Fly away, fly away tonight

Fly away tonight

A never ending replay
Memories I can't erase
I see the best of times in front of me

Now I'm off to paradise
Swore I'll never fight
Say goodbye to pain and misery

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Running and we're not looking back

I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
Fly away tonight

I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
Fly away, fly away tonight

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away

Counting down the seconds
Only second guessing
Dreaming of a place to start again

I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
Fly away tonight

I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
Fly away, fly away tonight

Fly away tonight
