It's my last big breath, what you want me to do?
When you act all cool like you already knew
That I'll be stuck here cold just waiting it through
'Til your heart starts beating for that somebody new
You know that it's true

'Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right out of my heart

And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
'Cause nobody else could be
Nearly as cruel as you

It's a wicked game that you're making me play
(making me play)
Where I crawl back home as you're walking away
(Hey, hey)

And it's all quite clear what you want me to say
(What you want me to say)
But you'll be so long gone if I ask you to stay
You know that it's true

'Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right out of my heart

And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
'Cause nobody else could be
Nearly as cruel as you, cruel as you
(Hey, yeah)

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

It's my last big breath, what you want me to do?
When you act all cool like you already knew

'Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right out of my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
'Cause nobody else could be
Nearly as cruel as you
Hmm, nobody else could be
Nearly as cruel as you
As you
