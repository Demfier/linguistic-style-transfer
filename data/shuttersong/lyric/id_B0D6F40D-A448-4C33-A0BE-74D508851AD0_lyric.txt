Who's more desperate?
You're on your knees boo
But when you fuck up
I dont leave you
I cant leave you
Guess youre permanent
Cant be removed
Each time my heart breaks
Its like a new tattoo
Dont need a new tattoo
One touch always makes me
Too hard to escape
Three strikes
Im still yours, what am I waiting for?

I'm running out of room
For your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me
So don't tell me its cool
That Im tattoo
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me

Yeah, yeah

Why do we stay
When only fools would
I guess were both fools
Cause the sex is good
It's way too good
Call us crazy, misunderstood
Cause I cant leave you
I know I should
People say I should
The one touch always makes me
Too hard to escape

Three strikes
Im still yours, what am I waiting for?

Im running out of room
For your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me
So dont tell me its cool
That Im tattoo

How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me
Yeah, yeah

Permanently trying to hide
The scars we can't remove
You're drawn on me and I'm still drawn to you

Im running out of room
For your tattoos
How can I get over you (over you)
When you're all over me
So dont tell me its cool
That Im tattoo (tattoo)
How can I get over you (over you)
When you're all over me
Yeah, yeah
