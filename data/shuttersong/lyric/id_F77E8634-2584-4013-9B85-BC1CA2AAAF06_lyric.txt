They all say it
All the ones that made it
Once you find the one you claim it
But you're gonna have to fight

When I think back
Things that threw us off track
We handled like a heart attack
Cause we didn't see the light

Oooooooo, the end now

We both, know our
Own limitations, that's why we're strong
Now that we spend some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark
Cause we both know

From this moment
Forget what we were scared of
Say we're never giving up
You say you'll always
Try to be my
Helpin hand
Try to be the one who understands
When things don't go as you planned
We're still worth it all

Oooooooo, the end now...

We both, know our
Own limitations, that's why we're strong
Now that we spend some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark
Cause we both know

What we're scared of (What we're scared of)
What dreams are made of (What dreams are made of)
They can take us further than what anybody can see and
We both, know our
Own limitations, that's why we're strong

Now that we spend some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark
We both, know our
Own limitations, that's why we're strong
Now that we spend some time apart
We're leading each other, out of the dark
Cause we both know
We both know.
