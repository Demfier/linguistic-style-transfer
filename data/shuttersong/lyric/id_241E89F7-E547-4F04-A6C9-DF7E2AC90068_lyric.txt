Sorry I don't treat you like a goddess is that what you want me to do?
Sorry I don't treat you like you're perfect like all your little loyal servants do
Sorry I'm not made of sugar and I'm not sweet enough for you
Is that why you always avoid me That must be such an inconvenience to you
Well, I'm just your problem
I'm just your problem
It's like I'm not even a person am I
I'm just your problem
Well I shouldn't have to justify what I do and
I shouldn't have to prove anything to
you
I'm sorry that I exist forget what landed me on the blacklist
And I shouldn't have to be the one that makes up with you
So why do I want to
Why do I want to
Why do I want to
Why do I want to
