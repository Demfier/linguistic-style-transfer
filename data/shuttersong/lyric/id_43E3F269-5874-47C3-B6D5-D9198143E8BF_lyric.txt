I will not relent, no, no
Never live with defeat, never falter.
This like the air that I breathe, (Like the air that I breathe)
I will not choke on failure.

I will not choke on failure.

I am a mortal man, but I'm
Not falling I'm not broken yet.
I am a mortal man, but I'll
Hold tight to my beliefs now.

I have suffered defeat, pain, loss
Still I push to the edge, never falter.
For this cements my beliefs, (This cements my beliefs)
I'll remain my own master.

I will not relent, no, no
Never suffer defeat, never falter
For this cements my beliefs, (This cements my beliefs)
I will not choke on failure.

I am a mortal man, but I'm
Not falling I'm not broken yet.
I am a mortal man, but I'll
Hold tight to my beliefs now

I am a mortal man, but I'm
Not falling I'm not broken yet.
I am a mortal man, but I'll
Hold tight to my beliefs now.

I will not relent
I will not relent, no, no.
I will not relent
Never suffer defeat, never falter.
I will not relent, no, no
Never suffer, never falter.
I will not relent, no, no
Never suffer, never falter
