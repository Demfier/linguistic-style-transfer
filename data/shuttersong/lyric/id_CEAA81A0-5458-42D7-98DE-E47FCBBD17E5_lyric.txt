Meglio stasera, baby, go, go, go

Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"

If you're ever gonna kiss me

It had better be tonight

While the mandolins are playing

And stars are bright

If you've anything to tell me

It had better be tonight

Or somebody else may tell me

And whisper the words just right

Meglio stasera, baby, go, go, go

Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"

If you're ever gonna hold me

It had better be tonight

Or somebody else may hold me

And they might make me feel just right

Meglio stasera, baby, go, go, go

Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"

For this poor

AmericanoWho knows little of your speech

Be a nice

ItalianoAnd start to teach

Show me how in old

MilanoLovers hold each other, oh so tight

But I warn you, sweet paesano

But it had better be tonight

Meglio stasera, baby, go, go, go

Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"
