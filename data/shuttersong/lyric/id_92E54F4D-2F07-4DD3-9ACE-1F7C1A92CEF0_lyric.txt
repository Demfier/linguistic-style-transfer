It's the most beautiful time of the year

Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer

I should be playing in the winter snow

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

I don't wanna miss out on the holiday

But I can't stop staring at your face

I should be playing in the winter snow

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you' shawty with you

With you' shawty with you

With you' under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire

Chestnuts roasting like a hot July

I should be chillin with my folks I know

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

Word on the street santa's coming at night

Reindeer's flying in the sky so high

I should be making a list i know

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you,shawty with you

With you,shawty with you

With you,under the mistletoe

With you,shawty with you

With you,shawty with you
和你一起，宝贝，和你一起
With you,under the mistletoe

Aye love' the wiseman followed a star

The way I follow my heart

And it lead me to a mirical

Aye love' dont you buy me nothin

Cause I am feelin one thing

your lips on my lips

That's a merry merry Christmas

It's the most beautiful time of the year

Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer

I should be playing in the winter snow

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

I don't wanna miss out on the holiday

But I can't stop staring at your face

I should be playing in the winter snow

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you' shawty with you

With you' shawty with you

With you' under the mistletoe

With you' shawty with you

With you' shawty with you

With you' under the mistletoe

Kiss me underneath the mistletoe

Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
