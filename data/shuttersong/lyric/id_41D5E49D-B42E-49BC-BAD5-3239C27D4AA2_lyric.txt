Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Fast lives are stuck in the undertoe
But you know the places I wanna go

'Cause oh oh oh

I've got a sickness
You've got the cure
You've got the spark I've been lookin' for
And I've got a plan we walk out the door
No you wanna just let go
It's time to roll down the windows

Sing it oh oh
Yeah all we need

So here we go

Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight

You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up
Turn it up
Alright
At five minutes to midnight

You see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop
And come alive
We could pack up
And leave all our things behind

No fact, or fiction, or storyline

'Cause I need you more than just for tonight
You're oh oh all I care
I can't stop my breathing
I'm weak and you were my medicine

I won't stop till I am under your skin

No you wanna just let go
It's time to roll down the windows
Sing it oh oh
Yeah all we need

So here we go
Turn it up

It's five minutes to midnight

You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up

Turn it up
Alright
At five minutes to midnight
You see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop

Make your heart drop
And come alive
And when the clock strikes twelve
Will you find another party
Go and kiss and tell
'Cause you know I never will

I think we should strike a match
We'll hold it to the wind to
See how long it lasts
We can make the time stand still

Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up
Turn it up
Alright
At five minutes to midnight
You see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop
And come alive
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up
Turn it up
Alright
At five minutes to midnight
You see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop
And come alive
