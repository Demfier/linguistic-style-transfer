You got a cousin who's tellin' you somethin'
That doesn't have nothin' with the love we're in, baby
I hear she's sayin' this game we're playin' should be complicated
If you won't, I'll say it, I think she's crazy 'cause

Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock down, drag outs, cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now, mama, don't you think?
We're having such a good time together, and it's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, loving you is fun
It's fun

I'm walking around all over this town, ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you, baby, I love it
There's no self help book on your shelf, you know too well
They're selling you somethin' for nothin' 'cause

Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock down, drag outs, cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now, mama, don't you think?
We're having such a good time together, and it's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, loving you is fun

This ol' heart's never smiled so hard, lovin' you is fun
Yeah, it's fun

Lovin' you is fun
