We could sit and be stubborn
Your face is so stern
We're just laughing, dance off the dirt
Darling it's worth it
We could be beautiful
The kind of love people beg for
'Cuz I've waited all my life
And now I've found you
Ooooh, why waste any more time?
Ooooh, tonight I've made up my mi-i-ind
So some day we'll dress up
Pure intentions for behind us
'Cuz loving you tonight
Means I'm ready for adventure
So girl listen closely
As we turn towards the crowd
And wave hello
We're Mr. and Mrs. Beautiful
So sit back and relax boy
'Cuz after tonight, baby you're all mine
And we've waited all our lives
To sing our hearts together
With you by my side I'm ready
Come on dear, can't you hear me singing
Here's my heart, please be true whoa-o-oa
So some day we'll dress up
Pure intentions for behind us
'Cuz loving you tonight
Means I'm ready for adventure
So girl listen closely
As we turn towards the crowd
And wave hello
We're Mr. and Mrs. Beautiful
Oh-oh Why waste any more time
Oh, with a simple kiss forever you're mine
So some day we'll dress up
Pure intentions for behind us
'Cuz loving you tonight
Means I'm ready for adventure
So girl listen closely
As we turn towards the crowd
And wave hello
We're Mr. and Mrs. Beautiful
