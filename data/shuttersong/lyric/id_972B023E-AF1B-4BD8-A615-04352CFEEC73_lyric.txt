You know, you know
You know, you know

You know how it goes
When you fall for the wrong one
I love you, I hate you
It ain't cool, it's fucked up
Crazy how two people fall in love with each other
Just to turn around and hurt one another
It's fucked up
You know how it goes
When you fall for the wrong one

You may have been the wrong one, but we met at the right time
Late night dinner date, sipping white wine
After hours, downtown like we fight crime
When you with someone around the clock, might find
That you learn to depend on each other
Then get sick of each other
Man, I miss how we used to be when we were so damn into each other
Every day I discover, something new about you
I put no one above you, you would ask "round two?"
Laying down in the covers
Body to body we sweating like the middle of the summer
Shit, I think I might love her
And the butterflies, they don't lie, but you sure do
Girl that's why, I'm internally conflicted deep inside
Looking for the right one, always coming up dry

When you fall for the wrong one
¡ª Jack & Jack

So I ask myself, why are the girls that I break with the same ones that I seem to fuck with the most? (damn)
Emotions are drained, the passion, the pain, ain't got any more love to devote (nah)
I wish we could travel the world, London to Spain, Dubai, I heard Dublin is dope
You push me away then you pull me in close
You love me, you hate me, I just wanna know (just wanna know)

I just wanna know
How could you do me like that?
I just wanna know
I thought you knew me better
I just wanna know
Than to do me like that
Like that, like that

Cause you know how it goes
When you fall for the wrong one
I love you, I hate you
It ain't cool, it's fucked up
Crazy how two people fall in love with each other
Just to turn around and hurt one another
It's fucked up
You know how it goes
When you fall for the wrong one

Backstabbing was a daily habit
Girl, ain't it tragic how we thought we had it
All figured out, I guess time outlasted
Our will to love, these unburied hatchets are all we have
I can't imagine, that the world's gonna stop spinning on it's axis
And wait for us to catch up, this whole situation's messed up
My heart's honor broken, you just kept tugging back
Back and forth hoping I wouldn't get fed up, I got fed up
Straight up, with the accusations, I'm aching for my next puff
Cause damn, you got a young kid stressed out
Friend's telling me you're getting around whenever I'm out of town
I can't seem to express how
That put a pit in my stomach, when I gave you my trust
Holding it down, saying

I did not know what to expect
Loving you felt better than these checks
Ow, yeah, and I didn't wanna hurt you
But this other girl's kissing on my neck
And she's fine, yeah, she's fine
I don't mind, I just might find the time
Cause I know you just put you there last week
Did you really think you could slip that shit past me?
No way

Cause you know how it goes
When you fall for the wrong one
I love you, I hate you
It ain't cool, it's fucked up
