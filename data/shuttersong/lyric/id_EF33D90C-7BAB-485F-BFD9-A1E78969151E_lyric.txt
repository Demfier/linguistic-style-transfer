I hope you know he's the wrong one
I hope you know he's the last one fighting for ya
I hope you know that he's dead wrong
I hope you see that in time you question
Every tear that you spare to really worth trying for
Really worth trying for
And all the pain that you bear to really worth fighting for
Really worth fighting for
Cos he got you falling so much deeper
Running the thought that come between ya
And I just see your fire fading
I hope you don't mind what I'm saying
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest
Let me be honest
Mmmmm
Just being honest
Yeah you deserve someone that's honest
Yeah you deserve someone that's honest
I hope you find out what's been missing
I hope you get the chance to find yourself again
I hope you find the strength to live in hope
I hope you see that on time you question
Every tear that you spare to really worth trying for
Really worth trying for
And all the pain that you bear to really worth fighting for
Really worth fighting for
Cos he got you falling so much deeper running the thoughts that come between ya
And I just see your fire fading
I hope you don't mind what I'm saying
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest
Let me be honest
Mmmmm
Just being honest
Yeah you deserve someone that's honest
