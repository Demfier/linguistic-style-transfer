How do I make the phone ring
Why do I even care
How are you all around me
When you're not really there
When you're not really there
How do I feel you on me when you're not on my skin
Why do you say you want me
Then tell me I'm not coming in
Baby just come on in
Cause every time I'm with you I go into my zone
And I'll remember all the places you wanna go
Take me on a ride
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
Cause every time I see you I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient so let's pick up the pace
Take me on a ride
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
How do you know I'm breathing when I'm holding my breath
Why don't we face the danger just for the night and forget
Baby let's just forget
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love
Baby let's fall in love
Cause every time I'm with you I go into my zone
And I'll remember all the places you wanna go
Take me on a ride
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
Cause every time I see you I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient so let's pick up the pace
Take me on a ride
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
Ain't nobody gonna touch it
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love
Baby let's be in love
Cause every time I'm with you I go into my zone
And I'll remember all the places you wanna go
Take me on a ride
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
Cause every time I see you I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient so let's pick up the pace
Take me on a ride
Ain't nobody gonna touch it touch it touch it
