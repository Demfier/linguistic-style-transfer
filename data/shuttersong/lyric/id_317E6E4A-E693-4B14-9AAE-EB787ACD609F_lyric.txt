"Tides"

Ya know
Alright, let's go

When the tide hits you straight in the face
Life is getting harder treading water, got nowhere to go
And as the time slips away, day by day
Stranded in the ocean, every open door has now been closed

Deadbolt locked, no escape
Feeling like an outcast, so out of place
And I know the tides might take you away
But don't you worry there's no hurry for tomorrow
'Cause today's still young

Now you've hit rock bottom and you're feeling lost at sea, yeah
Just keep your head above the water
And I know you'll find some way to breathe
When the tides they drag you down
When the tides they drag you down
Down under, further than you've ever been,
What I know
When the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out
Out so far, Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim

Whoa oh oh [3x]
Stay away from the bad tides
Whoa oh oh [3x] Yeah
Only go where there's good vibes

The good vibes, I knew I would choose positivity
After I realize my life is so much more
I know this life ain't what you bargained for
But honestly you never know what
Life has got in store (Yeah you never know)

'Cause everybody's gonna make it if they try (oh yeah)
And if you persevere through your fears, never hide. (yeah)
Fold your hands in a prayer to the sky
And let your worries wash away with the tides
And I'm singing

Now you've hit rock bottom and
You're feeling lost at sea, yeah (So lost, yeah)
Just keep your head above the water (Above the water)
And I know you'll find some way to breathe
When the tides they drag you down
When the tides they drag you down
Down under, further than you've ever been,
What I know
When the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out
Out so far, Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim

Whoa oh oh [3x]
Stay away from the bad tides
Whoa oh oh [3x] Yeah
Only go where there's good vibes

And you got to keep your chin up (And you gotta keep your chin up),
Keep your head held high (Keep your head held high)
Just forget about the bad tides (Just forget),
Let em roll on by (Let em roll)
And you got to keep your chin up (And you gotta keep that chin up),
Keep your head held high (Let em roll)
Just forget about the bad tides (Let em roll), let em roll on by

When the tides they drag you down
When the tides they drag you down
Down under (Down under), further than you've ever been,
What I know
When the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out (They pull me out)
Out so far, Lord teach me how to swim, (teach me) how to swim

Whoa oh oh [3x]
Stay away from the bad tides
Whoa oh oh [3x] Yeah
Only go where there's good vibes
Whoa oh oh [3x]
Stay away from the bad tides
Whoa oh oh [3x] Yeah
Only go where there's good vibes

(Stay away from the bad tides,
Only go where there's good vibes)

(Ha-h, that's dope)
