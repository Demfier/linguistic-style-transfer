 I saw you there,  so beautiful
 You stopped and stared,  so magical
Then  you asked me for my name
And we took an out town train
Before  you leave, get up to go
 I wanna know
Do  you like Shakespeare? Jeff Buckely?
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do  you like kissing when it's raining?
Making faces in the station?
Do  you like,  I need to know
What do  you like? before  you go
 You walk me home,  so wonderful
It starts to snow, it's incredible
Now we're walking up my street
And  you slowly turn to me
 You're three inches from my lips
But before we do this
Do  you like Shakespeare? Jeff Buckely?
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do  you like kissing when it's raining?
Making faces in the station?
Do  you like,  I need to know
What do  you like? before  you go, oh oh
Show me the place where  you come from
And the places  you dream of
 I wanna know everything  you are
But before we get that far
Do  you like,  I need to know
Do  you like, before  you go
Do  you like Shakespeare? Jeff Buckely?
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do  you like kissing when it's raining?
Making faces in the station?
Cause  I like Shakespeare? Jeff Buckely?
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do  you like kissing when it's raining?
Making faces in the station?
Do  you like, yea yea yea yea
