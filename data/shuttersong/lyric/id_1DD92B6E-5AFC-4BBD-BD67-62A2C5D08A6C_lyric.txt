A cripple walks amongst you all you tired human beings
He's got all the things a cripple has not working arms and legs
And vital parts fall from his system and dissolve in Scottish rain
Vitally he doesn't miss them he's too fucked up to care

Well is that you in front of me?
Coming back for even more of exactly the same
You must be a masochist to love a modern leper on his last leg
On his last leg

Well I crippled your heart a hundred times and still can't work out why
You see I've got this disease I can't shake and I'm just rattling through life
Well this is how we do things now yeah this is how the modern stay scared
So I cut out all the good stuff yeah I cut off my foot to spite my leg

Well is that you in front of me?
Coming back for even more of exactly the same
You must be a masochist to love a modern leper on his last leg
Well I am ill but I'm not dead
And I don't know which of those I prefer
Because that limb which I have lost
Well it was the only thing holding me up
Holding me up

Well I'm lying on the ground now and you're walking through the only door
Well I have lost my eye sight like I said I would
But I still know

And that is you in front of me
And you are back for even more of exactly the same
Well are you a masochist to love a modern leper on his last leg?
And you are not ill and I'm not dead
Doesn't that make us the perfect pair
Just you and me we'll start again
And you can tell me all about what you did today
What you did today
