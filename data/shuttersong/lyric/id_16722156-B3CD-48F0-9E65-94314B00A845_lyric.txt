Started from the bottom with a plan to get rich
So I could chill everyday like one bad bitch
But I'm stuck in the middle and I'm tryna get by
Yeah we all need a little, a little break some time

Oh my god, it's the weekend
Hands up for the weekend
Oh my god, it's the weekend
Hands up for the weekend

We can let go
Sipping rose
On that poolside
Mandalay Bay
Wanna be friends
Phoebe Buffay
Can't get enough of my hot tamale

Oh my god, it's the weekend
Hands up for the weekend
Oh my god, it's the weekend
Like every day

Shoop shoop
Shoo be doop doop
Doo doo doop
Shoo be doop doop

Like every day

Shoop shoop
Shoo be doop doop

Shoo be doop doop

My hustle pay enough I can pay my rent
Got a team up in Paris and I don't speak French
Got a dream that I'm chasing like it's already mine
Got a Monday I'm erasing, replacing it with tonight

Oh my god, it's the weekend
Hands up for the weekend
Oh my god, it's the weekend
Hands up for the weekend

We can let go
Sipping rose
On that poolside
Mandalay Bay
Wanna be friends
Phoebe Buffay
Can't get enough of my hot tamale

Oh my god, it's the weekend
Hands up for the weekend
Oh my god, it's the weekend
Like every day

Getting dumb in the morning
Dumb in the evening
Dumb like a cherry flav

Dumb in the morning
Dumb in the evening
Dumb like a cherry flav

Hey it's the weekend
Every day a weekend
Everybody listen up, listen up
Cause here comes the ice cream truck

Shoop shoop
Shoo be doop doop
Doo doo doop

Oh my god, it's the weekend

Sipping rose
On that poolside

Wanna be friends

Can't get enough of my hot tamale
Oh my god, it's the weekend
Hands up for the weekend
Oh my god, it's the weekend
Like every day
