Everyday, every word that I say, lip service
I'm okay, I'll deny what's beneath the surface
Without you here I don't know what I'm doing
Can't hide my fears, I tried but I'm in ruins

I could sit and lie to you
But what's the point, what's the use?
You can see I'm blind for you
You break the rules and I'm the fool who wants you badly no matter what you do
I still love you madly
With your every move

I want you so bad
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
I want you so bad

Ba da da da
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
I want you so

Where do you go when you go
I know I know but I pretend I don't

Where do you go far from home
You go you go but still I know!
Without you here I don't know what I'm doing
Can't hide my fears, I tried but I'm just human
I could sit and lie to you
But what's the point, what's the use?

You can see I'm blind for you
You break the rules and I'm the fool who wants you badly no matter what you do
I still love you madly
With your every move
I want you so bad

Ba da da da
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
I want you so bad
Ba da da da
Ba da da da

Ba da da da
I want you so bad
Oh, badly

A better day is on the way
When Saturday comes I'll leave yeah
I know the game we love to play
You walk I'll follow the leader, leader
I'll follow the leader, leader
'Cause you're my leader
Now I want you badly no matter what you do
I still love you madly
With your every move
I want you so bad
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
I want you so bad
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
I want you so bad
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
I want you so bad
Ba da da da
Ba da da da
Ba da da da (Save me, yeah)
I want you so
