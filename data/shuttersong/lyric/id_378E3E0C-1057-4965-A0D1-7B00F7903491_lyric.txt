The time is right
and we're far enough from home.
They fired blanks
but there's bullets in your bones.
When I woke up
I heard you singing songs.
Yeah you were right
you knew it all along.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Well I'm begging you.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Won't you tell me true.
Cause if I wanna be your man
you gotta please understand
I'm gonna take you to the setting sun.
I promise not to hurt no one.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
The lights go out
when everybody's home.
Craving love
but we need time to grow.
When I woke up
I heard this little song.
Yeah you were right
I knew it all along.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Well I'm begging you.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Won't you tell me true.
Cause if I wanna be your man
you gotta please understand.
I'm gonna take you to the setting sun.
I promise not to hurt no one.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Well I'm begging you.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Cause if I wanna be your man
you gotta please understand.
I'm gonna take you to the setting sun.
I promise not to hurt no one.
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
Ohh ohh ohh oh oh oh
When I woke up
I heard you singing songs.
Yeah you were right
you knew it all along.
