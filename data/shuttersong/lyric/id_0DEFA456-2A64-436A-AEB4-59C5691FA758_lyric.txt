Yeah you blow me up then I wait a little while cuz' I know, it's probably fine
Then you blow me off
Don't mean to laugh when your mad but you do this all the time
Alright yeah

You love me, hate me, it's crazy, baby you're so emotional
It kills me, thrills me, can't shake, I'll take this rollercoaster love

Screaming all night till the break of dawn, found a pair of my pants on my neighbor's lawn

Throw all my stuff outside, say goodbye and slam the door close
Call me all night, you cry, say you'll die if I don't come home
Turn me on and then go cold, you're so hot when you're psycho
Smile when I smile, that's why it's you and I and all your moodswings
