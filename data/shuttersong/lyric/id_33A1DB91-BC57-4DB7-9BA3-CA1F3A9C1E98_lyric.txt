I don't fall slow like I used to
I fall straight down
You've stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound

My parachute will guide me
Safely to ground
But now the cord's not working
And I see you staring me down

I won't fall in love
With falling
I will try
To avoid

Those eyes, oh
I think you would beat
The moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be

The very first thing that I missed
I was doing fine on my own
And there wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my air catcher

And I don't know if I want it back
I won't fall in love
With falling
I will try

To avoid
Those eyes
Cause I'm not sure
I want to give you

Tools that can destroy
My heart
And I just don't say
What you want to hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe

In talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly
I won't fall in love
With falling
I will try
To avoid
Those eyes
But now I'm here
To give you words
As tools that can destroy
My heart
