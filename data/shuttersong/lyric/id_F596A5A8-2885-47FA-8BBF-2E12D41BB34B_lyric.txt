If she was a dime I'd call her on the line

To come down and put it on me

It caused a scene when she burned into my atmosphere

Been on cloud nine but it's a matter of time

Till she gets released

Now I see she's been smoking since she landed here

I know what to say

But every time I'm with you I want to get it

Every time I miss I want to hit it

I-I

And every other day I need it every other way

Every time I'm with you I want to get it

Every time I miss, I want to hit it

How we get so (How we get so)

Hi-i-igh

We get so high, wooo

Hi-i-igh

We get so high, So high

No lie

It's the hardest damn thing I've tried to leave

And I'm hazey, cause I don't want to be that way

And it's a sign it's a matter of time till I get relief

Now I see it's so crazy how this happened to be

Dollar for a dollar, nickel for a dime

I put it all on the line

Cause every time I'm with you I want to get it

Every time I miss, I want to hit it

I-I

And every other day, I need it every other way

Every time I'm with you I want to get it

Every time I miss, I want to hit it

How we get so (How we get so)

Hi-i-igh

We get so high, wooo

Hi-i-igh

We get so high, So high

Down, down, down, down, down

(Going down)

It's been four days, three lives and

One too many times since we last kissed the sky

But this time, we're going down, down, down, down

Till I get so high

How we get so

Hi-i-igh

We get so high, wooo

We get so high, So high

So high x8
