Falling deeper, falling, as the river bursts it's banks.

The night is laced in red as the moon laps over us,

and the music from my fingers dances through her hair.

Please me she cries, as the flames get higher, every wave breaks desire.

Falling deeper, falling, as the river bursts it's banks.

We're swept into the swell, straight in darling we fell.

The stars shine like switch blade silver, in the water I was hers.

Please me she cries, as the flames get higher, every wave breaks desire.

Falling deeper, falling, as the river bursts it's banks.

High low fast slow.

As the river burst it's banks.

As the river burst it's banks.

As the river burst it's banks.
