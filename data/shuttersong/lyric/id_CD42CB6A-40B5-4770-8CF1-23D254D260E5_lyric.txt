Got, gotta it keep it, got, got, gotta

Got, gotta it keep it and it feels so right (feels so right)
Oh, oh (got, got, feels so right)
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim, watch them play for you
For you I'd be (whoa, whoa)
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot, but for I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen, I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody (got, got, gotta keep it close)
Every day, I bring the sun around, I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me, smile for me
I-I-I-I would take every second, every single time, spend it like my last dime
Step to the beat of my hear
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen, I just need somebody to love (oh, no, no, no, no, no)
I, I don't need to much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love (oh, whoa)
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear

I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love (yeah!)
And you can have it all, anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want I can't find 'cause, money can't find me
Somebody to love (oh, oh)

Find me somebody to love (got, got, keep it close, feels so right)
