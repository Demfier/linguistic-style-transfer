It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king

It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
Yeah
I'm just tryna live boss life all night
Never have to worry about a thing
It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
I'm just tryna live boss life all night

Never have to worry about a thing
Yeah, It ain't nothin' to a king, I just do this shit for real
Me and Sammy in this thing and we might just sip a little
In a party getting energized, women telling hella lies
Say they got a man, but got my lyrics all memorized
Up inside they brains and we don't do it for the fame
We just out here chasing money making millions to the name
It's a dream, been a dreamer ever since I was a boy
Touching people through my music that I thought they would enjoy
Would enjoy, got bars like a jail cell, tell them bitches farewell
Cause I'm grinding in the office call me Steve Carell
All my kings G, you know who the team is
Swagger on point, the kicks were the cleanest
In Arizona getting some, but I don't play for Phoenix

On my Einstein flow, you know, genius
Listen to the soundbite, girl, drop it down right

We gon' wear the crown right
It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
I'm just tryna live boss life all night
Never have to worry about a thing
It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
I'm just tryna live boss life all night

Never have to worry about a thing
Born to be a king, came out of the womb spitting
Who said that I'd make it big? Now tell me who didn't?
Who hated when things got a little bit complicated?
People said the game was getting overpopulated
They dedicated, concentrated, focused on my goals
Being scared up in this thing you know we on the roll
It ain't nothin' to a king, repeat it like you scared to love â€˜em
I don't want your girls there to suffer, buddy yeah we really low
Slow down every once in a while, no crowd in the hours of mine
Why not stay king of the town, that raised you in a juveniall
Doing bigger things than we could ever really dream of
With the same crew with everybody trying to be us
Shout out to the fans, you'll never understand

You're the reason that these people know just who I am
Listen to the soundbite, girl, drop it down right

We gon' wear the crown right
It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
I'm just tryna live boss life all night
Never have to worry about a thing
It ain't nothin' to a king
It ain't nothin' to a king
I'm just tryna live boss life all night

Never have to worry about a thing
Nothin' to a king man, this a dream man
Never stop kingin', nothing what it seem man
Nothin' to a king man, this a dream man
Never stop kingin', nothing what it seem man
Nothin' to a king man, this a dream man
Never stop kingin', nothing what it seem man
(It's a king man, never stop dreamin')
(Yeah, we kingin') nothing but some kings man
