I AM A CHORUS OF THE VOICES
THAT GATHER UP THE MAGNETS
SET BEFORE ME
I ATTRACT YOU AND REPEL YOU
A SCIENCE OF THE HEART
AND BLOOD AND MEANING
THE COLDNESS OF MOST BEAUTIES
IS A CHALLENGE THAT OUR YOUTH
MUST QUICKLY CONQUER
THERE IS NO TIME FOR GUILT
OR SECOND GUESSING, SECOND GUESSING
BASED ON FEELING
I AM THE TRUTH, THE BEAUTY
THAT CAUSES YOU TO CROSS
YOUR SACRED BOUNDARIES
I HAVE NO MORALS
SOME THINK ME CHEAP
AND SOMEONE WHO DESPISES
THE NORMALCY OF HEARTBREAK
THE PURITY OF LOVE
BUT I WORSHIP THE YOUNG
AND JUST FORMED ANGEL
WHO SITS UPON THE PIN OF LUST
EVERYTHING ELSE
BORES ME
I WANT TO SEE YOUR SUICIDE
I WANT TO SEE YOU GIVE IT UP
YOUR LIFE OF REASON
I WANT YOU ON THE FLOOR
AND IN A COFFIN YOUR SOUL SHAKING
I WANT TO HAVE YOU DOUBTING
EVERY MEANING YOU'VE AMASSED
LIKE A FORTUNE
OH THROW IT AWAY
FOR WORSHIP SOMEONE
WHO ACTIVELY DESPISES YOU
FOR WORSHIP SOMEONE
WHO ACTIVELY DESPISES YOU
I AM THE ROOT
I AM THE PROGRESS
I'M THE AGGRESSOR
I AM THE TABLET
THESE TEN STORIES
WORSHIP
WORSHIP
PAIN AND EVIL HAVE THEIR PLACE
SITTING HERE BESIDE ME
I OFFER THEM TO YOU AS SERVANTS
OF THE GOLD THAT YOU MUST GIVE
PAIN AND EVIL HAVE THEIR PLACE
SITTING HERE BESIDE ME
AND I'LL OFFER THEM, I OFFER THEM TO YOU
AS SERVANTS OF THE GOLD
THAT YOU MUST GIVE TO ME
I WANT TO SEE YOUR SUICIDE
I WANT TO SEE YOU GIVE IT UP, GIVE IT UP
YOUR YOUR LIFE OF REASON
I WANT TO SEE YOU ON THE FLOOR
AND IN A COFFIN, SOUL SHAKING
SOUL SHAKING
I WANT TO HAVE YOU DOUBTING
EVERY MEANING YOU'VE AMASSED
LIKE A FORTUNE, LIKE A FORTUNE
