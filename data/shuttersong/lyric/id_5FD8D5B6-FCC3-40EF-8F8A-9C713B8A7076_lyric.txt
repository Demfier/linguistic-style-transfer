The Blacker The Berry - Kendrick Lamar\n Six in the morn' fire in the street\n Burn baby burn that's all I wanna see\n And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain\n It's such a shame they may call me crazy\n They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'\n But homie you made me\n Black don't crack my nigga\n I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\n Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean\n Been feeling this way since I was 16 came to my senses\n You never liked us anyway fuck your friendship I meant it\n I'm African-American I'm African\n I'm black as the moon heritage of a small village\n Pardon my residence\n Came from the bottom of mankind\n My hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide\n You hate me don't you\n You hate my people your plan is to terminate my culture\n You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\n You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\n And this is more than confession\n I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\n I'm guardin' my feelings I know that you feel it\n You sabotage my community makin' a killin'\n You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga\n The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice\n The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice\n The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice\n The blacker the berry the bigger I shoot\n I said they treat me like a slave cah' me black\n Woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah' we black\n And man a say they put me inna chains cah' we black\n Imagine now big gold chains full of rocks\n How you no see the whip left scars pon' me back\n But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block\n All them say we doomed from the start cah' we black\n Remember this every race start from the black remember that\n I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\n Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean\n I mean it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society\n That's what you're telling me penitentiary would only hire me\n Curse me till I'm dead\n Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head\n Institutionalized manipulation and lies\n Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes\n You hate me don't you\n I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself\n Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt\n Watchin' me as I pull up fill up my tank then peel out\n Muscle cars like pull ups show you what these big wheels 'bout ah\n Black and successful this black man meant to be special\n Katzkins on my radar bitch how can I help you\n How can I tell you I'm making a killin'\n You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga\n The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice\n The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice\n The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice\n The blacker the berry the bigger I shoot\n I said they treat me like a slave cah' me black\n Woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah' we black\n And man a say they put me inna chains cah' we black\n Imagine now big gold chains full of rocks\n How you no see the whip left scars pon' me back\n But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block\n All them say we doomed from the start cah' we black\n Remember this every race start from the black remember that\n I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\n When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree\n This plot is bigger than me it's generational hatred\n It's genocism it's grimy little justification\n I'm African-American I'm African\n I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan\n I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius\n Excuse my French but fuck you no fuck y'all\n That's as blunt as it gets I know you hate me don't you\n You hate my people I can tell cause it's threats when I see you\n I can tell cause your ways deceitful\n Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle\n Thinkin' maliciously he get a chain then you gone bleed him\n It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war\n Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy\n Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door\n Beefin' with Pirus only death settle the score\n So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers\n Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"\n Or try to celebrate February like it's my BDay\n Or eat watermelon chicken and KoolAid on weekdays\n Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\n Or watch BET cause urban support is important\n So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\n When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me\n Hypocrite\n
