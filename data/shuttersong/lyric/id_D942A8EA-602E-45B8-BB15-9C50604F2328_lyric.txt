Deep, deep in our hearts, strangers apart,
Oh please come back to me, no more to leave, never to grieve

I give my world to you, send, send her away to her grieving,
I will never set you free, no more, no, no more a life without meaning,
You and I will fly away to love, in my mind,
Love, in my soul, I just can't let go,
Sadness fills my life, oh my fruitless plight,
Only heaven knows,

Tears, tears in the night, sorrow take flight,
Oh please come back to me, each we believe, never to grieve,

I give my world to you, send, send her away to her grieving,
I will never set you free, no more, no, no more a life without meaning,
You and I will fly to love, in my mind, love, in my soul,
I just can't let go, sadness fills my life,
Oh my fruitless plight, only heaven knows,

Sadness fills my life,
Sadness fills my life, oh,
Sadness fills my life,
Sadness fills my life, oh, oh, oh wow, oh

Send, oh send her away to her grieving,
You and I will fly away to love, in my mind,
Love, in my soul, I just can't let go,
Sadness fills my life, oh my fruitless plight,
Only heaven knows

Love, in my mind, love in my soul,
I just can't let go, sadness fills my life
Oh my fruitless plight, only heaven knows heaven knows,

Love, in my mind, love, in my soul,
I just can't let go heaven knows, sadness fills my life,
Oh my fruitless plight, only heaven knows heaven knows
