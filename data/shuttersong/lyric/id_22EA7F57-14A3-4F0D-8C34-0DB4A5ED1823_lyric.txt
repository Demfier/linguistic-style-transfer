I think I'm gonna lose my mind,
Something deep inside me, I can't give up,
I think I'm gonna lose my mind,
I'll roll and I'll roll 'til I'm out of luck,
Yeah, I'll roll and I'll roll 'til I'm out of luck.
I'm feeling something deep inside,
Hotter than a jet stream burning up,
I got a feeling deep inside,
It's taking, it's taking all I got,
Yeah, it's taking, it's taking all I got.
Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
It's been so long, it's been so long,
Maybe you were fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.
I think I'm gonna win this time,
Riding on the wind and I won't give up,
I think I'm gonna win this time,
I'll roll and I'll roll, 'til I change my luck,
Yeah, I'll roll and I'll roll, 'til I change my luck.
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
It's been so long, it's been so long,
You must be fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do,
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
It's been so long, it's been so long,
Maybe you were fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.
