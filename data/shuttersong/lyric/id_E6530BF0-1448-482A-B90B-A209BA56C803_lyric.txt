No chance no way I won't say it no, no

You swoon you sigh why deny it oh, oh

It's too cliche I won't say I'm in
I won't say I'm in
I won't say I'm in

Can you feel the love tonight? (can you feel the love tonight)
You needn't looked too far, yeah

The world for once, in perfect harmony, yeah

Love is where we are

Come stop your crying it'll be alright
Here, take my hand, and hold it tight

I will protect you from all around you
I will be here don't you cry

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on (this day on) now and forever more (forever more)
(Love is an open door) Yeah you'll be in my heart
(Love is an open door) No matter what they say
(Love is an open door)
With you, with you, with you
Love is an open door

I know you I danced with you once upon a dream
I know you the gleam in your eye is so familiar a gleam

And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you I know what you do
You'll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream.

I got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion
By reaching out for each other's hand

maybe we'll discover
What we should have known all a long, yeah

One way or another
Togethers where we both belong

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
for the first time ever we're seeing it eye to eye
Yeah, ee, yeah
If we listen to each other's hearts
we'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love's the reason why
For the first time ever were seeing it eye to eye
A whole new world
(Sha la la la la la my oh, my)
Seeing it eye to eye baby (let it go, let it go)
For the first time (True to your heart, you must be true to your heart)
For the first time
Can you feel the love tonight?
