Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I hold my hands up high
And throw my glass into the sky
And when the morning comes
We'll never see the sun
And if the walls close in
Then let's just start it all again
That's when the evening comes

Oh yeah, the evening comes.
No we're not going home tonight
Wake up the stars are shining
We'll do it, and we'll do it
And we'll do it again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?

Yeah last night think we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We have last night

Let's shut this party down
And pull the building to the ground
Yeah go let's live it up
One night is all we got

Let's dance until we die,
Nobody's going home tonight,
This kiss could be our last
Come on and raise your glass

No we're not going home tonight
Wake up the stars are shining
We'll do it, and we'll do it
And we'll do it again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?

Yeah last night think we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might have kissed someone
And if tomorrow never comes
We have last night

We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring your friends, and tell a friend to bring another friend
We do it all again
We do it all again
So by the end of night we can all be friends
We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring your friends, and tell a friend to bring another friend
We do it all again
We do it all again
So by the end of night

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?

Yeah last night we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might kissed someone
I hope tomorrow never comes
We have last night
Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?
Yeah last night we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might kissed someone
I hope tomorrow never comes
We have last night
