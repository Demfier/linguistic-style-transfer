All these different places
And pretty faces
Always see something new
I don't wanna bore ya
I'll try to show ya whatever I have to do

I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
Its not enough
Not enough for tonight
I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
Its not enough
Nothing enough for tonight

I can't wait forever
This just now or never
Don't want this to be over
Its just now or never

All the people see me
Sit down and hear me
There's nowhere I have to go
What I want to say
I'm not going away
Its something you should know

I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
Its not enough
Not enough for tonight
I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
Its not enough
Nothing enough for tonight

I can't wait forever
This just now or never
Don't want this to be over
Its just now or never

Don't want this to be over
Its just now or never
Its just now or never
Its just now or never
Its just now or never
Its just now or never
