Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid
Yeah he found a six shooter gun
In his dads closet hidden in a box of fun things
And I don't even know what
But he's coming for you yeah he's coming for you
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Faster than my bullet
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late yeah he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say your hair's on fire
You must have lost your wits yeah
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you'd better run better run
Faster than my bullet
