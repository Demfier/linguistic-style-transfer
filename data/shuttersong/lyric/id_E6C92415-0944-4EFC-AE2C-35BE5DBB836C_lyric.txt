Her fingers are cold on my skin
What is this hole that I'm in?
Taking my clothes off again
Feeling her warmth, but it ain't warm

I am stuck in this rut
Again caught up in this fake love again
I am feeling nothing

I am feeling nothing
What if we were blind
To the lives we left behind

What if we could rewind like a movie
I like the movies, yeah
I wish that I could feel again
That time with you was heaven sent

I wish that I could feel again
I wish that I could feel again
That time with you was heaven sent
I wish that I could feel again
