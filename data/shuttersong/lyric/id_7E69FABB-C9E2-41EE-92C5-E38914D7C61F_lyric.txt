Midnight
When you get there
Just hold her to your chest
Then walk you to the beach
To watch the birds fall from their nest

I'll ask where you're going
And what you're doing
You have no answer
Cause you're a wanderer wandering
You're a wanderer wandering
You're a wanderer
Wandering

And every second is a pounding drum
You're leaning over me to put another record on
And every other guess is just cold hard luck
Now the life is kid creole and the coconuts

Midnight when you get there
Just hold her to your chest
And tell her loves the best
For her
For you
For me

Does the world make you crazy
It made me crazy too
But I'm all out of hunger
Because I'm a wanderer wondering
I'm a wanderer wondering
I'm a wanderer
Wandering

When I whisper you can have me walking on it
I feel my heart go boom-boom for the first time in years
Now it's all making sense and I don't feel so mad
And all that it's left to do is sing it all loud

And we'll still be singing there all the way home
Cause you will always hear the thunder
When you're a wanderer, wandering
You're a wanderer, wandering
You're a wanderer
Wandering

PAUSE

I can't explain it I can't find the words right now
But, I feel like i'm drowning with no one holding me down
The fear clenches on my face
And I know in this life i've never lived
And the feeling when they stay they'll stop, but never did
And these tears prick my eyes no matter the place or the time
Oh how i've fallen I really couldn't even say why
As the water meets my chin
As I feel full to the brim
And I can see his eyes but I can't seem to hold them in
And I, feel tired all the time
I had a lover he called me a woman but I
Feel just like a child who needs cradling all of the time
And I know if this carries on
I'll lose him to another one
So I cross my hands to my heart
And try to be calm
And I, feel tired all the time
So tired, all this longing for his touch
All I need is his love
