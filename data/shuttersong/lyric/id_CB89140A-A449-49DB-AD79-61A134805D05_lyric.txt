Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turned the lock & put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do
I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early & you stand & wave
I walk to you

You pulled my chair out & helped me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break & burn & end
But on a Wednesday in a café
I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories & you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break & burn & end
But on a Wednesday in a café
I watched it begin again
And we walk down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
every single Christmas & I won't talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break & burn & end
Then on a Wednesday in a café
I watched it begin again
Then on a Wednesday in a café
I watched it begin again
