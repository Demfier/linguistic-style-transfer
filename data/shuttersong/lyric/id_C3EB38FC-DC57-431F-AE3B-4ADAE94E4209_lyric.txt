It's nice when the heart
The heart is beating faster
Feeling alive
When there is wanting
Always the same
I jump too quickly
Be still my soul
Is love so serious
The more we think
The less we know
Is love mysterious
Holding tight
When we should let go
Is love so serious
The more we think
The less we know
Is love mysterious
Holding tight
When we should let go
Now that this love
Has overcome me
Now that this fire
Is burning bright
All of these words
Seem just beyond my reasoning
Be still my soul
Is love so serious
The more we think
The less we know
Is love mysterious
Holding tight
When we should let go
Is love so serious
The more we think
The less we know
Is love mysterious
Holding tight
When we should let go
Is love so serious
The more we think
The less we know
Is love mysterious
Holding tight
When we should let go
Is love so serious
The more we think
The less we know
Is love mysterious
Holding tight
When we should let go
Just let it go
