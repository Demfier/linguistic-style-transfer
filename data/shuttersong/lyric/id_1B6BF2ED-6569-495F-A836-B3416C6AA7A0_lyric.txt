Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them

You're grown, so grown
Now I must say more than ever, come on Eileen
Toora loora toora loo rye ay
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty, ah come on Eileen

These people round here
Wear beaten down eyes sunk in smoke dried faces
So resigned to what their fate is
But not us, no never, no not us, no never
We are far too young and clever

Remember
Toora loora toora loo rye ay
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
Ah come on let's, take off everything
Pretty red dress, Eileen tell him yes
Ah come on let's, ah come on Eileen

That pretty red dress, Eileen tell him yes
Ah come on let's, ah come on Eileen, please

Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(Now you have grown, now you have shown)
Toora toora, too loora
(Oh Eileen)

(Said come on)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(These things that are real so, how you feel)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(Now I must say more than ever)
Toora toora, too loora
(Things round here change)
(I said toora loora)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(Toora loo rye ay)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Toora toora, too loora

Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty, ah come on Eileen

Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
In that dress oh my thoughts I confess
Well they're dirty, on Eileen

Come on Eileen, whoa what he means
Oh, ah come on, everything

{Oh believe me if all those endearing young chums
That I gaze on so firmly today
Were to suddenly leave you, oh fly in the night
Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky}
