I ain't never met a girl, like you
And you'll never find a man, like me
Walking out the door, with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want

Got me going mad, when you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap when you act like that (Yeah)
I ain't even mad when you dress like that (Skate)
I know you know you bad when you act like that

Oh yeah

Met a bad bitty from the state of Mississippi
Really pretty and I wanna take her home to see the city (in my city)
Doing your thing, got me insane
Walk in the mall and you cop me a chain
I was like damn,
You hot as a flame.
Your mom is the only one that you can blame
You so cute, girl, yeah you is a blessing
And I'm the reason that your boyfriend keep flexing
Never stop texting every time I see your name up in my phone
I'm just picturing your body in that dress and makeup on
You don't even need the makeup
Save that shit for later
You the baddest thing I seen I'm thanking your creator
Girl, I see you working like Miley Cyrus she twerking
I'm certain you'll be screaming for me when I close the curtains
But it's funny, 'cause I'm the one screaming now for you, baby
I been messing around with too many girls, I need a lady
