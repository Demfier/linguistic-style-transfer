You walked away without a sound
Sold your flat and left the town
No goodbye, no reply
And suddenly every song's about you

We should have made a better plan
I should have been a better man
And I would, if I could
But the truth is I'm choking on my halo

Wish that I was so much stronger
Thought I had a heart of steel
I can't hold it back no longer, no, no, no

'Cause I miss the pillow talk
And the moments that we've caught
Even though that all we had was nothing but a game
I miss the pillow talk
And the battles that we've fought
With every step I take on my eternal walk of shame
I miss our pillow talk

I'm weaving dreams on broken looms
While dripping tears in your perfume
Like a fool, out of love
