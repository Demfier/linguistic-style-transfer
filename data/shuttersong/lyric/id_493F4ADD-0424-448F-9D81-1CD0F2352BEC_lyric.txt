Witness, the power of the one and living God
over each and every nation, the prostitutes and frauds
the back-slidden, sin-ridden breakers of the law
the sick of singing, least-giving pharisees and all
of the people who haven't found their place
who love without purpose and they don a smiling face
slaves to the flesh, tongues sickening in taste
witness, the power of His everlasting grace:
I was once a little boy, slave to my flesh
a young bird trying to leave the safety of the nest
seeking out the pleasures that the world had to offer
unbelief flowing through my veins with no stopper
The law was written on my heart but I rejected it
I learned the art of apathy and I perfected it
expecting it to lead me down a path of gratification
drunk and intoxicated with my carnal sensations
Who could love a kid addicted to his own guilt
Who could heal a mind bent on suicidal tilt
Who could save a man hateful and lying
Who could ever love a fool hopeless and dying
Behold Jesus on the cross crucified
Behold Jesus on the cross crucified
Behold Jesus on the cross crucified
the Lamb married to the bride in blood, \
