Over on your island, counting your clocks
Moments move to months you're living like this too long
Into every evening, people dress up
Celebrating something let's invite everyone

Coming last call you stall and tell me
I will never be the one worth breaking
When everyone's gone come say what you mean, for once
Stumbling home we slowly find sleep
I will wake into the brightest morning
When everyone's gone come say what you mean, for once

If oceans are deep enough to drown in
And lightning may shoot me down
We're hoping that we were only children
It's war and I'm bolder now

Pull me towards your corner, holding your court
Sure I've seen you better, surely we've both been worse
Promises you earn like the ink on your back
Steps to see it first tell me how do I make it last

Coming last call you stall and tell me
I will never be the one worth breaking
When everyone's gone come say what you mean, for once
Stumbling home we slowly find sleep
I will wake into the brightest morning
When everyone's gone come say what you mean, for once

If oceans are deep enough to drown in
And lightning may shoot me down
We're hoping that we were only children
It's war and I'm bolder now

And all of my blessings just let me forget them
I need a night to fall apart
I slept in my front seat the cold cutting through me
I'm frozen in familiar dawn, woke reset a second start

If oceans are deep enough to drown in
And lighting may shoot me down
We're hoping that we were only children
It's war and I'm bolder now
