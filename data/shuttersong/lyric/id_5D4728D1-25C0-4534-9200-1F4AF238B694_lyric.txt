Exodus - Exodus\n It starts with life  a way to live\n I love the sound of pain\n The more it hurts the better I feel\n The world will fall insane\n It comes to me late late at night\n When I feel like being cruel\n Whip out the chains and get the knife\n And slay some innocent fool\n Get in our way and we're going to\n Take your life\n Kick in your face and rape and\n Murder your wife\n Plunder your town your homes\n They'll burn to the ground\n You won't hear a sound until\n My knife's in your back\n The exodus attack\n The filthy sound of death and pain\n Brings pleasure that I need\n The rotting hide the burning flesh\n The smell and I agree\n Bloody corpse makes me feel great\n Painkiller in my life\n Cut bare flesh to the bone\n Use a rusty knife\n Get in our way and we're going to\n Take your life\n Kick in your face and rape and\n Murder your wife\n Plunder your town your homes\n They'll burn to the ground\n You won't hear a sound until\n My knife's in your back\n And the exodus attack\n Buzzards eat as well as worms\n Nature s death machines\n Pin you on the desert floor\n Now you' re hell's cuisine\n I tell you all it's the way to live\n Get stronger on death glory\n Infringing on sacrificial rites\n Death's your final story get in our way\n And we're going to take your life\n Kick in your face and rape and\n Murder your wife\n Plunder your town your homes\n They'll burn to the ground\n You won't hear a sound until\n My knife's in your back\n And the exodus attack
