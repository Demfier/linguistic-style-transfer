blue bird blue bird 
sitting on my window
sill singing sweetly out into the morning chill 
pouring your heart out like words on a page 
yeah the notes float away to the sky

blue bird blue bird 
tell me what youʼre dreaming of lovely weather 
I donʼt know could it be love shine your feathers 
fly up and find her 
I really hope you do

thereʼs a song in your heart 
thereʼs a spring in your step 
while youʼre sending for the dreams you have 
that havenʼt happened yet

keep on sending those wishes 
keep on sending those words 
fly away to places 
where your little song can be heard 
and while youʼre perched on empty branches 
darling donʼt lose heart 
youʼre gonna get there 
youʼre gonna find your start

big white clouds sit proudly in the amber sky 
spinning thoughts all tangled up in lullabies 
shake the sleep off open up your tired eyes 
whatʼs a girl to do

Iʼm so tired of hearing darling 
whatʼs the fuss about 
youʼre still young 
youʼve got the time to figure these things out 
oh oh 
is that so
