You know I'm gon get ya, yeah,
Whatever it takes, get there,
No, I won't drop you,
Like everybody else does.

Forget about your friends they don't care where we go,

Forever, baby, we go,
Together baby we go, we go...

In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few,
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you,
Cause I finally found, I finally found you...

Girl I've been looking for you,
And when I saw you I knew,
