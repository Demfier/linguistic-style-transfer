Days go by, and you feel the heartbreak
Start to settle in like a dose of medicine, yeah
You better believe my whole life
I've been waiting for somebody like you
Could hold me down and keep the ropes tied
No lie, I never thought the day would come
When me and you would part ways

And even though we're in a hard phase
Can't forget looking up at the sky when we would stargaze
Yeah, I'm so amazed by what we had
And how it vanished in a blink of an eye
I was yours, you were mine

Unbelievable feelings would rush upon me everytime
I would look at you, but really look at you
Late nights, me and you and nobody else
We're better together as clich√© as it sounds
Let me break it down
If we could start over it, would mean the world to me
I'll make you happy as the girl-to-be

Give me a chance (one chance girl)
I need the soft touch of your skin
All I wanna hear is baby I'm in

You're the girl for me and I know that (know that)
You ain't gotta cut me no slack
Go step by step take it slow, yeah
I wanna make sure we get it right
We get it right this time

Okay, maybe I didn't give you enough attention
Maybe it was the girl I was supposedly kissin'
Maybe it was because I wouldn't take you out to eat
And I would rather make you somethin' in the kitchen
But whatever it is I'd rather talk it out
Than sit here and play these childish games
Speakin' of childish games

I'd go through chutes and ladders or to the end of a maze
To go back to the days when I was all that you crave
Together we laid a couple kids who together made up a couple of phase
By anything or anyone in their way
It's your choice if you leave or if you stay
Damn, I know you miss it too
And you know that I'm missin' you
And as long as the skies are blue, I'm right here

So, give me a chance (one chance, girl)
I need the soft touch of your skin
All I wanna hear is baby I'm in
You're the girl for me and I know that (know that)
You ain't gotta cut me no slack
Go step by step take it slow, yeah
I wanna make sure we get it right
We get it right this time

All I wanna hear is baby I'm in

You're the girl for me and I know that (know that)
You ain't gotta cut me no slack
Go step by step take it slow, yeah
I wanna make sure we get it right
We get it right this time
