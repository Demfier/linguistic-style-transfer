As long as you're cool
Right here is where you wanna be
This song gets you cool
Baby tell me how you like it

As long as you're cool
He- here is where you wanna be
This song gets you cool
Baby tell me how you like it

Now it's me and you (it's me and you)
Now

I've been waiting (waiting)
Think I wanna make a move, now

Baby, tell me if you like it (tell me if you like it)
It's me and you
Now
I've been waiting
Think I wanna make a move
Now
Baby, tell me how you like it
This song makes you cool
Right here is where you wanna be
(Baby tell me, baby tell me)

Right here is where you wanna be

(Baby tell me, baby tell me)
To me and you!
To me and you!

Now
I've been waiting
Think I wanna make a move
Now
Baby tell me if you like it (tell me if you like it)

It's me and you
Now
I've been waiting
Think I wanna make a move
Now
Baby tell me how you like it (like it, like it...)
Now it's me and you (and you, and you...)
Now
Now, it's me and you
Now
Think I wanna make a move
Now
