Waooooh
It's always a good time
Waooooh
it's always a good time

Woke up on the right side of the bed,
What's up with this prince song inside my head
Hands up if your down to get down tonight
Cause it's always a good time

Slept in all my clothes like i didn't care,
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if your down to get down tonight
cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight,
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
Waooooh oh uh oh

Waooooh
It's always a good time
Waooooh oh uh oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
(Good time, Good time)

It's always a good time
Waooooh
Feet down, drop my phone in the pool again
Checked out on my room, hit the ATM
Lets hang out, if your down to get down tonight

Cause it's always a good time
Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight,
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time (Wooh)
Waooooh oh uh oh
Waooooh
It's always a good time
Waooooh oh uh oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
Waooooh oh uh oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Doesn't matter when, it's always a good time then
Waooooh oh uh oh
Waooooh
It's always a good time
Waooooh oh uh oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time x2
