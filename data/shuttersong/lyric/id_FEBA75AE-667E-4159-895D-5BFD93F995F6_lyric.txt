It's the blackout, 'rari got the back out
Showin' my black ass engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Killed bin Laden, another four up in the black house

Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches out with money or with ass shots
Good, had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-Up gang hit the jackpot

Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal but still keep it ghetto, woo

Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels, you and LV Sport shoe on a pedal
I let you niggas settle, yeah

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind, on my mind
