You're attractive, little witch, you're beautiful. (Beautiful)
Your wickedness, little witch, it broke my heart. (I Broke your heart)
Enchanting words, little witch, you've cast a spell. (I Cast my spell)
Masked destroyer, little witch, my beautiful apocalypse.

You got me bewitched, 'cause I'm under your spell, Ohhh.
You must be a witch, 'cause I am living in Hell, Ohhh.
Now is the time, now is the hour.
I am the magic, I am the power, oh.
All I need is one star in the sky, wish for you every night.

I tricked you to fall in love, little boy.
I played with you 'til I was done, like a toy. (Like a toy)
Hard in love as I destroy the end of you. (The end of me)
So easily fooled, little boy, to think it's true. (I'm in love with you)

You got me bewitched, 'cause I'm under your spell, Ohhh.
You must be a witch, 'cause I am living in Hell, Ohhh.
Now is the time, now is the hour.
I am the magic, I am the power, Oh.
All I need is one star in the sky, wish for you every night.

Now is the time, now is the hour.
To take back my heart, to take back my power.
This is the moment to break your spell.
I see right through you
Now burn in Hell.
(You're gone)

Now is the time, now is the hour.
To take back my heart, to take back my power.
This is the moment to break your spell.
I see right through you
Now burn in Hell.
(So long)

Now is the time, now is the hour.
To take back my heart, to take back my power.
This is the moment to break your spell.
I see right through you...
(Burn in Hell, witch!)
You got me bewitched, 'cause I'm under your spell, Ohhh.
You must be a witch, 'cause I am living in Hell, Ohhh.
Now is the time, now is the hour.
I am the magic, I am the power, Ohhh.
All I need is one star in the sky, wish for you every night.
