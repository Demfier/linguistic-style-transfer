Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do it all the time
Do it all the time
make yourself right,
never mind them
Don't you know you're not the only one suffering

Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do it all the time
Do it all the time
make yourself right,
never mind them
Don't you know you're not the only one suffering

Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do it all the time
Do it all the time
make yourself right,
never mind them
Don't you know you're not the only one suffering

I see you up again wandering so diligently
crossing your t's as though it weren't irrelevant
they say formality, this is what they really meant:
they can be the walk and we can be the pavement

Do the right thing do the right thing
do it all the time do it all the time
make yourself right, never mind them
don't you know you're not the only one suffering

So what you're up against all the disingenuous
They wave you along and say there's always room for us
But we know better than that to take'em serious.
Still don't let'em make you bitter in the process

And when the light is up, this is how oughta be
We'll make it alright, they'll come around eventually
They say it's nothing but that ain't the reality
They may take us on but they can never take us easy

Cuz they ain't moving, they're just moving around
So if you love yourself, you better
Get out
Get out
Get out
Get Now

Do the right thing
Do the right thing
Do it all the time
Do it all the time
make yourself right,
never mind them
Don't you know you're not the only one suffering

I hear a higher calling
Better here than there I guess
so long (repeat)
