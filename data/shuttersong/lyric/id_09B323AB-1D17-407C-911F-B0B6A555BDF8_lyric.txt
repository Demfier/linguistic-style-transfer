Hold me down under the water
You know well that I can't swim
I'm not trying to be a martyr
Knowing that I'm gonna let you in
Safe and warm inside myself
You need more than someone else

You need space you need time
You take yours and I'll take mine
Come closer so I can be the one to push
It's not me it's just you
It's doesn't mean shit when it falls through
Come closer so I can be the one to push you
The one to push you

Hold me tight enough to kill me
Bite my tongue so I can't speak
Clip my wings so I can't fly
Bury me deep but I won't die
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?

You need space you need time
You take yours and I'll take mine
Come closer so I can be the one to push
It's not me it's just you
It's doesn't mean shit when it falls through
Come closer so I can be the one to push you
The one to push you

Guess I needed you enough not to notice
Guess I wanted you enough to lie
There's so many faces
I shoulda noticed
But that sure was a beautiful disguise

You need space you need time
You take yours and I'll take mine
Come closer so I can be the one to push
It's not me it's just you
It's doesn't mean shit when it falls through
Come closer so I can be the one to push you
The one to push you
But I can't forget the past
When we made love and when you?
Let me hold you
So you can be the one to push back
