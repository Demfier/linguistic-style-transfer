Take it slow but it's not typical 
He already knows that my love is fire 
His heart was a stone and then his hands round 
It turned him to gold and it's all good now 
But I'll be day-dream I'll be the favorite things  
We could be beautiful get drunk on the good life  
I'll take you to paradise 
Say you'll never let me go 
Deep in my bones I can feel you 
Take me back to a time when we knew how to be 
We could wait the night with an old film 
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom 
How did we 
Say you'll never let me go  
Say you'll never let me go  
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Say you'll never let me go 
Say you'll never let me go  
Say you'll never let me go  
Say you'll never let me go 
Deep in my bones I can feel you 
Take me back to a time when we knew how to be 
We could wait the night with an old film 
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom 
How did we 
Say you'll never let me go 
Say you'll never let me go 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Aah ah ah aah 
Say you'll never let me go 
Say you'll never let me go
