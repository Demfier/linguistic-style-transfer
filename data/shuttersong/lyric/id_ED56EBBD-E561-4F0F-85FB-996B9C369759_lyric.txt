Put your lighters in the air,
if you’ve ever felt scared,
‘cos you’ve lost the one, who was the one.

Put your lighters in the sky,
if you’re sleeping alone tonight,
‘cos you’ve lost the one,

You are my bestfriend and boyfriend
All at the same time
It’s funny to think I’ve known you
All my life, I can't even remember
A time when we weren’t together
Thinking back to the time where
You promised it would last forever
We only just learned what love was
But I tried to impress you with my
Lips and mouth, now I’m sitting
Here wondering where is the love
Only thing I have is a voice and a
Lighter, so

Put your lighters in the air,
if you’ve ever felt scared,
‘cos you’ve lost the one, who was the one.

Put your lighters in the sky,
if you’re sleeping alone tonight,
‘cos you’ve lost the one,

The one, The one
The one, The one

You was so young you
Couldn’t even say it
And these were at the park
At the swings, where we
Were just playing, but I
Remember everything that
You wrote, we go write it
On a post it note,
Iwrite Yes, then I gave it back
Hr said I could keep it
And I still got that, now
I’m sitting here wondering
Where did the love go
Only thing I have is a
Voice and a lighter, so

Put your lighters in the air,
if you’ve ever felt scared,
‘cos you’ve lost the one, who was the one.

Put your lighters in the sky,
if you’re sleeping alone tonight,
‘cos you’ve lost the one,

The one, The one
The one, The one

Back then it was so different,
I didn’t even have to ask you would listen,
we’ve been a couple since forever,
it’s so weird we ain’t together,
and every time I see you I want to cry,
and every time you look at me I die inside.
Now I’m sitting here wondering where’s the love gone.
Every one grab their lighters if they left you alone so

Put your lighters in the air,
if you’ve ever felt scared,
‘cos you’ve lost the one, who was the one.

Put your lighters in the sky,
if you’re sleeping alone tonight,
‘cos you’ve lost the one,

The one, The one
The one, The one
