If you wanna
Come on over, Abigail
We'll be playing around eleven,
Abigail

And you're blowing on my eye
Working double time
Come on over, Abigail

If you wanna
Come on over, Abigail
We'll be playing around eleven
Abigail

And you're blowing on my eye
Working double time
Come on over, Abigail

What I wanna say to you
I keep inside
What I wanna feel is true,
Its just a lie

And you're blowing on my eye
Working double time
Come on over, Abigail
