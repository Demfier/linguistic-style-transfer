 Just the way you are 
And when  you smile' 
 The whole world stops and stares for awhile 
Cause girl  you 're amazing 
 Just  the  way  you  are 
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me 
Her laugh' her laugh 
She hates but I think its so sexy 
She's so beautiful 
And I tell her every day 
Oh  you know'  you know'  you know 
Id never ask  you to change 
If perfect is what  you 're searching for 
Then  just stay  the same 
So don't even bother asking 
If  you look okay 
 You know I say 
When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change 
Cause  you 're amazing 
 Just  the  way  you  are 
And when  you smile' 
 The whole world stops and stares for awhile 
Cause girl  you 're amazing 
 Just  the  way  you  are 
 The  way  you  are 
 The  way  you  are 
Girl  you 're amazing 
 Just  the  way  you  are 
When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change 
Cause  you 're amazing 
 Just  the  way  you  are 
And when  you smile' 
 The whole world stops and stares for awhile 
Cause girl  you 're amazing 
 Just  the  way  you  are
