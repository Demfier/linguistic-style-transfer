I¡¯m living for the weekend but know   more
Cause she comes that for me your feeling
That Friday¡¯s famous for
Yeah  I¡¯m looking for some action
And it¡¯s out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity  on and in the air
And it may be just more off the same
But sometimes I wanna go out where   knows your name
So I guess I¡¯ll have to wait and see
But I¡¯m just gonna let something brand new happen to me
And it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right
Bright lights bigger city belongs to us tonight  tonight
Friday¡¯s cool but there¡¯s something about Saturday night
You can¡¯t say what you won¡¯t do cause you know you just might
Our lives this evening it was love at first sight
This Saturday and every Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone standing in line
Yeah  looking good and looking for a real good time
And I never had to wonder if
I¡¯ll have someone to share out of this wish
And it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right
Bright lights bigger city belongs to us tonight  tonight
Guess I need it  everybody does
Got tells and conversation  music and making love
And it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right  it¡¯s all right
Bright lights bigger city belongs to us tonight  tonight X 2
