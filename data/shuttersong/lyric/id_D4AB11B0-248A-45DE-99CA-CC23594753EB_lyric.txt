Let it go let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling
Like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried
Don't let them in
Don't let them see
Be the good girl
You always have to be
Conceal don't feel
Don't let them know
Well now they know
Let it go let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand and here I'll stay
Let it go let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind
But I'm too relieved to grieve
Let it go let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand and here I'll stay
Let it go let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
Standing frozen
In the life I've chosen
You won't find me
The past is all behind me
Buried in the snow
Let it go let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand and here I'll stay
Let it go let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
Yeah whoa
Let it go yeah
Na na
Here I stand
Let it go let it go oh
Let it go
