Think the clouds are clogging up my brain
Like the way the drain stame is the tears on my Face
And i'm stuck up in this storm  I
I guess i'll be alright  oh  uh oh  uh oh  Oh  Oh  uh oh  uh oh 
Then it hits me like  Oh  uh oh  uh oh  Oh No  uh oh  uh oh 
And you're that wind that swept me off my feet
Got me flyin' till im cryin' and i'm down on my knees
That's what Dorthy was afraid of
The sneaky tornado  Oh  uh oh  uh oh  Oh Oh  uh oh  uh oh 
There's no place like
Home  Ho-woam
I'm boarding up the windows
Lockin' up my heart
It's like everytime the wind blows
I feel it tearin' us apart
Everytime he smiles  I
Let him in again
Everything is fine when
You're standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
I'm floppin' on my bed like a flyin' squirrel
Like a little girl hurt by the big bad world
Yeah  It's twistin' up my insides
K-notted on the outside  OH uh oh  uh oh  Oh Oh  uh oh  uh oh 
Then it hits me like  Oh  uh oh  uh oh  Oh no
And thats when you hold me  you hold me
You tell me that ya know me
I'll never be lonely
Say we made it through the storm now
But i'm still on the look out  Oh  uh oh  uh oh  Oh Oh  uh oh  uh oh 
The airs gettin' cold  Cold
I'm boarding up the windows
Lockin' up my heart
It's like everytime the wind blows
I feel it tearin' us apart
Everytime he smiles  I
Let him in again
Everything is fine when
You're standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
He pickes me up  Like
He's got the way of the hurricane
And I think i'm fine  like
I'm In the eye of the hurricane
Yea He pickes me up  Like
He's got the way of the hurricane
And I think i'm fine  like
I'm In the eye of the hurricane
But i'm floatin' floatin'
And i dont know when  know when
I'm gonna drop
He's got the way
He's got the way
I'm boarding up the windows
Lockin' up my heart
It's like everytime the wind blows
I feel it tearin' us apart
Everytime he smiles  I
Let him in again him in
Everything is fine when
You're standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
Here comes the sun
Here comes the rain
Standin' in the eye of the Hurricane
In the eye
He pickes me up  Like

And I think i'm fine  like

Ooooooo  Oo  Oooooo
