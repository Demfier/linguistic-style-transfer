Can you hear me now?
Can you feel me now?
Beat makes me wanna get loud
Like a heartbeat, boom booming
808's run through my system

I want you to move with this
You know you just can't resist
Enter this trance, come on and dance now
Come and let your body in tune with me
Come and get close to me
Follow my lead, I'mma show you how

Listen to the drums go hard
Like a marching band
Repeating every step, every sound, every word

Bass comes in like bum, pum, pum, pum
Trumpets go up like pum, pum, pum, pum
Harmony's in like pum, pum, pum, pum
Everybody sing loud, pum, pum, pum, pum

And it goes like
Gonna beat my drum like pa rum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Everybody now, move your body now
Yell loud as soon as the bass drops
So get moving, zoom zooming
Is it in you like it's in me?

I want you to move with this
You know you just can't resist
Enter this trance, come on and dance now
Come and let your body in tune with me
Come and get close to me
Follow my lead, I'mma show you how

Listen to the drums go hard
Like a marching band
Repeating every step, every sound, every word

Bass comes in like bum, pum, pum, pum
Trumpets go up like pum, pum, pum, pum
Harmony's in like pum, pum, pum, pum
Everybody sing loud, pum, pum, pum, pum

And it goes like
Gonna beat my drum like pa rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
And it goes like
Gonna beat my drum like pa rum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Listen to the drums go hard
Like a marching band
Repeating every step, every sound, every word
Now stomp your feet onto the beat
Now clap your hands and beat your chest
Like we the best, now everybody yell out loud
Into the crowd, when the beat goes, pum, pum, pum, pum
And it goes like
Gonna beat my drum like pa rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
And it goes like
Gonna beat my drum like pa rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
