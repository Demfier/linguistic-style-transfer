You know, you know
You know, you know

You know how it goes
When you fall for the wrong one
I love you, I hate you
It ain't cool, it's fucked up
Crazy how two people fall in love with each other
Just to turn around and hurt one another
It's fucked up
You know how it goes
When you fall for the wrong one

You may have been the wrong one, but we met at the right time
Late night dinner date, sipping white wine
After hours, downtown like we fight crime
When you with someone around the clock, might find
That you learn to depend on each other
Then get sick of each other
Man, I miss how we used to be when we were so damn into each other
Every day I discover, something new about you
I put no one above you, you would ask \
