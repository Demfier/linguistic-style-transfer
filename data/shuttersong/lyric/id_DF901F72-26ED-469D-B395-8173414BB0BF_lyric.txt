Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules

Of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts

Close my eyes: and leap!
It's time to try
Defying gravity
I think I'll try
Defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye
I am defying gravity

And you wont bring me down!
I'm through accepting limits
