
At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't

So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know

Always there with a smile saying you're not alone

Sayin' la la la la Que Sera

(Oh! Here we go yo)

Yesterday is history (oh!) you gotta get through it (hey) tomorrow's a mystery (so!) let's just do it (hey)

And even when the rain falls, you and I will stand tall (hey) no matter what you go through, I'll never leave you

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't

(Oh!) When it's been a long day, had enough, given up, it ain't okay (okay)

And we don't care what the world say, we spread love it's the only way

So you gotta be strong (strong) live by the words of the song (song) together is where we belong (long) never stop dreamin', keep holdin' on

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't

So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know

Always there with a smile saying you're not alone

We keep fallin', but the, world keeps spinnin', and I, might stop winnin', just as long as I got you by my side

We keep fallin', but the, world keeps spinnin', and I, might stop winnin' but I know that we're gonna be alright

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
