pick my keys up and pack my bag let go of my home
say goodbye to the people I love
and the people that give
when my time comes run I'll learn to let you go
when that time is I will go and live on my own

I'll go on my own (yeah)

I'll remember the days went beneath your clothes
I'll remember the people who help me grow
I will build a house on the road
I'll remember your face when my time is alone
time is alone
so I'll pick up my keys head up north where no one to
say that I can't live my life with out a home
