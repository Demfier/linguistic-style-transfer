Oh the mountain top
Oh the visions stop
And I will reap the locust crop 'cus I love you like a mountain

Oh the mountain top
Oh the bleedings stopped
And down goes the hatchet on the chopping block 'cus I love you like a mountain
Oh the human race
Oh the prophet's face
And all god's people find their place
and I love you like a mountain

And out in the woods lighting struck
And I saw death in the eye of a buck
Tied to a tree, drowned in the muck
Everything had changed
And we grew up with birds and bees
We'd go swimming, we'd climb trees
We would skate when the ice would freeze
We came up the same
We were both the same

Oh the mountain top
Oh the visions stopped
And I will reap the locust crop 'cus I love you like a mountain

Oh the mountain top
Oh the bleeding stopped
And I will reap the locust crop 'cus I love you like a mountain

Oh the human race
Oh the devil's face
And all god's creatures find their place 'cus I love you like a mountain
I love you like a mountain
I love you like a mountain
