Hey oh, I saw you walkin' by my way so
I thought I would come over and say hello
To you right now
But when I tried to speak the words won't come out
It's you girl, it's definetly something you do girl
That's got my heart beating over time
When you're around
It's like you lift me up and I can come back down
I used to keep my feelings all to me
But now my heart's right on my sleeve for all to see

Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love

Oh you're my sunlight
You're my everything's going to be alright
The only thing I need is my life
From day to night my troubles disappear when you hold me tight
And I know I'll never find another like you
So I promise that I'll never let you go
You're all I need, 'cause baby without you I'm just not me

If this is somehow just all a dream
Then please just let me stay
Oh I just want to stay asleep

Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love

And if the stars fall from the sky
I'll pick them up for you, baby
'Cause you're the only reason why I wake up in the morning, baby
And I might sound a little too far for me to say, but I'ma do it anyway
'Cause I think that this could mean, girl
That I, I want to be every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
