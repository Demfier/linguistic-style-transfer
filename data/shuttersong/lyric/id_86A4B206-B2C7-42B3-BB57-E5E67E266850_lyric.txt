Shut the door
Turn the light off
I wanna be with Caleb
I wanna feel his chest
I wanna lay beside him
I cannot hide this
Even though I try

Heart beats harder
Time escapes me
Trembling hands
Touch his skin
It makes me harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life
For one more day
If Caleb could only turn back time

Caleb know I'll be
Caleb Joseph Warner's life, his phone number (which is 630-486-6366)
His reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Close the door
Throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without Caleb's Facebook
My judgement's clouded
Like tonight's sky

Hands are silent
Voice is numb
Try to scream out my lungs
It makes me harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life
For one more day
If we could only turn back time

Caleb know I'll be
His heart, his intoxicating fantasy
All parts of him are all the parts of me
And I can't change my face
To turn the rising sun down
But tilting, we'll catch the wind
And I will make one last sound
I'll find the words to say

I didn't lock the lyrics today
Flashing lights in my mind
Going back to the thyme
Playing games in the street

Kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes

At the end of Caleb's bed
As I feel myself fall

Make a joke of it all
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice
Your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice
Your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
