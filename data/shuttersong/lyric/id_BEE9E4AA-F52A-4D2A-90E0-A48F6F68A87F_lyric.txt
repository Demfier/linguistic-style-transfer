Dance Anthem Of The 80's - Regina Spektor
You   are   so   sweet   
Dan   cing   to the   beat
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and the girls watch each other eat
You are  so sweet  so sweet
Dancing and moving to that beat  that beat
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and the girls watch each other eat
The boys and the girls watch each other eat
When they really just wanna watch each other
Sleeeeeleeeleeeeep
They want to watch
To watch each other
Sleep  sleep  sleep
Sleeeeeleeeleeeeep
They want to watch
To watch each other
Sleep  sleep  sleep
You  Are  So  Sweet 
Once more
You  Are  So  Sweet 
Solo
I went walking
Through the city
Like a drunk but not
With my slip
Shown a little
Like a drunk but not
And I am
One of your people
But the cars don't stop
And I am
One of your people
But the cars don't stop
It's been a long time since before I've been touched
Now I'm getting touched all the time
And it's only a matter of whom
And it's only a matter of when
An addiction to hands and feet
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and girls watch each other eat
When they really wanna watch each other sleep
An addiction to hands and feet
There's a meat market down the street
The boys and girls watch each other eat
When they really wanna watch each other sleep
Sleeeeeleeeleeeeep
They want to watch
To watch each other
Sleep  sleep  sleep
Sleeeeeleeeleeeeep
They want to watch
To watch each other
Sleep  sleep  sleep
They want to watch
To watch each other
Sleep  sleep  sleep
They want to watch
To watch each other
Sleep  sleep  sleep
