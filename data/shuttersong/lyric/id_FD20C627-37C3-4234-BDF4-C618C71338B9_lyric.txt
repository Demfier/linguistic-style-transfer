Take it easy, baby take it easy
Can you feel me, can you feel me?
Take it easy, baby take it easy
The way you tease, I believe that you can please me
See, young brother got to know ya
Tonight something finna go down
Girl, you promised me a showdown
Cause your friends done gave me the love down
The way that you move and applaud now
Pretty girl, I can see you're abroad now
How you made different your approach now
Take it easy, baby take it easy
Can you feel me, can you feel me?
Take it easy, baby take it easy
The way you tease, I believe that you can please me
Take it easy, baby take it easy
Can you feel me, can you feel me?
Take it easy, baby take it easy
The way you tease, I believe that you can please me
The way that you're grinding against me
I forgot you were wearing them jeans
Mi surround I was there in them keys
Not to worry cause I got the plan B
Now you want me in the taxi
Mind you and the dress in the back seat
His rearview mirror is a flatscreen
Such a pervert, if you ask me
But baby take it easy, baby take it easy
Can you feel me, can you feel me?
Take it easy, baby take it easy
The way you tease, I believe that you can please me
Take it easy, baby take it easy
Can you feel me, can you feel me?
Take it easy, baby take it easy
The way you tease, I believe that you can please me
