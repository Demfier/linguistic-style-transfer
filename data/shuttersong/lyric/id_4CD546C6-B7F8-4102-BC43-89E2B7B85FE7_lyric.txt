Neither one of us is getting out of here alive
Both of us are stranded and we won't make it back inside
The whole world is blowing away, we just watch it pass us by
We're swept up off our feet when we meet in the northern sky
Like thunder and lightening, go into one
Together we make the perfect storm
You're like the wind, I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes
Hurricanes, hurricanes, hurricanes, hurricanes
We're heading towards each other at a hundred-fifty miles an hour
Knocking us off course, with the force, once you feel the power
We're tryna get away, tryna clear the path

From everything we buried in the aftermath
Swell like a supercell, raging getting louder and louder
We're thunder and lightening, go into war
Together we make the perfect storm
You're like the wind, I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes,
Hurricanes, hurricanes, hurricanes, hurricanes
On my own, just another cold, rainy day
before the winter comes along to take me away
She's just a breeze on a sunny day
But it's the two of us together and we're blown away
We're thunder and lightening, go into one
Together we make the perfect storm
You're like the wind, I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes,
Hurricanes, hurricanes, hurricanes, hurricanes.
