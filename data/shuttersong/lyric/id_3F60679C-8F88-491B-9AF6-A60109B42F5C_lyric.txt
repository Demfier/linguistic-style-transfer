Worn out and faded
The weakness starts to show
They've created
The generation that we know
Washed up and hated
The system moves too slow
They give us answers
To questions they don't even know

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

Used up and jaded
You're thinking way too slow
So we're creating
Answers on our own
We can't relate
To what you think you know
And you create
The problems that will never go away

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is over

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is over
