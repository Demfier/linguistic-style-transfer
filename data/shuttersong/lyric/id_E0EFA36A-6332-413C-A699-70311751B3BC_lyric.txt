Can't Help Falling in Love - Haley Reinhart

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Oh shall I stay Would it be a sin
Oh if I can't help falling in love with you
Woah like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
Oh for I can't help falling in love with you
Woah like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be
Woah take my hand take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Oh for I can't help falling in love with you
