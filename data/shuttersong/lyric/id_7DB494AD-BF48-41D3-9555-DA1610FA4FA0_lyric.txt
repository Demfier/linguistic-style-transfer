Lemons are bitter
If you bite them with
your two front teeth.
Now he's acting similar
'Cause You're the one
Now that's biting me

His feelings are crushed
Like rock salt on the table
Cause you're now the one
That's got a bit more flavour
And I've never met Someone that's
Made me feel quite this way

And I've never met someone that's
Actually stayed
Woah

Cause only love can make me feel the way I do
And only love can make this real for me and you
And only love can make me feel the way I do
And only love can make me see world the way I do

Now I'm with you
He passed his sell by date
He don't go out cause he'll turn sour but
I could think of a million ways
We could spend just one hour

His feelings are crushed
Like rock salt on the table
I guess, I feel for love says the paper
And I've never met someone that's
Made me feel quite this way
And I've never met someone that's
Actually stayed
Woah

Cause only love can make me feel the way I do
And only love can make this real for me and you
And only love can make me feel the way I do
And only love can make me see the world the way I do

Now I'm with you
(Oh oh oh oh)
Don't let me go
Cause I'm falling for you
(Oh oh oh oh)
I wanna know
If you're falling for me too

And I've never met someone that's
Made me feel quite this way
And I've never met someone that's
Actually stayed
Woah

And only love can make me feel the way I do
And only love can make this real for me and you
And only love can make me feel the way I do
And only love can make me see the world the way I do

Now I'm with you.
