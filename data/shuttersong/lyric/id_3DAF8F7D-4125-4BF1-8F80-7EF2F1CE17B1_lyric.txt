Time's a ticking hearts are running
Think that Cupid's up to something
You ask me how I feel I say nothing
But lately colors seems so bright
And the stars light up the night
My feet they feel so light
I'm ignoring all the signs
I keep on frontin
They ask they bluffin
I keep wondering
Keep you hunting for my lovin
But I crave us hugging
You ask stay stubborn
Cause I can't admit that you got all the strings
And know just how tug em

I think I'm in love again
In my head yeah you're in my head
I think I'm in love again
In my head yea you're in my head
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love

My heart's pacing
I'm confused I'm dazing
I saw something I never seen in you it's got me shaking
I must be hallucinating
I hear it happens, I'm just saying
Babe I'm just saying
Someone give me some paper
Someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child
I need something to play on
I'm trying hard to trust ya
When you say give me your hand
Baby I'm falling
I hope you catch me when I land

I think I'm in love again
In my head yea you're in my head
I think I'm in love again
In my head yea you're in my head
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love

In my dreams you're the dutch and I'm the dutchess
And your blunts are always loose
So I'm in charge of rolling dutches
And we getting so high
We always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches
That turn into late lunches
And we aint got a label
We just rolling with the punches
I make fun of your belly
And tell you to do some crunches
And you say well yea your ass jiggles
Go do some lunges
I say fuck you
While I'm thinking of you as my husband

I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love again
In my head yea you're in my head
Baby I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
In my head yea you're in my head
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love

I think I'm in love again
