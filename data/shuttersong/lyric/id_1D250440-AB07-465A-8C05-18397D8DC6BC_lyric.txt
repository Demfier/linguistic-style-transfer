Oh no, the pennies dropped.

How did my focus stop?

I never let desire lead me blind.

I can¡¯t get enough.


Oh no, the force is strong.

You know ya done me wrong.

I never let a feeling lead my mind.

I gotta rise above.


Don¡¯t need to fret.

Cause if I was to take you home,

What¡¯s left when the danger¡¯s gone?

I never let a feeling lead my mind.


Would you like to know me better, baby?

Then what you could show me is better, maybe?

Well, I sure don¡¯t wanna waste your time.

Sure don¡¯t wanna waste your time.

So let me tell ya that I¡¯d be better off without you.


Duck down, the bull is gone.

Slow motion, switch me on.

I never let desire lead me blind.

Won¡¯t give it up.


Freeze frame, I dodged that shot.

The bigger picture¡¯s not good enough.

I never let a feeling lead my mind.

I gotta rise above.


Don¡¯t need to fret.

Cause I would rather be alone,

Than with you in the danger zone.

I never let a feeling lead my mind.


Would you like to know me better, baby?

Then what you could show me is better, maybe?

Well, I sure don¡¯t wanna waste your time.

Sure don¡¯t wanna waste your time.

So let me tell ya that I¡¯d be better off without you.


There I said I¡¯m better off without you.

There I said I¡¯m better off without you.

There I said I¡¯m better off without you.

There I said I¡¯m better off without you.


Would you like to know me better, baby?

Then what you could show me is better, maybe?

Well, I sure don¡¯t wanna waste your time.

Sure don¡¯t wanna waste your time.

So let me tell ya that I¡¯d be better off without you.
