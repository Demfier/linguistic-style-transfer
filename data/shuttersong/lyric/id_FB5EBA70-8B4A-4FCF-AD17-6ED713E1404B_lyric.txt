I do what I love
I do what I love and I love what I do

How many times do I need to, need to fight you baby
Just to get that it's no good
And I know that I'm strong but my mind's almost gone
And it's getting on my mood
And all this buzzing you been doing see you got me hanging up
See you really got me worse
But I got to move on, baby 'cause bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work

I can't ask for your permission
I can't wait for it
'Cause I was born free
And I ain't taking shit

I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me, I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me, I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

How many hits do you need for me to get it in you
(Me to get it in you)
And I'm strong and my heart, in my heart it won't change
For anyone or anything
And if you're crying about your lover 'cause your lover is a dick
This will get you over it
But you got to move on, baby 'cause bitches got to eat
And I gotta do my shit

I can't ask for your permission
I can't wait for it
'Cause I was born free
I ain't taking this

I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me, I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me, I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

I do what I love and I love what I do
I do what I love and I love what I do
Get the move right baby, I'll show what I mean
Get the move right baby, I'll show what I mean

Get the move right
Get the move right
Get the move right
Get the move...

I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me, I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me, I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

I do what I love and I love what I do
