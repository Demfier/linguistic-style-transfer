Lucky - Jason Mraz/Colbie Caillat\n Written by£ºJason Mraz\n Do you hear me \n I'm talking to you\n Across the water across the deep blue ocean\n Under the open sky oh my  baby I'm trying\n Boy I hear you in my dreams\n I hear your whisper across the sea\n I keep you with me in my heart\n You make it easier when life gets hard\n I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend\n Lucky to have been where I have been\n Lucky to be coming home again\n Oooohhhh\n They don't know how long it takes\n Waiting for a love like this\n Every time we say goodbye\n I wish we had one more kiss\n I wait for you I promise you  I will\n I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend\n Lucky to have been where I have been\n Lucky to be coming home again\n I'm lucky we're in love every way\n Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed\n Lucky to be coming home someday\n And so I'm sailing through the sea\n To an island where we'll meet\n You'll hear the music  fell the air\n I put a flower in your hair\n And though the breeze is through trees \n Move so pretty you're all I see\n Let the world keep spinning round\n You hold me right here right now\n I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend\n Lucky to have been where I have been\n Lucky to be coming home again\n I'm lucky we're in love every way\n Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed\n Lucky to be coming home someday\n Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh\n Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
