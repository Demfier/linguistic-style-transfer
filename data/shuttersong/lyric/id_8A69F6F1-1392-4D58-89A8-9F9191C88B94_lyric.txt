I've been smoking, I'm going loco
Burning rubber with the, now you niggas won't notice
Riding around [?], YEAH!
Hold up, let me hit them [?], there you go, it's fucking shit up
I don't want to fuck with any
Anybody tryna fingerfuck me when it come to these pennies
Since we grew up, we blew up, now the cup that I sip got the Henny
Hit the pussy if she let me
She run around, yeah, accept it
Them juices probably taste like blessings
I got a fetish
Tossing some lettuce, say I can do better
Girl, I'm a menace, please call me Dennis it's not even a question
Sauce on this green like it's dressing
Fuck her brains out, no Montana
Like my white ones like Madonna
And my soul sisters filled with drama
And the rest I love her cause of culture
I'll eat anything, I'm a vulture
I should change my name to Sosa
I should change my name to Hov
I should go and switch my motto
But before we go let's grab some hoes
Garlic on my front door
You vampires is some trolls
[?] this is my goal
They wanna hope that I'm gon' explode
They want to suck and fuck my chode
But y'all ain't worth the door call
Sorry, just waking up, where we at in here
Actually, hold your breath, I'm getting out of here

I'd rather not listen to bullshit, can you please shut your mouth?
Can't you see I cannot figure it out?
I'd rather not listen to bullshit, can you please shut your mouth?
Girl, your ass is all I can think about
I'd rather not listen to bullshit, can you please shut your mouth?
Let's play games, [?] would call me down
I'd rather not listen to bullshit, can you please shut your fucking mouth?
I just want to live my fucking life wild

Azizi Gibson, the wild boy
Kamandi, the wild child
Together we are wild times two
Simple math, fuck you thought it was
