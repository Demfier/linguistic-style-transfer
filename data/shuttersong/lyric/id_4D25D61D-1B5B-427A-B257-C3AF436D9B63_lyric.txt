Erect a monument to me
For I alone am your king
The virgin sand is my queen
a royal legend I will be

I'll build a kingdom for the age
River of life points the way
All hear the prayer that we sing
Welcome to the valley of the kings

Even the light worships the sun
Remember everything I've done
And let this stone forever bring
Life to the valley of the kings

Erect a monument to me
For I alone am your king
All hear the prayer that we sing
Welcome to the valley of the kings
