An ancient business, a modern piece of glasswork
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion

The whole, immortal corporation's given its permission
The little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another

Out in both directions, a thousand little Julias
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Oooh!
Oooh oooh oooooh ooh x4

Around the corner, the house that modern art built
I ask for modern art to keep it out the closets
The people who might own it, the sins of pride and envy

And on the second floor the Richard Serra skatepark
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once
Oooh!
Oooh oooh oooooh ooh x4

Sit on the park wall, ask all the right questions
