We Wanna - Alexandra Stan/Inna Daddy/Yankee
We wanna dance till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From argentina to morocco
We wanna dance
It's about to go
It's about to go
'Bout to go hey
Down down down down
It's about to go
Down in the rough part of town
There's an epidemic going around
I get the fever when I hear that song
I can't help it I gotta move right now
When I hit the drums start to play
I let my body run away eh eh
I wanna party like everyday eh eh
If you're with me let me hear you say
Do we wanna stop it no way
Do we let the cops in no way
We about to rock this whole place
What do we want
We wanna dance till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From argentina to morocco
We wanna dance
It's about to go
