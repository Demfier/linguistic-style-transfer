Let it go  let it go\n Can't hold it back anymore\n Let it go  let it go\n Turn my back and slam the door\n The snow glows white\n On the mountain tonight \n Not a footprint to be seen\n A kingdom of isolation\n And it looks like I'm the queen\n The wind is howling\n Like this swirling storm inside\n Couldn't keep it in \n Heaven knows I tried\n Don't let them in \n Don't let them see \n Be the good girl\n You always have to be\n Conceal  don't feel \n Don't let them know\n Well  now they know\n Let it go  let it go\n Can't hold it back anymore\n Let it go  let it go\n Turn my back and slam the door\n And here I stand and here I'll stay\n Let it go  let it go\n The cold never bothered me anyway\n It's funny how some distance\n Makes everything seem small\n And the fears that once controlled me\n Can't get to me at all\n Up here in the cold thin air\n I finally can breathe\n I know I left a life behind\n But I'm too relieved to grieve\n Let it go  let it go\n Can't hold it back anymore\n Let it go  let it go\n Turn my back and slam the door\n And here I stand  and here I'll stay\n Let it go  let it go\n The cold never bothered me anyway\n Standing frozen\n In the life I've chosen\n You won't find me\n The past is all behind me\n Buried in the snow\n Let it go  let it go\n Can't hold it back anymore\n Let it go  let it go\n Turn my back and slam the door\n And here I stand  and here I'll stay\n Let it go  let it go\n The cold never bothered me anyway\n Yeah  whoa\n Let it go yeah\n Na  na\n Here I stand\n Let it go  let it go  oh\n Let it go
