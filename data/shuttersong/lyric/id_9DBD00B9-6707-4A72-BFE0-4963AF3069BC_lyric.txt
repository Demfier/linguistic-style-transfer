I could start dreaming but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well
Pretend
I've been dreaming

straight from the heart
You said it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier

Coming straight from the heart
Ohh Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we could make another start
You know I'll never go

As long as I know

It's coming straight from the heart
I'll see you on the street some other time
and all our words will just fall out of line
While we're dreaming

Straight from the heart
Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we could make one more start
You know I'll never go

As long as I know

It's coming straight from the heart
INSTRUMENTAL

straight from the heart
Tell me we could make one more start
You know I'll never go
As long as i know

Give it to me now
straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
give it to me oh now
straight from the heart
you know i'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
