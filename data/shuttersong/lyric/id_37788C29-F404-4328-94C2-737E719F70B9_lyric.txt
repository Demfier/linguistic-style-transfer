Hey shady baby I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower you're the chosen one

Well you're left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand sleep
Towards his gun
Oooh

I tackle weeds just so the moon buggers nibble
My right hand grips on his Colt single-action army

Ooh no

Well you're left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand sleep
Towards his gun
Oooh

N E O O N G G Whiz girl you're the one for me

Though your man's bigger than I am
All my days he disagrees
Oh no
(Speak easy)

Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free

Hey shady baby I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower you're the chosen one

Well your left hand's free

Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
