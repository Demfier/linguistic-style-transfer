I heard a great voice out of heaven saying
Behold the tabernacle of God is with man.
He shall dwell within them, they shall be His people
and Almighty God will be with them.
He shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
There shall be no more death.
Neither sorrow nor crying, and no more pain
the former things have all past away.
He that sat upon the throne said
Behold, I make all things new.
He said unto me, Write these words
for they are faithful and true.
And it is done, it is done, it is done, it is done.
He is the Alpha and Omega
the Beginning and the End.
The Son of God, King of Kings
Lord of Lords, He's everything.
Messiah, Jehovah, The Prince of Peace, is He.
Son of Man, Seed of Abraham
Second Person in the Trinity.
He is the Alpha and Omega
the Beginning and the End.
