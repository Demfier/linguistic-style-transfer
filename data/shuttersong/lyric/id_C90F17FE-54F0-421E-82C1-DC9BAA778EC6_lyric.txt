I wish I knew why the clouds above us so beautiful
And I wish that i knew why they create pictures for me and you
It's a miracle for us to share
White and grey patterns up in the air
I could daydream and look at the sky forever

Can't you see that it's a beautiful world
Come with me, I'll show you
Open your eyes and see the beauty around
Take my hand, and I'll lead you
It's so wonderful, so magical

Just see other day
I saw an angel and a polar bear
playing games in the sky
I saw a king sat in a great big chair
If you look at the clouds everyway
and they tell us a story each day
and they don't make us sad but does share together

Cant you see that it's a beautiful world
Come with me, I'll show you
Open your eyes and see the beauty around
Take my hand, and I'll lead you
It's so wonderful, so magical
It's so wonderful, so magical

Beautiful...
Beautiful...
Beautiful World...

Cant you see that it's a beautiful world
Come with me, I'll show you
Open your eyes and see the beauty around
Take my hand, and I'll lead you
It's so wonderful, so magical
It's so wonderful, so magical
It's a beautiful world...
