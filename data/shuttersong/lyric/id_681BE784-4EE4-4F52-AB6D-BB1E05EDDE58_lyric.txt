Its better if we dont speak at all, at all, at all
Its better if we dont speak at all, at all, at all, at all

Now deep down inside you
Know it cuts like a knife
But im too proud to show it
Pain in my chest (it feels)
Like i lost my breath
She just doesnt know it
So many things that im dying to say
But i cant seem to tell her

Its killing me, to know that she wants to leave
But im not gonna beg her to stay (no)
Cause i got my pride, im not gonna cry
There wont be no tears falling from these eyes
Dont need her to see
That its killing me
So this is what im saying

You dont have to worry about me
Boy, i'll be fine
You dont have to call me again
Boy, its alright
You dont have to ask me if i'll be okay
Boy, i'll be fine
Boy, i'll be fine

You aint got to tell me that we can still be friends
You aint gotta make no excuses and pretend
Cause i'll be fine, said i'll be fine
There no need to call

Its better if we dont speak at all, at all, at all
Its better if we dont speak at all, at all, at all, at all

I cant believe, that i fell so deep
And i let my heart so open
Now i gotta try, to keep it inside
These words, are better left unspoken

Cause i still got my pride, im not gonna cry
There wont be no tears fallling from these eyes
Dont need her to see
That its killing me
So this is what im saying

You dont have to worry about me
Boy, i'll be fine
You dont have to call me again
Boy, its alright
You dont have to ask me if i'll be okay
Boy, i'll be fine
Boy, i'll be fine

You aint got to tell me the we can still be friends
You aint gotta make no excuses and pretend
Cause i'll be fine, said i'll be fine
Theres no need to call
Its better if we dont speak at all, at all, at all
Its better if we dont speak at all, at all, at all, at all
Girl i'll be fine (said i'll be fine)
Theres no need to call
Its better if we dont speak at all
