i am praying for the answers to these questions
sleepless nights go on and on
i feel like i'm running away from the truth
ignoring everything i know and everyone oh everyone i love
i was just a boy i didn't know any better
my thoughts and my future and all its demons
in life now search for constant reasons
to get out of my bed and listen to the voice inside my head
trying to tell me to cope with all these different standards
playing life to please the crowd
it's hard when there's too much to handle
hope to turn this life around
in light you will find me hold on tight through the night i am yours
take me back home safely i'll go back to my bed with these thoughts of anger confused and spinning round my head
you know it's true to think i get it
i'm not the man that you intended
round and round it's plain to see the road i'm on is killing me
cope with all these different standards
playing life to please the crowd
it's hard when there's too much to handle
hope to turn this life around
in light you will find me hold on tight through the night i am yours
in light you will find me hold on tight through the night i am yours
(in light you will find me hold on tight through the night i am yours)
i am yours
in light (ohhh) you will find me hold on tight (hold on tight) through the night i am yours
in light (you'll find) you will find me hold on tight (hold on tight) through the night i am yours
in light you will find me hold on tight (hold on tight) through the night i am yours
