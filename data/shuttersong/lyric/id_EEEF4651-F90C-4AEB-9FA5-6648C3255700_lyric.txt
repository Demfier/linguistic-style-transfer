Caught you at midnight
Not in my right mind
What you're afraid of
Is where I just came from

An ugly confession
I think that I'm broken
When I try to be open

You think you can meet me
Alone on the side street
There's darkness between us
The moon is a witness

i'm learning a lesson
when it's out on the table
there's no change in people

Ever since you've been my ace of hearts
Hit me like a freight train in the dark
Come on baby take me far away
I wanna get so lost in the great escape

We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
