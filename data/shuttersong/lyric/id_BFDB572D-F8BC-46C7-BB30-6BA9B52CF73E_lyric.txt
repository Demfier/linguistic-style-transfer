Just say the word if you wanna go
go and fall in love with someone else
Go on and find someone better
who can keep you warm
who can give you more

yeah

We both know its not enough

If all that we are is two matching scars
lines in our movie
The same favorite song we both sing along
Then i don't wanna be in love

e eh

no I don't wanna be in love

e eh

yeah

fall asleep in the shadows of something beautiful
till its not enough
I only see you in black and white
like a photograph of another lie

If all that we are is two matching scars
lines in our movie
The same favorite song we both sing along
Then I don't wanna be in love

eh eh

No I don't wanna be in love

eh eh

yeah

I'd rather be alone than build a broken home
then hold it on to you like
I could never let you go
Say what you wanna say
Show what you never show
Let's be honest here and say what we already know
Your heart is somewhere else
It's not like i couldn't tell
Can't give you all my love when i don't even love myself
Trapped in each other's arms
We got the best of us
We keep each other warm
but we both know it's not enough

If all that we are is two matching scars
lines in a movie
The same favorite song we both sing along
Then i don't wanna be in love

eh eh

No I don't wanna be in love

eh eh

yeah
