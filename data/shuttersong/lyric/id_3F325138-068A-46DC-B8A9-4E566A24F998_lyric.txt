Oh, written in the stars a million miles away
A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way

Let's go, yeah, you're listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fucking hits than a disciplined child

So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with the racket and bat

Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk, so down to earth, I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed

Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at? Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Oh, written in the stars a million miles away
A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way

Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate we never tip
'Cause we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray

They say the money is the route to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave 'em amazed, great

It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man

I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming 'til they hear you out
Oh, written in the stars a million miles away
A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way
Ishi, Eric Turner, let's go
Oh, written in the stars a million miles away
A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way
