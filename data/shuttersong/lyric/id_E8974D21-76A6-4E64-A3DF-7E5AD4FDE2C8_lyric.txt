Love Me - The 1975
Written by£ºGeorge Daniel/Matthew Healy
Hey would you like to look outside sometimes no
I'm just with my friends online and there's things we'd like to change
Next thing you'll find you're reading about yourself on a plane fame
What a shame oh
Well just keep looking looking looking looking
And love me yeah
If that's what you wanna do oh yeah
And love me yeah
If that's what you wanna do oh yeah
You've been reading about yourself on a plane fame for a change
Caught up in fashion karcrashian panache and a bag of bash for passion
You've got a beautiful face but got nothing to say oh
You look famous let's be friends and portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like being
We've just come to represent a decline in the standards of what we accept
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
No
And love me yeah
If that's what you wanna do oh yeah
And love me yeah
If that's what you wanna do oh yeah
Oh so sack off your calendar give it to the people
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
Say oh oh oh oh oh
And love me yeah
And love me yeah
If that's what you wanna do oh yeah
