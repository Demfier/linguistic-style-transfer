You better watch out
You better not cry
Don't pout
I'm telling you why
I just came back from a lovely trip
Along the milky way
I stopped off at the north pole
To spend a holiday
I called on dear old santa claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plan to me
So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa claus is coming to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa claus is coming to town
Santa claus is coming to town
Look out crazy out soon
Said close got me to down
Right right there right here
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Claus santa is coming to town
Claus santa
Get ready now from go
Santa claus is coming to town
Don't pout
I'm telling you why
It's in the bag
Santa Claus Is Coming to Town - Ella Fitzgerald
