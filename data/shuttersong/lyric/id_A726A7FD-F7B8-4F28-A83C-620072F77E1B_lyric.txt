It's funny how
this bad taste in my mouth only lasts until I spit it out.
I was wasted
My mind was racing
All throughout our conversation.
Chris, it doesn't take too much.
Her face, it's quite enough.
The blood ran from her nose
As the blood ran from her nose
(oh, oh, oh)
What are we doing here?
(oh, oh, oh)
Cristina, please don't call here anymore.
Cristina, oh it's not me, it's you
Only did it because I wanted to.
It's funny how
This bad taste in my mouth
lasts until I forget about
how it feels to feel this way
Feels like just the other day
when we were kids
never thought it'd come to this.
Laugh, then we take a hit.
You look so criminal
I feel just like a criminal.
(oh, oh, oh)
(What the fuck am I doing here?)
(oh, oh, oh)
Cristina, please don't call here anymore.
Cristina, oh it's not me, it's you
Only did it because I wanted to.
I cannot wait to see your face
when you come crawling back to me
I cannot wait to see your face
when you come crawling back to me
I cannot wait to see your face
when you come crawling back to me
crawling back to me
oh, I cannot wait to see your face
when you come crawling back to me
crawling back to me
Cristina, please don't call here anymore.
(What are we doing here?)
Cristina, oh it's not me, it's you
Only did it because I wanted to.
