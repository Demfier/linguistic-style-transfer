Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
I took a car downtown and took what they offered me.

To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and they're standing in front of me.

My scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete.
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart

We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark.
We'll be glowing in the dark.

All the boys, all the girls
All the that madness in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs.
All the highs, all the lows
As the room is a-spinning goes
We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark.

So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark.
