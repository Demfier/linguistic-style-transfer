You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
Midnight
You come and pick me up
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
On this long drive
Could end in burning flames or
Paradise

I'll let you set the pace
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
I know exactly where it leads but I
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
What are you waiting for

I've got that James Dean daydream look in my eye
And you got that red lip classic thing that I like 
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
I've got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And you got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
We never go out of style
We never go
Out of

Stylin', wilin
Livin' in up in the city
I got chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty

What do you mean
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

Girls hit your hallelujah 
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah 
Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to ya
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to ya
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me just watch me whip

Watch me nae nae
Watch me whip, whip
Watch me nae nae, nae
Do the stanky leg
Do the stanky leg
Do the stanky leg

It's been a long day 
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it 
When I see you again
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
