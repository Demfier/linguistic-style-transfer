Wide eyed, with a heart made full of fright
Your eyes follow like traces in the night
The tightrope, that you wander everytime
you have been weighed
you have been found wanting

Been wondering for days
how you felt me slip your mind
leave behind your wanton ways

I wanna learn to love in kind

'Cause you were all I ever longed for
The shelter
you better keep the wolf back from the door
he wanders ever closer every night
and how he waits baying for blood
I promised you everything would be fine
Been wondering for days how you felt me slip your mind
leave behind your wanton ways
I wanna learn to love in kind

'Cause you were all I ever longed for

Hold my gaze love, you know I want to let it go
We will stare down at the wonder of it all

and I will hold you in it
and I will hold you in it

Been wondering for days
how you felt me slip your mind
leave behind your wanton ways
I wanna look you in the eye
'Cause you were all I ever longed for
Been wondering for days
how you felt me slip your mind
leave behind your wanting ways
I wanna learn to love and kinds.
You were all I ever longed for
