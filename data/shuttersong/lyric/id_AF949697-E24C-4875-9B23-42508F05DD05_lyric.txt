Jose in my glass like a real champ
Take it down  never chilled  like a real man
No chase face  looking like I'm real man
Fuck it if I get 'em too drunk  I don't feel bad
I just wanna get my rocks off
Champagne  shake it up  let it pop off
Spraying down the women that wear knockoffs
What you standing there for take your top off
Everybody getting crazy
In the party looking like Bey P
Get a friend  you can meet me in Brisbane
All aboard  cause we riding on this train
And we take it to the masses
Who got the good weed 
Fill up all the glasses
One more shot  indeed I be smashing
Get up on the bar  you're a star in a badmen
We got the Melbourne Bounce bounce bounce
We got the Melbourne Bounce bounce bounce
We got the Melbourne Bounce bounce bounce
We got the Melbourne Bounce
Awww  shit
Awww  shit
Awww  shit
Awww  shit
I go
On and on and on and
All up in the club  look like she want it
Back to my home  no I be on it
Loving it 'til the morning  oh yeah
Yes  I'm the best  at least yo that's what she said
We can have fun  baby then I'm leaving
But she asked cause she staying the weekend 
Trick no
Yo  use your head
Literally use your head
We can ruin the whole couch and abuse the bed
And doze off like it's Sudafed
It's me
Big to the N-A-B
Orkestrated and the place to be
We came here to rock the party
From Melbourne to NYC
Hey

We got the Melbourne Bounce bounce bounce
We got the Melbourne Bounce bounce bounce bounce
