Ay yo, the flyest muthafucka up in the room
Yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hating on him

'Cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house
On the couch watching cartoons

You know how much you love it
When you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion

But it's nothing when you stop
And just say, fuck it
'Cause you walking out in public
And you hear 'em talking rubbish

I just wanna ride
Ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch
Somewhere get my nuts kissed

That's the way it goes
When you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick
That used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world
When I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money
Ain't that some shit?

Take over the world
When I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money
Ain't that some shit?

We gonna take over the world
While these haters getting mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe

We gon' win
You can take the lose or draw
What I'm in, got these hoes
That used to play me and they broads

We gonna take over the world
While these haters getting mad
Take over the world
Watch these haters get mad

That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into to the car
Then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

And muthafuckas think they know me
But they never met the kids
Style come with excellence
And money make benevolence

Irrelevant for the fuckers
Who never been intelligent
I kill my Henney
Break the bottle for the hell of it

Tell a bitch
She better bring her friends
And if she want a autograph
She better bring a pen

Yeah, the party never ran
This life is what I recommend
And if you got a hope it for me
Then she better be a 10

I ain't picky
But these girls be acting tricky
When the situation's sticky
And the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world
When I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money
Ain't that some shit?
We gonna take over the world
While these haters getting mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gon' win
You can take the lose or draw
What I'm in, got these hoes
That used to play me and they broads
We gonna take over the world
While these haters getting mad
Take over the world
Watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into to the car
Then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
