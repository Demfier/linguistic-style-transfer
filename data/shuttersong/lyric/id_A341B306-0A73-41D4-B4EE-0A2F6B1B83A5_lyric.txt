You are just to young to find the
Senses in your life,
Looking for something else like the
Dream that you have.

Filled your life with something
Else like teardrop in your eyes
Who does care what you are while
The river flows in you?

You are not the fool, no,
You're a beautiful one,
You are like the sun,
Cause this one river flows in you.

You are not the no one,
You just look for more here,
Who does care because you are the one
With it inside.

You are not the fool, no,
You're a beautiful one,
You are like the sun,
Cause this one river flows in you.

You are not the no one,
You just look for more here,
Who does care because you are the one
With it inside.
