Everyday at twilight
When the sun turns red in the sky
I think of you on that shoreline
Brushing the hair from your eyes
We were drawing our names in the wet sand
And running away as the tide rolled in

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say out of sight means out of mind
But they couldn't be further from the truth
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you

Even if there is an ocean
Keeping your heart from mine
That doesn't mean I'm not thinking
About you all the time
I'm counting the days 'til I see you
And somewhere I know that you are too

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say out of sight means out of mind
But they couldn't be further from the truth
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you

La da da da oh

We had the summertime of our lives
Nothing has ever felt so right
The summertime of our lives
And even though, we had to say goodbye
I know when the water gets warm
You'll come back to me

Cause wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say out of sight means out of mind
But they couldn't be further from the truth

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that I won't give up on you
They say out of sight means out of mind
But they couldn't be further from the truth
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you
La da da da oh
I'm still in love with you
