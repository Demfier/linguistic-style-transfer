Cause we've been driving so long
I can't remember how we got here
Or how we survived
So long
I'm tryna run from our pride
Till you set fire to my atmosphere
And I remember I would spend the 23rd
Reeling 6 feet under
When I'm thirty thousand feet in the air
Chasing that sundown
So far east I'm westbound
Feeling like the edge of this world is near
You'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to god I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back
Someday
This is more than just a phase, love
Shooting stars will break up
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things will be better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I can fly you out this place
Someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on novacaine
Screaming through your airways
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them?
And they mean nothing to me
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you were one in a million
Anyway
Cause you see only what you want to
Your tunnel vision haunts you
And you can't see what's wrong when you keep sleeping through the beer
Eyes open when you're dreaming
Cause sleepwalking, just keep talking
Maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
No B plan in your system
Just tell me what you're thinking
I'm scared that you might fall, yeah
But you're not
But you're not
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Taking off your makeup
The sun always seem to wash our fears away
And it's always shining somewhere I just gotta get there
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things are better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
And maybe I can fly you out this place
Someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on novacaine
Screaming through your airways
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them?
And they mean nothing to me
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you were one in a million
You're so much better than that
You're so much better than that
You're so much better than that
Stay, you're not what you're hearing
Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you were one in a million
Anyway
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to god I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back
Someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on novacaine
Screaming through your airways
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say
You're so much better than that
