So wake me up
â€˜Cause I've been asleep now for days
How do I get up?
Oooo ooo
And a way back when
We used to fall hard in love how to mess it up
Oooo ooo
This ain't the end of us
Darling let me show you
I am good enough
Maybe In the end I should've toughened up
Not self-destruct
But I'll see her again

Met a girl and she is daaangerous
Dont quite know
But I just can't get enough
I'm stuck
She's gonna tear me up
A million voices telling me to never give you up
Shouldn't listen but I'm addicted to this darker love

And this is dangerous for me

I must confess
I'm feeling guilty
My conscience is heavy
I'm a wreck
Oooo ooo
This ain't the end of us
Darling let me show you
I'm not giving up
I tried to tell myself that I can toughen up

Not self-destruct
But I'll see her again

Met a girl and she is daaangerous
Dont quite know
But I just can't get enough
I'm stuck
She's gonna tear me up

A million voices telling me to never give you up
Shouldn't listen but I'm addicted to this darker love
And this is dangerous for me

Even though I said I'm sorry
I still go back
Always go back
Back to her
This ain't the end of us
Darling let me show you
I am good enough
Maybe In the end I should've toughened up
Met a girl and she is daaangerous
Dont quite know
But I just can't get enough
I'm stuck
She's gonna tear me up
A million voices telling me to never give you up
Shouldn't listen but I'm addicted to this darker love
And this is dangerous for me
