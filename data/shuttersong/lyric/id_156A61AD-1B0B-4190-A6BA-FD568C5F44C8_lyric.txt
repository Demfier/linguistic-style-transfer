La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la

I've been hypnotized
By bright red candy lips and angel eyes, yeah
I know that it ain't right
It's pleasure and it's pain
My hands are tied, yeah

I want her, everybody wants her
She knows it, eh eh eh
I want her, but I better run away
Oh, oh oh

She's so mean, but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her 'no'
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean, but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go

La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go

Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind

I want her everybody wants her
She knows it, eh eh eh
I want her, but I better run away
Oh oh oh

She's so mean, but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her 'no'
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean, but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go

La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go

Just one more time
Just one last time
She's so mean, but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go

I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her 'no'
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean, but I kinda love it
And i just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la, la la la
I just can't let her go
