How can I decide what's right?
When you're clouding up my mind?
I can't win your losing fight
All the time

How can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides?
But you won't take away my pride
No, not this time

Not this tiiimeee

How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
How did we get here?

Well, I think I knooow
(Music)
The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue

Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are?
If you're a man at all

Well, I will figure this one out
On my own
On my own

How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
Yeaah
How did we get here?

Well, I think I knooow
(Music)

Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves
(Music)
Yeaaaaaah...

How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
Yeaah, yeaah, yeah
Well, how did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so weeell?
I think I know
I think I know here is something
I see in you
It might kill me
I want it to be true
(Music)
