We will have love, we will have pain
There will be days and days and days that feel the same
We will have fear, we will have joy
And maybe little girls and little boys

We will have friends, we will have peace
There will be nights of lights and music 'til you sleep
We will be strong, we will still break
We'll live through so much more than we can take

Amen Amen
With the dawn, we all begin again
Amen Amen
What is done, and yet to come
Amen

We will have hope, we will have doubt
There will be memories we could never live without
We will have tears, but there will be grace
There will be prayers that we never thought we'd pray

Amen Amen
With the dawn, we all begin again
Amen Amen
What is done, and yet to come
Amen

In the sun or the storms, the flood or the flames
Let everything come, and I'm the one to blame
In heartache or hope I swear I'll say, I'll say

Amen Amen
With the dawn, we all begin again
Amen Amen
What is done, and yet to come
Amen
