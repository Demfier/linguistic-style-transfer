scratch the game plan
i'm going in again
spend all my time chasing girls i never see again
i put in so much effort, get nothing in return
i let my heart break
and i let the feeling burn
i let it fly away and try to write it out
and maybe learn something before i hit the ground
maybe i'll find a way
to keep from falling hard
but it don't matter to me
and i don't care so...
if you wanna ride just say so
and oh, we'll ride this roller coaster of emotions
this roller coaster of emotions
and if you wanna ride just say so
and oh, we'll ride this roller coaster of emotions
this roller coaster of emotions
and maybe it will all be worth it in the end
...
don't like to solve my problems,
it's just a waste of time
every time i think i got it nothing falls in line
life just shows me up
its got its own routine
my plans are changing and changing
and i can't miss a beat
but it's not up to me, fate is tough to read
all the pages turning, it never feels complete
maybe i'll find a way to slow the time down
but it don't matter to me and i try to change it but
if you wanna ride just say so
and oh, we'll ride this roller coaster of emotions
this roller coaster of emotions
and if you wanna ride just say so
and oh, we'll ride this roller coaster of emotions
this roller coaster of emotions
and maybe it will all be worth it in the end
...
so imma fall in love with every girl i see
instead of 'how?' and 'why?'
looking at what's in front of me
im gonna take a breath and leave my feels behind
don't see the point in stressing
when often sealing time
so when it comes to love
let it come to you
nothing wrong with searching
see where it leads you to
but just remember that no matter what you find
life's a roller coaster and you just gotta ride
if you wanna ride just say so
and oh, we'll ride this roller coaster of emotions
this roller coaster of emotions
and i you wanna ride just say so
and oh, we'll ride this roller coaster of emotions
this roller coaster of emotions
and maybe it will all be worth it in the end
