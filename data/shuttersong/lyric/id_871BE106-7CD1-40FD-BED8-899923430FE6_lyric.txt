Control
Control
Show me
You're not in control
Show me
Control, show it
You're not what you wanna take
You're not in control
Control
Show me
Control

Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight

Control, show me
Take control, show me
Show me control
You're not what you wanna look

You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on

Show me, show me, show me, show me all I ever want
Control
Show me, show me, show me all I... What you want

All we're fighting by the thought of losing out your beat alone
Won't be the one who has to sleep without you
By the time I know I want my way I know that you you wanna take me home
Let it happen and you'll be the one to
Well take the time to comprimise, no backing down
Says who, nothing else will ever come between us
Leave you with nothing else to say
No use in telling me what to do
All this be the one that you know, you trust

Let me catch my breath
Hold me to your chest
Feel our hearts cut out
From the other side
Keep it close to you
Until the night is through
You stood in control
From the other side

You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
You and me will take control,
And with this time make it all on, control

Show me
Control, show me
Control, show me
You're not what you wanna take
Slow it down
Slow it down
