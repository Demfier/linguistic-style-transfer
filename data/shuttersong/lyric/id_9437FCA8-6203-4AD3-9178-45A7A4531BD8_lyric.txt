You used to talkin
you're sweet about the shit out of me
Now I turned off the radio
That I sure that you wore that

I hated before
Now I feel so comfortable

Now you are a superhero crap

An uninspired mess

Got me climbing up the walls

I needed more, I had to go

But here it comes again
I miss you like a phantom limb

Itching right under my skin
I don't need you but
I'm still craving
Here it comes again
I miss you like a phantom limb
Itching right under my skin
Kinda lost but I don't need saving
You kept checking on your phone
When we were alone
You have so much going on
But further I want to go
The more you thought about home
We were so impossible
So unheld with your teens
Like a prison to me
No related that at all
I needed more, I had to go
But here it comes again
I miss you like a phantom limb
Itching right under my skin
I don't need you but
I'm still craving
Here it comes again
I miss you like a phantom limb
Itching right under my skin
Kinda lost but I don't need saving
I don't need saving.
I don't need saving.
I don't need saving.
I don't need saving.

...
But here it comes again
I miss you like a phantom limb
Itching right under my skin
I don't need you but
I'm still craving
Here it comes again
I miss you like a phantom limb
Itching right under my skin
Kinda lost but I don't need saving
Here it comes again
I miss you like a phantom limb
Itching right under my skin
Kinda lost but I don't need saving
I don't need saving.
