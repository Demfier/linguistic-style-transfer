The Neverending Sigh - Foo Fighters\n 
Woe is me\n The end is near thought you'd never leave\n Heart and teeth\n Just a taste bittersweet\n One last stain to get beneath the skin\n Beneath the skin\n The wish is drawn inside\n The Neverending Sigh\n No one let's everyone in\n No one let's everyone in\n My exit no exit\n No one let's everyone in\n Me and you\n Draw the line now it's time to move\n Face to face\n Damn the luck bless it be\n Heaven what's come over me\n The wish is drawn inside\n The Neverending Sigh\n No one let's everyone in\n No one let's everyone in\n My exit no exit\n Go on let everyone in\n No one let's everyone in\n In In In\n No one let's everyone in\n No one let's everyone in\n My exit no exit\n Go on let everyone in\n No one let's everyone in\n In In In
