Just the Way You Are - Bruno Mars\n Oh her eyes  her eyes\n Make the stars look like they're not shining\n Her hair  her hair\n Falls perfectly without her trying\n She's so beautiful\n And I tell her every day\n Yeah I know  I know\n When I compliment her\n She won't believe me\n And it's so  it's so\n Sad to think she don't see what I see\n But every time she asks me do I look okay\n I say\n When I see your face\n There's not a thing that I would change\n Cause you're amazing\n Just the way you are\n And when you smile\n The whole world stops and stares for a while\n 'Cause girl  you're amazing\n Just the way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n The way you are\n 'Cause you're amazing\n Just the way you are\n When I see your face\n There's not a thing that I would change\n 'Cause girl you're amazing\n Just the way you are\n And when you smile \n The whole world stops and stares for awhile\n Cause girl you're amazing\n Just the way you are
