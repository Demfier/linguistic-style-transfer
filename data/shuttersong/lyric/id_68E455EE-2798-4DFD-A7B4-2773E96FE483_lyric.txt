I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All along
Smoking his last cigarette
I said where've you been
He said ask anything
Where were you
When everything was falling apart
All my days spent by the telephone
And all I needed was a call
It never came
To the corner of First and Amistad
Lost and insecure you found me you found me
Lying on the floor surrounded surrounded
Why'd you have to wait
Where were you Where were you
Just a little late
You found me you found me
But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am Who I'm not Who I want to be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me
Lost and insecure you found me you found me
Lying on the floor surrounded surrounded
Why'd you have to wait
Where were you Where were you
Just a little late
You found me you found me
Early morning city breaks
I've been calling for years and years and years and years
You never left me no messages;
You never send me no letters;
You got some kind of nerve taking all of our love
Lost and insecure you found me you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you Where were you
Lost and insecure you found me you found me
Lying on the floor surrounded surrounded
Why'd you have to wait
Where were you Where were you
Just a little late
You found me you found me
Why'd you have to wait
To find me
To find me
