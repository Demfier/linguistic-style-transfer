H-m-m...
H-m-m...
Say what am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?

Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
(ooh...) When a female fires back
(ooh-ooh-ooh...) Suddenly the target don't know how to act

(ooh...) So he does what any little boy would do
(ooh...) Makin' up a few false rumors or two
(ooh...) That for sure is not a man to me
(ooh...) It's slanderin' names for popularity

(ooh...) It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
(it's so sad)
(ooh...) But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say
This is for my girls all around the world
Around the world

Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Oh-oh ooh
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
Oh... oh

What do we do girls?
(shout louder)
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
Stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Oh... ooh
Take a deep breath and say it loud
W-h-o-a

Never can never will
Can't hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Never can never will
So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'

Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
(ooh...) If you look back in history
(ooh-ooh-ooh...) It's a common double standard of society

(ooh...)The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
(ooh...) While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
(ooh...) I don't understand why it's ok
(ooh...) The guy can get away with it the girl gets named
(ooh...) All my ladies come together and make it change
Start a new beginning for us everybody sang

This is for my girls all around the world
'Round the world (yeah)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(can't get rid of us)

(we're standing our ground)
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud

Oh-oh ooh
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can never will
Can't hold us down (check)
Here's something I just can't understand

If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head or sex her off
But if a girl do the same she's a whore
But the tables about to turn I bet my fame on it

Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's aight though you can't hold me down (hold me)
I got to keep on moving
To my girls to their man who be trying to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that

You need to let him know that his game is whack
And LiL' Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back
Your just a little boy think you're so cute so coy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things

You're just a little boy all you do is annoy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things
(This is for my girls) this is for my girls all around the world
Oh-oh
