Lost in the cracks of the landslide
You saw me slipping on my blind side
I'm feeling lost, feeling tongue-tied
And now I'm frozen in your headlights

Deep in the haze of your love high
I used to soar on the live wire
I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking
All around
Oh, you let me down and
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Shot through the cracks of the earthquake
My body's moving into retrograde
I'm feeling loose, feeling untamed...
And you're the dynamite in my chains

Deep in the trench of the crossfire
You shot me down from the live wire
Tossed to the loss in your love game
You beat me cheating, and now I can't play

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking
All around
Oh, you let me down and
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Hit the ground running up from you
Baby you know I don't want to, no I want you
But there's nothing left to say
Lost in the riddle you gave me
Caught in the middle, you played me; see so plainly
But there's nothing left to say...
I should've known
I should've known

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking
All around
Oh, you let me down and
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
