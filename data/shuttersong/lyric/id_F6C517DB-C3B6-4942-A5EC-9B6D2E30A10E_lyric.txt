Speakers in the ceiling (speakers in the ceiling)
Marble on the floor (marble on the floor)
Half of me is happy (half of me is good)
But half of me wants more (half of me wants more)
Half of me wants more.
So I leave my keys on the counter
and I take the long way home
If love is like the sunset (if love goes down)
then it's been dark for so long
it's been dark here for so long
for so long
for so long
for so long

Pacifico
Shadows in the ceiling
chasing me all night
Half of me is ready
Half of me needs time
So I leave my keys on the counter
and I take the long way home
If love is like the sunset
then it's been dark for so long
it's been dark here for so long
for so long
for so long
for so long
for so long

Pacifico
In another life, in another dream
it would be, baby, with you right here
In another love, in another world
It would be the two of us, move now girl.
You know, that's how it goes
been dark here for so long
for so long
