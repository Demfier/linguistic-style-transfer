You looked at me with certainty.
I couldn't look away.
Took your jacket off like
Like you were here to stay.
Chasin' your pretty thoughts
And your plastic love.
There goes my mind
Let it go.

You're that lace trimmed danger
One day you'll be the face of a stranger.
Stranger.
Stranger.

I couldn't look away
Facin' your pretty thoughts.
You're mine
You're sinking' in my soul
chasin' your pretty thoughts.

I couldn't look away
Facin' your pretty thoughts.
You're mine
You're sinking' in my soul
chasin' your pretty thoughts.

Chasin' your pretty thoughts.

In intervals you're sinkin' in
You're sinkin' in my soul.
Thought to myself:
