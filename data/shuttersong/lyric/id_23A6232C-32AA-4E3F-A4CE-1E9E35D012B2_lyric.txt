I take a ride on a tiger's back
Cuz I'm
Rollerskatin' on a racin' track
And we
Hot and sticky like a pancake stack
We on fire
We on fire

Living life kaleidoscope cool
As I
Bungee jump into a jello pool
And we
Burnin' up like a mars attack
We on fire
We on fire

I ain't tryin' to impress nobody
But then I saw you
The way you movin' that body
You know just what to do
And it's been a really
Really long day girl
So I'm tellin' you in advance
I ain't in for any conversation
I'm just kidding

Oh yes, so
Last night I fell asleep with my shoes on
I woke up on the futon
Haven't had a crouton in about two months
Oh no
Front seat
Cruisin' down the street I'm an all black seat jeep
Yeah
You know life's alright
When reality is better
Than the dreams at night

You know life's alright
When reality is better
Than the dreams at night

I'm feelin'
So alive

I'm feelin'
So alive

Can't stop me
From watching
Got my eyes stuck on that body
Pushed up on and locked on
Feel so good

Can't stop me
From watching
Got my eyes stuck on that body
Pushed up on and locked on
Feel so good

Can't stop me
