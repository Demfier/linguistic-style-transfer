Don't Tell me you love me when I don't
You keep those words locked in a bottl
I am too young for that life style
I'm Mr. Casual
Our difference showed in our poisions
I live for long nights on the weekend
You knew the path when you walked it
Why can't you forget it?
Don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
I am a Hit and Run
Don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
I am a Hit and Run
I am a Hit and Run
Now I'm all alone, and I ain't got no one to call home baby
This is what I want, an empty bed with my shit so crazy
Ooh Ooh
Hit and Run
Baby
I'm all alone and I ain't got no one to call home, baby
This is what I want, an empty bed with my shit so crazy
Ooh sing Ooh
Hit and Run
Baby
So glad that you know where you're going
Life is so easily stomached
By actin on livin that fashion
Continuously find a new passion
I do what I do in the night time
Sorry but Babe it's my bloodline
You knew what I was when we did this
Why can't you forget it?
Don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
I am a Hit and Run
Don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
I am a Hit and Run
I am a Hit and Run
Now I'm all alone, and I ain't got no one to call home baby
This is what I want, an empty bed with my shit so crazy
Ooh Ooh
Hit and Run
Baby
I'm all alone and I ain't got no one to call home baby
This is what I want, an empty bed with my shit so crazy
Ooh sing Ooh
Hit and Run
Baby
(I am a Hit and Run)
(Don't call me... Don't call me... Don't call me...)
Now I'm all alone, and I ain't got no one to call home baby
This is what I want, an empty bed with my shit so crazy
Ooh sing Ooh
Hit and Run
Baby
I'm all alone and I ain't got no one to call home baby
This is what I want, an empty bed with my shit so crazy
Ooh Ooh
Hit and Run
