Hey what's up, it's been a while
Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up
While I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Know it's late but I'm so wired

Saw you facing God in spite
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh oh
This is probably' gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long

Oh oh
If we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body

He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Talkin' don't want me, cause I want you

Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh oh
This is probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long

Oh oh
If we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would
He won't touch you like I do
He won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would

Love you like I would, like I would
He, don't know. yeah
He yeah. (Touch you like I would)
He yeah. (Love you like I would)

He yeah. (He don't know, he don't know)
He, don't know your body!
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
He, can touch you like I would
(won't touch you like I do)
He, can love you like I do
(won't love you like I would)
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
