Question for the ages
What's going on with my rampages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm (come on)
It's the abstract Will is on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in the form of Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it be mindful of the speakers please
Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms, break the sound
Feel the embraceful pound
Treat all the things profound
If you wanna dude to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it could help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a

And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)

It's like that cause I got it like that
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Bosto
You know I'm known to cook a nigga like charcoal
Steady jumpin' round like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tanto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
Kobe showed the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on the door like we was Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't  that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke birds but I'm still real nice with the birds
So fuck £¨hey!£© what  you heard
Coz  we  got  it  like  that
Chorus]
Talib, just hit 'em  like  that
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I  got  it  like  that
Yo, my life  got me running through a maze  like a white rat
I need a shot at ramming  like my rap
 It's  like the yack is the fights  that  got me spillin' on the right track
And I  like this will so I might get ill
On the mikes somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after  you
 You be running  like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There  we yattin'  that ain't pretty  that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a too
Stare into the Sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because  you gotta watch me
Sneak up on  you  like saki
My lyrics get out a split atom  like Hiroshima and Nagasaki
 It's the Apl.De.Ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how  we act,  we attack any track
 It's the Black Eyed Peas and  we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills  that rose in the past
 We  got  it  like how  you  know how to beast rocks
Entertain  you, see  you soon at the next spot
The crew  got  you bouncing and dropping your eye
