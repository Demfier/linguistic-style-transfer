You want a love, a love for us
You want a selfless love
That we can always say we trust, oh
Love has always been a mockery
A vision of those scared to be near

Don’t wanna love, don’t wanna hurt
If all that loneliness requires
Just another’s comfort
Better off being alone on the road
Cause the beauty in being alone

Someday we’ll all agree, it’s not worth making
Another person that is yours for the taking
Or you’re hoping you’re praying
We’ll do more than saying that

Love, love, love, love is just greed
It’s almost taking me
And now I can see
Love, love, love, love is just greed
It’s selfish and mean
It follows all you lead
Is we really love ourselves, or you love somebody else

A love to us, a love to them
It’s just a history of beauty
In self time and time again
Love is not as it’s to hide your voice
All this talk of love just turns to noise

Say you want love, a love so tough
But even all this truth don’t seem
As though they’re adding up, oh
Haven’t you already had enough
Was this suffering remind you of?

Someday we’ll all agree, it’s not worth making
Another person that is yours for the taking
Or you’re hoping you’re praying
We’ll do more than saying that

Love, love, love, love is just greed
It’s almost taking me
And now I can see
Love, love, love, love is just greed
It’s selfish and mean
It follows all you lead
Is we really love ourselves, or you love somebody else

Love all gone is just another story
Of what’s gone sour once was glory, glory
Soon as you ... them
Honey could you put your arms around me slow
Tell me things about you that I wouldn’t know
And tell me that you love me like you do ...

Love, love, love, love is just greed
It’s almost taking me
And now I can see
Love, love, love, love is just greed
It’s selfish and mean
It follows all you lead
Is we really love ourselves, or you love somebody else.
