The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
of bumping into you
Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
and to my message, you replay...
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
High
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Somewhere darker
Tallking the same shite
I need a partner
Well, are you out tonight?
Gets harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisons and having bad ideas
Now its three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you replay...
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
High
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
And I can't see you here, wondering where am I?
Sorta feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said you gotta be up in the morning gonna have an early night. Then you started to bore me, baby Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high
