She only comes out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
she's sittin' with you
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think
You're gettin' for free
The woman is wild
A she-cat tamed
By the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love

You ain't gonna get too far

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly man
And she could really rip your world apart

Mind over matter
a beauty is there
But the beast is in the heart

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)

Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
watch out boy
she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater (she's a maneater)
(Uwoau ooooh)
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
watch out boy
she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
she's a maneater (she's a maneater)
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maaaneater
