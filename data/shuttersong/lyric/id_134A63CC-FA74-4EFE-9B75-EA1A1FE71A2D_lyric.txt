Fallingforyou - The 1975\n What time you coming down \n We started losing light \n I'll never make it right\n If you don't want me around \n I'm so excited for the night \n All we need's my bike and your enormous house\n You said some day we might\n When I'm closer to your height\n 'Til then we'll knock around  endlessly\n You're all I need\n Don't you see me now \n I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you \n Don't you need me \n I  I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you \n And on this night and in this light \n I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you\n Maybe you'll change your mind\n I think I'm falling  I think I'm falling\n I'm caught on your coat again\n You said  "Oh  no  it's fine "\n I read between the lines\n And touched your leg again  again\n I'll take you one day at a time \n Soon you will be mine \n Oh but I want you now (I want you now)\n When the smoke is in your eyes \n You look so alive \n Do you fancy sitting down with me  Maybe \n You're all I need\n According to your heart \n My place is not deliberate \n Feeling of your arms\n I don't wanna be your friend \n I wanna kiss your neck\n Don't you see me \n I  I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you\n Don't you need me \n I  I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you\n And on this night and in this light\n I think I'm falling  I'm falling for you\n Maybe you'll change your mind
