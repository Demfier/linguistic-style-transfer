No, no no no no. No, no no no no. No, no no no no.
On the daydream.
No, oh no. No, oh no.

The only risk is that you'll go insane.
The only risk is that you'll go insane.

This is a calamity,
this is some insanity.
This ain't why I make the records for,
what I reckon for.
Girl got a friend,
And I think we would be checking her.
The way that we be staring while our eyes be undressing her.
We should be finessing her,
we should be molesting her,
instead of walking round
oh tents with our pressure up.

My momma say the sin is,
God won't be blessing her.
Everything about my molecular is secular.
I be like to feel that,
baby you should feel this.
I can't do this square life,
baby it's the weirdest.
Sex, drugs, rap and roll,
this is my philosophy.
Anything other than is livid and hypocrisy.
So if you feel do good,
baby I'ma do wood.
Put that on my blood in my vein,
no sewer.

Did we do it? Yes.
Was it fresh? Yes.
We achieved higher through desires of the flesh.

Go insane.
Go insane.
