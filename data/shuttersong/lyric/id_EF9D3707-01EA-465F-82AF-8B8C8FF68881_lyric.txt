Thomas said stay home
Get away from me
Saying I was bad for you
He got his way
I'm gone for good.
Making up stories
Keeping it secret
Taking your word for truth
You were bad for me
So I'm gone for good.

I
Did all I could
So kiss this one more time 'cause
I'm gone for good
You
Misunderstood
So kiss this one last time and

I'm gone for good.

Thomas said sorry
Coming home crawling
Didn't give a shit before
He stole from me
So I'm gone for good
Getting back from this, no second chances
Another phone call ignored

You are back for me
But I'm gone for good.

I
Did all I could
So kiss this one more time 'cause
I'm gone for good
You

Misunderstood
So kiss this one last time and
I'm gone for good.

Can I get a little
Ah ah ah a-h
Ah ah ah a-h
Ah ah ah a-h
Kiss this

Ah ah ah a-o
Ah ah ah a-o
Ah ah a-o-h
Kiss this.

Kiss this
I
Did all I could
So kiss this one more time
One more time!
I
Did all I could
So kiss this one more time 'cause

I'm gone for good
You
Misunderstood
So kiss this one last time and
I'm gone for good.
Can I get a little
Ah ah ah a-h
Ah ah ah a-h
Ah ah ah a-h
Kiss this
Ah ah ah a-o
Ah ah ah a-o
Ah ah a-o-h
Kiss this
Kiss this.
