Stitches - Shawn Mendes\n Written by£ºDaniel Kyriakides\n I thought that I've been hurt before\n But no one's ever left me quite this sore\n Your words cut deeper than a knife\n Now I need someone to breathe me back to life\n Got a feeing that I'm going under\n But I know that I'll make it out alive\n If I quit calling you my lover\n Move on\n You watch me bleed until I can't breathe  shaking\n Falling onto my knees\n And now that I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches\n Tripping over myself  aching\n Begging you to come help\n And now that I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches\n Just like a moth drawn to a flame\n Oh  you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain\n Your bitter heart  cold to the touch\n Now I'm gonna reap what I sow\n I'm left seeing red on my own\n Got a feeing that I'm going under\n But I know that I'll make it out alive\n If I quit calling you my lover\n Move on\n You watch me bleed until I can't breathe  shaking\n Falling onto my knees\n And now that I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches\n Tripping over myself  aching\n Begging you to come help\n And now that I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches\n Needle and the thread\n Gotta get you out of my head\n Needle and the thread\n Gonna wind up dead\n Needle and the thread\n Gotta get you out of my head\n Needle and the thread\n Gonna wind up dead\n Needle and the thread\n Gotta get you out of my head\n Needle and the thread\n Gonna wind up dead\n Needle and the thread\n Gotta get you out of my head  get you out of my head\n You watch me bleed until I can't breathe  shaking\n Falling onto my knees\n And now that I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches\n Tripping over myself  aching\n Begging you to come help\n And now that I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches\n Now I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches\n Now that I'm without your kisses\n I'll be needing stitches
