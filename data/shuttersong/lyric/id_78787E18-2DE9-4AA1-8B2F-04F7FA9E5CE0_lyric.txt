From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
Oh this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Yeah, see as I lay here and get lost into those eyes
Can't deny my feelings for your being, they run deep inside
And we both know our hunger for some lust is all that's appetized
No ties is how it's advertised
I'd say we love these moments, but that's half a lie
Damn, you're trying to figure me out
And in your eyes I see the pain and fear that turns into doubt
Yeah you find peace inside your mind as we lay here on this couch
And that's even though you know this moment may not last past now
It's not fair, you're in my ear, \
