You clean AM you take me down and what you want is what
I love the colors of the world that lead me home tonight
One, two, too many times you tend to trick me up
Now that I know it’s all you want,
It’s still never enough

Calling on the backlines
Crawling from the battle to the other side
If courage is a lot lighter
I see it in your eyes

Too many plays and they know how to keep a choke on you
But you've got power-pressure, when I have too much to lose
The stakes are high, my mind is twisted, and the pressure’s off
At 4 o’clock we went ahead more dizzy than a flood

Calling on the backlines
Crawling for the battle to the other side
The courage a lot lighter
I see it in your eyes
Running from the battle to the other side
If freedom isn’t hard-wired
I see it in your eyes

Calling on the backlines
Crawling from the battle to the other side
If living isn’t hard wired,
I see it in your eyes

Crawling from the backlines
Hiding from the shadows that we left behind
Courage is a lot wider
I see it in your eyes
I See it in your eyes
I see it in your eyes
