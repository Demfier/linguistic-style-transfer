First day went out,
my heart stood still
I never had a man like you
and a doubt I ever will
Some I`m trying to play
in all these love games
Once you came into my life
I had a change,
yea

CHORUS
That`s why I`m so glad I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
Oh yea, I wanna be true I wanna be with you
Got a love for you
Cuz you`re special
Got a love for you
Listen to me babe
Got a love for you
How you feelin`
Got a love for you
I wanna be true

When youre lonely, Ill be there for you
Ill hug and kiss you all, and make you so much better
No other girl can make you feel the same
And I`m the way on you, I got a thing for you
I can`t explain
I`ll never ever leave you
You know I`m here to please you
Oh boy, wanna be true wanna be true

(chorus)

I remember the games that we used to play
And all the hearts we used to break
No one makes me feel the way you do
That`s why, baby, I`m gonna be true

Got a love for you
Got a love for you
Got a love for you
Got a love for you
Baby baby

Got a love for you
Got a love for you

Got a love got a love for you
Got a love for you
Oh, I got a love for you
Got a love for you, baby...
