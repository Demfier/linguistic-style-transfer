Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M. (yeah, yeah)

Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time

You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

We're just swimming around in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it (yeah, yeah)

Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreaming out loud
Trying to behave but you know that we never learned how
