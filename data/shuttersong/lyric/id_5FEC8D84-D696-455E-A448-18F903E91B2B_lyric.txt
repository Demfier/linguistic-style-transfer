Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - Wing$\n I was seven years old  when I got my first pair\n And I stepped outside\n And I was like  Momma  this air bubble right here  it's gonna make me fly\n I hit that court  and when I jumped  I jumped  I swear I got so high\n I touched the net  Mom I touched the net  this is the best day of my life\n Air Maxes were next\n That air bubble  that mesh\n The box  the smell  the stuffin  the tread  in school\n I was so cool\n I knew that I couldn't crease ¡®em\n My friends couldn't afford ¡®em\n Four stripes on their Adidas\n On the court I wasn't the best  but my kicks were like the pros\n Yo  I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo\n Nike Air Flight  but bad was so dope\n And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his fours  whoa\n See he just wanted a jump shot  but they wanted a Starter coat though\n Didn't wanna get caught  from Genesee Park to Othello\n You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings  with the velcro\n Those were not tight\n I was trying to fly without leaving the ground  cause I wanted to be like Mike  right\n Wanted to be him\n I wanted to be that guy  I wanted to touch the rim\n I wanted to be cool  and I wanted to fit in\n I wanted what he had  America  it begins\n I want to fly\n Can you take me far away\n Give me a star to reach for\n Tell me what it takes\n And I'll go so high\n I'll go so high\n My feet won't touch the ground\n Stitch my wings\n And pull the strings\n I bought these dreams\n That all fall down\n We want what we can't have  commodity makes us want it\n So expensive  damn  I just got to flaunt it\n Got to show ¡®em  so exclusive  this that new shit\n A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in\n Look at me  look at me  I'm a cool kid\n I'm an individual  yea  but I'm part of a movement\n My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it\n They told me to just do it  I listened to what that swoosh said\n Look at what that swoosh did\n See it consumed my thoughts\n Are you stupid  don't crease ¡®em  just leave ¡®em in that box\n Strangled by these laces  laces I can barely talk\n That's my air bubble and I'm lost  if it pops\n We are what we wear  we wear what we are\n But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all\n Will I stand for change  or stay in my box\n These Nikes help me define me  and I'm trying to take mine  off\n I want to fly\n Can you take me far away\n Give me a star to reach for\n Tell me what it takes\n And I'll go so high\n I'll go so high\n My feet won't touch the ground\n Stitch my wings\n And pull the strings\n I bought these dreams\n That all fall down\n They started out  with what I wear to school\n That first day  like these are what make you cool\n And this pair  this would be my parachute\n So much more than just a pair of shoes\n Nah  this is what I am\n What I wore  this is the source of my youth\n This dream that they sold to you\n For a hundred dollars and some change\n Consumption is in the veins\n And now I see it's just another pair of shoes
