[Kendall:]
I can feel it in the air
I like the truth but love the dare
Livin' life like it's a vacation

[Carlos:]
We are golden like the sun
Never, never land, we all stay young
'Cause we're the here and now generation

[All:]
Try and knock us down
We'll get up every time
We can run this town
So let's do what we like, do what we like

All day, every day is a holiday
We're alright, 24/Seven
All day, every day all we gotta say
Is live your life, 24/Seven
Woooooo wooooooo 24/Seven
Woooooo wooooooo 24/Seven

[Logan:]
We got no one to impress
Looking fly no matter how we dress
Standing up forever 'cause there is no end

[Carlos:]
It doesn't matter where you're from
We're all together here as one
Tomorrow comes, we'll do it all again

[All:]
Try and knock us down
We'll get up every time
We can run this town
So let's do what we like, do what we like

All day, every day is a holiday
We're alright, 24/seven
All day, every day all we gotta say
