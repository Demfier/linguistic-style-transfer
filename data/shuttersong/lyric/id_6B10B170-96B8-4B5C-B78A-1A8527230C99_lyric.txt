I woke up in the place we started
Your clothes on the floor in that old apartment
I never thought you'd leave without a trace
I can't shake this sinking feeling
I know you're not there and I'm barely breathing
Holding onto things I can't replace

I'm looking for a way to change my mind, don't walk away
Oh, tell me what we're fighting for

This turned into an all-out war
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
I'm trying to find our way back home
If it takes until we're skin and bones
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
Our lasts words ringing in my head
I wish we'd take back all the things we said
I'm trying to find a way to yesterday

Talking in circles and chasing our tails
And wondering why we created this wasteland
I wish it wouldn't be so cavalier
I'm looking for a way to change my mind, don't walk away
Oh, tell me what we're fighting for
This turned into an all-out war

I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
I'm trying to find our way back home

If it takes until we're skin and bones
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
Let go, let go
Fix these broken pieces and let go
We're fading out, we're all alone
It's what you wanted, I suppose
I can tell you feel the same
When you say you're looking for a way to change your mind and walk away
Oh, tell me what we're fighting for

This turned into an all-out war
We'll find a way to fix these broken pieces
Oh, tell me what we're fighting for
This turned into an all-out war
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
I'm trying to find our way back home
If it takes until we're skin and bones
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
Let go, let go
Fix these broken pieces and let go
