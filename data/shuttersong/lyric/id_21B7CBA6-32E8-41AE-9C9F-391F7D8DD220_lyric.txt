Stand up like a soldier baby
Yeah, I know you're built like that
Gun it like a holster baby
Show dem' seh' you wicked like that

We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we'll let it all go free

Gimme the thing and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the thing and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hotstep in a dance
Gimme the thing and make me rock

Gimme the thing and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the thing and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hotstep in a dance
Gimme the thing and make me light it up

Light it up...
Show them you're the flames to the fire
It's written like your name on a flyer
They wanna tame your desire
But you light it up now your aims getting higher
I dey wait for messiah
But until that day I'mma rise up high

I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere
1 by 1 let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel

3 by 3 for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbour
1 by 1 let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel

3 by 3 for my people
1 2 3 everybody go
Light it up...
Light it up...

Light it up...
1 by 1 let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel
3 by 3 for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbour
1 by 1 let me see you
2 by 2 for the sequel
3 by 3 for my people
Set it ablaze
Set it ablaze like a candle wick
hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
Yeah light it up
