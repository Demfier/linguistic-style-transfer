I'm halfway gone
we fought long enough
long enough
And we were holding ropes
but untied to love
untied to love sayin'
If we had a moment we could ignite
Instead it seems we're trying hard to start a fight
Along these streets you read my words in the night
You hear me call

Let me come home to you
let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Your smile still echoes through my head

Let me come home to you
let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Tell me would you let me in

Home again
Home again

I'm losing light
see me burning out
burning out
I guess all these nights will be lonely hours
lonely hours thinkin'
If we had a moment we could ignite
Instead it seems we're trying hard to start a fight
Along these streets you read my words in the night
You hear me call

Don't let me lose you too

Let me come home to you
let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Your smile still echoes through my head

Let me come home to you
let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Tell me would you let me in
Home again
Home again
