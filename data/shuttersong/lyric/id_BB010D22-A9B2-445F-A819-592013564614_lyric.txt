Sipping on this drink, have some time to think
About where I was, and where I'm at today
I'm getting everything I ask for
Flying the world, filling up my passport
I'm in the zone, martini's strong
my time is short, but my money long
I'm getting everything I ask for
in the club, always keep my glass full

Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want, but you
Imma get you one day, Imma get you one day
House on a hill, hollywood view, i got everything I want but you
I might get you one day, I might get you one day

Hey, everybody came to play
I love it when the dj
plays all my favourite songs
And everybody sings along
I see the pretty babies in the pool

But all I can think about is you

Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want, but you
I might get you one day, I might get you one day
House on a hill, hollywood view, i got everything I want but you
Imma get you one day, Imma get you one day

When I get you girl, you're gonna be so in love with me
Everyday, we're gonna play, what's your fantasy?
Every night I think of you in every way
And when it get you, imma celebrate
Imma celebrate! imma celebrate!
I'm gonna celebrate, cuz I'mma get you one day
