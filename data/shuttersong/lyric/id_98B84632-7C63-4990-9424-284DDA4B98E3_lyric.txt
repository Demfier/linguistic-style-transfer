Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on lets go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away-
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!-
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman.

Go away, Anna

Okay, bye...

Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to
the pictures on the walls-
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms,

Just watching the hours tick by-

Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there,
People are asking where you've been
They say \
