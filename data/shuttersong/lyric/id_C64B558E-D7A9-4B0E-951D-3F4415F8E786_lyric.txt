1:
Summer days
wishing off distance that kept me away,
don't stay low
Seeing uphill
get to the moving
don't be still
don't stay low

Summer nights
some are the best of them, others not quite
don't stay low
follow closely
hear what sits between your neck and your jeans
don't stay low

Oh leave your mistake in the doorway
give us a sign that you've seen what you've done
and look for the sun
and lift up your head
don't say low, don't stay low
no just pick yourself up and go on

2:
If you take
this battle on there'll be blood in your way
rattle on
just to say
if you shot out the legs, would you shatter the table
we run
you can stay low

Leave your mistake in the doorway
give us a sign that you've seen what you've done
and look for the sun
and lift up your head
don't say low, don't stay low
no just pick yourself
Oh
Leave your mistake in the doorway
give us a sign that you've seen what you've done
and look for the sun
and lift up your head
don't say low, don't stay low
no just pick yourself up and go on
