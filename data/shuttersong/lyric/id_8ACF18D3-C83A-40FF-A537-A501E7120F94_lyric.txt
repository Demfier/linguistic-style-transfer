Separated
and negated
it seems fated
we have to find out more.

do you want me?
tell me promptly
or just stop me
its you that i adore.

i can't wait for another second minute or hour
i can't wait it's all your choice it's in your power
i can't wait for another second minute or hour
i can't wait it's all your choice it's in your power.

i lost my head when i found my heart
but now with neither i've fallen all apart
with this voice and chord i'll tell you from the start
she never wanted me, she never wanted me.

i act stupid
due to cupid
my love's rooted
you'll have to dig down deep

mixed emotion
fixed devotion
your magic potion
you sprinkle as i sleep.

i can't wait for another second minute or hour
i can't wait it's all your choice it's in your power
i can't wait for another second minute or hour
i can't wait it's all your choice it's in your power.

i lost my head when i found my heart
but now with neither i've fallen all apart
with this voice and chord i'll tell you from the start
she never wanted me
she never wanted me
she never wanted me.

with you i can't imagine being alone
without you i can see how much i've grown
coz you made me what i am today
have you gave me all that i can take

i lost my head when i found my heart
but now with neither i've fallen all apart
with this voice and chord i'll tell you from the start
she never wanted me
she never wanted me
she never wanted me
she never wanted me
