Honey Bee - Madrugada
Honey bee come buzzing me
I ain't seen you for so long
I need to feel you
I mean to reel you
Like the one described to me in a song
Out in the woods
Tall pine tree woods
She gave sweet loving to me
Her woodland grace
Her soft embrace
My face in shadow   Honey bee
Won't you come see me in the morning
Won't you come see me late at night
For it ain't right   no   it  just ain't right
You're meant to turn away from the light
Night all my lights are on
I need a little one on one
This useless   helpless feeling
A young man should be blessed with love
There's just flesh and fire below
This drunken  senseless reeling
Hands on my face
Some silk and lace
Sweet perfume kisses for me
Wherever you burn
Ah   I have returned   you lucky lady honey bee
I have to leave you in the morning
You always wanted to be free
Stay with me
Sweet lucky lady
Don't ever leave me Honey bee
Awake in cold places
Cool ice and icy faces
Some dead and some living
Most of them doing something in between
My lady in waiting
Must have turn to hating me
Some bitter awakening this has been
But    the next time she calls I'm gonna let her in
The next time she calls I'm gonna let her in
And if she leaves me in the morning
At least we both have been relieved
Now   stay with me
Stay with me   sweet lucky lady
Don't you ever leave me     Honey bee
