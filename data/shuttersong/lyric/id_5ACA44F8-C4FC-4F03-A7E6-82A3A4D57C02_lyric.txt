Now put your hands up
Up in the club, just woke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cuz another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
cried my tears, three good years
Ya can't be mad at me
Cuz if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
I put gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
And we tighter than in my Dereon jeans
acting up, breaking my cup
I could care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
I don't care him any attention
Cuz you had your turn
But now you gonna learn
What it really feels to miss me
Cuz if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then yo
u should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't treat me like things of this world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I concern
He's a man that makes me and takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm not the one you own
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

Now put your hands up
Cuz if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
