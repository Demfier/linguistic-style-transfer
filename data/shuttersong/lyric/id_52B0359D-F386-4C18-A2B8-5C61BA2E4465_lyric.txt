I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up; you were falling down (down)
Mmm there's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I'm forgiving it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
Gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
Gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more


I'm giving you up
I'm forgiving it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
Gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
Gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, are you ready?
Gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, are you ready?
Gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
