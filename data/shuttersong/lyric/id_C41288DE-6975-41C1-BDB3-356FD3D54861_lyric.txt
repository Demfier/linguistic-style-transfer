 A risk can scare a thought away
Everyone's  a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
 Can you imagine in  a mirror
Watching yourself cry like  a baby
California
The blood orange season brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself, there's no end to grief
That's how I know
Whoa, that's how I know
And why I need to know
If there is no, if there is no end
To love
Whoa, oh, you know
And all I need to know is
There is no, yeah, there is no end
To love
Whoa, oh, you know
And all I need to know is
There is no, yeah, there is no end
To love
Whoa, we come and go
With stolen days you don't get back
Stolen days are just enough
