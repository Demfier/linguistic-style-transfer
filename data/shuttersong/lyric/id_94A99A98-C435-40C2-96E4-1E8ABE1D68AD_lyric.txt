Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd

His skin was pale and his eye was odd

He shaved the faces of gentlemen

Who never thereafter were heard of again

He trod a path that few have trod

Did Sweeney Todd

The demon barber of Fleet Street

He kept a shop in London Town

Of fancy clients and good renown

And what if none of their souls were saved?

They went to their maker impeccably shaved

By Sweeney

By Sweeney Todd

The demon barber of Fleet Street

Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!

Hold it to the skies!

Freely flows the blood of those who moralize!

His needs were few, his room was bare:

A lavabo and a fancy chair

A mug of suds and a leather strop

An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop

For neatness he deserved a nod

Did Sweeney Todd

The demon barber of Fleet Street.

Inconspicuous, Sweeney was

Quick and quiet and clean, he was

Back of his smile, under his word

Sweeney heard music that nobody heard

Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned

Like a perfect machine, he planned

Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle

Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!

Sweeney!

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd

He served a dark and a vengeful god

What happened then, well, that's the play

And he wouldn't want us to give it away

Not Sweeney

Not Sweeney Todd

The demon barber of Fleet Street
