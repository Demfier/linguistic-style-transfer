We painted our faces
We were at resting place in from the light
I must admit on that resting site
We looked alright

But now it's just traces
As we fade in black and white
We put make up on with no light
We're too uptight

(Too uptight, we're too uptight)
Color me this way
Color me that way
Color me inside out

Color me upside down
Color me this way
Color me that way
Color me inside out

Color me upside down
To show my true colors
I must first be exposed to the light
I trans first, then secondly fight

With all my might
I've blown my cover
In plain view I'm as plain as you
But you can't deny my hues

Red blue chartreuse
Color me this way
Color me that way
Color me inside out

Color me upside down
Color me this way
Color me that way
Color me inside out

Color me upside down
Color me this way
Color me that way
Color me inside out
Color me upside down
Color me this way
Color me that way
Color me inside out
Color me upside down
