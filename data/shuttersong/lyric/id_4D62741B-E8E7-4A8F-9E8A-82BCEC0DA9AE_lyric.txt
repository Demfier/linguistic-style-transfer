Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt

You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man

Never worry 'bout

(Deserves good things)
Fistful of diamonds
(Hand full of rings)

Baby, you're a star
(I just want to show you, you are)

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection

Make me your selection show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you, love you, yeah

You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare

From your head to your toes, out of control, baby you know
