Crowded hallways are the loneliest places
For outcasts and rebels
Or anyone who just dares to be different
And you've been trying for so long
To find out where your place is
But in their narrow minds
There's no room for anyone who just dares to do something different
Hmmm, but listen for a minute

Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was was sticks and stones
These words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone
You're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be
Invisible

Oh invisible

So your confidence is quiet
To them quiet looks like weakness
But you don't have to fight it
'Cause you're strong enough to win without a war
Oh, in every heart has a rhythm
So let yours beat out so loudly
That everyone can hear it
Yeah I promise you don't need to hide it anymore

Oh and never be afraid of doing something different
Dare to be something more

Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was was sticks and stones
These words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone
You're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now

And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be
Invisible

These labels that they give you is just cause they don't understand
If you look past this moment
You'll see you've got a friend

Waving a flag for who you are
And all you're gonna do
Yeah so here's to you
Here's to anyone whose ever felt invisible

Yeah
Yeah your not invisible
Hear me out, there's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be
Invisible
It'll be invisible
