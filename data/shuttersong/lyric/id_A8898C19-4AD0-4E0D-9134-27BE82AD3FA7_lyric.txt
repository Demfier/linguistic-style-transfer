Ev'rybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat
Who knows where it's at
Ev'rybody's pickin' up on that feline beat
'Cos ev'rything else is obsolete
A square with a horn
Makes you wish you weren't born
Ev'ry time he plays
With a square in the act
You can set music back
To the caveman days
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing
Still a cat's the only cat
Who knows how to swing
Who wants to dig a long-haired gig
Or stuff like that?
When ev'rybody wants to be a cat, meow!
Everybody
Wants to be a cat
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat
Who knows where it's at
While playing jazz you always have
A welcome mat
'Cos everybody digs a swinging cat
A square with a horn
Makes you wish you weren't born
Every time he plays
Oh, with a square in the act
You can set this music back
To the caveman days
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing
Still a cat's the only cat
Who knows how to swing
Who wants to dig a long-haired gig
Or stuff like that?
When everybody wants to be a cat, meow!
(Groovy cat!)
-Everybody wants to be a cat-
(Dimie Cat on the track) -Oooh-
-Everybody wants to be a cat-
-Everybody wants to be a cat-
-Everybody-
Everybody wants to be a cat
If you want to turn me on
Play your horn, don't spare the tone
And blow a little soul into the tune
Let's take it to another key
Modulate, and wait, for me
I'll take a few ad-libs
And pretty soon
The other cats will all commence
Congregating on the fence
Beneath the alley's only light
Where every note is out of sight...
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
(Hallelujah)
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
(Hallelujah)
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
(I'm telling you)
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
(Dimie Cat on the track)
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
