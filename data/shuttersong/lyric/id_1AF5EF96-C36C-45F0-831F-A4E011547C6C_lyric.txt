Where it began, I can't begin to know when

But then I know it's growing strong

was in the spring And spring became the summer

Who'd have believe you'd come along
Hands, touching hands, reaching out Touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline Good times never seem so good

I've been inclined to believe it never would... but now I...

...look at the night and it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two

And when I hurt Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when i'm holding you

warm,, touching warm,,,, reaching out
Touching me,,,, touching you
Sweet Caroline,, Good times never seem so good
I've been inclined,,, to believe they never would,,,, Oh No no
muziek
Sweet Caroline,, good times never seem so good
i'been inclined,,,, a believe The never would
