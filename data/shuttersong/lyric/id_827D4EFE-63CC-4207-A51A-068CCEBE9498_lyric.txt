You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies and people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

So in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

You look so beautiful in this light
You silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see

I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
So in love

So in love
So in love
So in love
Lumière, darling

Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Should this be the last thing I see

I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
So in love
So in love
So in love (love, love, love)
So in love
You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you, Beth
