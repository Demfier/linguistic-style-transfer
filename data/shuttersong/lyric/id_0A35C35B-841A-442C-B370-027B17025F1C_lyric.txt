O yeah

Last night i took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands places to go
seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa can you hear me?

I signed my letter that i sealed with a kiss
I sent it off and just said this
I know exactly what i want this year

Santa can you hear me?
I want my baby (baby baby)
i want someone to love me
and someone to hold
maybe, maybe (maybe maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

Santa can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
and all I want is one thing
tell me my true love is here
he's all I want just for me
underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa thats my only wish this year

O yeah
yeah

Christmas eve i just cant sleep

'Cause i heard that you're coming to town
Santa can you hear me?

I really hope that your on your way
with something special
for me in your sleigh
oh please make my wish come true

Santa can you hear me?
I want my baby (baby baby)
I want someone to love me
and someone to hold
Maybe maybe (maybe maybe)
We'll be all alone under the mistle toe
