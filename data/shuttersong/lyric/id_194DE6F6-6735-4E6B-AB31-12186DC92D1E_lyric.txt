Racing faster, escape disaster
Partners in crime will leave their mark
We make our own way, no thoughts of yesterday
Black hearts of chrome and battle scars

Woah, oh, oh, the legacy born from a dream
On leather wings rose from the streets
With the hand on destiny

We came from nothing but promise one thing
We'll change the world with these guitars
So listen closely and don't stop working
No one can tell you who you are

Woah, oh, oh, the legacy born from a dream
On leather wings rose from the streets
With the hand on destiny

The legacy born from a dream
On leather wings rose from the streets
With the hand on destiny

Go
Run
Run

Never look back
Run
Run
Never look back
Run
Run
Run
Nver look back
Run
The legacy born from a dream
On leather wings rose from the streets
With the hands on destiny
The legacy born from a dream
On leather wings rose from the streets
With the hand on destiny
