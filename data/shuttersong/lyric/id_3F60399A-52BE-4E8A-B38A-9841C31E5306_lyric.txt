Some people keep wondering
Some people run without knowing
Some people never found the answer
The answer

I am falling now into this dream
Let the music guiding me
'Cause now I feel everything for the first time

It's such a beautiful, beautiful life
When every day is made of you and I
Oh oh
Just close your eyes
And we could dance tonight forever
