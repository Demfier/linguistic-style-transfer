Stockings are hung with care, as children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake 'cause I'm older now
but not done hoping

The twinkling of the lights
as Santa carols fill the household
Old Saint Nick has taken flight with a heart on board
so please be careful

Each year I ask for many different things
but now I know what my heart wants you to bring

So please just fall in love with me, this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need, this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
so kiss me on this cold December night

A cheer that smells of pine, a house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line, loneliness is what I've captured
Oh that this evening can be a holy night
Let's cosy on up by the fireplace and dim those Christmas lights

So please just fall in love with me, this Christmas
There's nothing else that you will need, this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
so kiss me on this cold December night

They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours

Just fall in love with me, this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need, this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
'cause I don't wanna be alone tonight

I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
walk you proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something that lasts forever
so kiss me on this cold December night
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours
