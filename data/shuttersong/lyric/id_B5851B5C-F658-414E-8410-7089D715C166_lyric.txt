I had high hopes for us baby
Like I was on dope for us baby
Chasin' after a high that I'd never get back again
So we turn into three long years
And it became painfully clear that we
We would never see those days again
But I guess forever, doesn't last too long forever
Doesn't last too long forever
Doesn't last too long these days, hey
And I try to believe that we could make it
But trying don't work, so I just have to face that forever
Doesn't last too long these days, hey

Still think about the good times we had
And how you used to make me laugh
But baby I know most times we were miserable
So everytime I wanna call, baby what always helps
Is when I think of the pain, and I realize
I'm better off by myself

Cause forever, doesn't last too long forever
Doesn't last too long forever
Doesn't last too long these days, hey
And I try to believe that we could make it
But trying don't work, so I just have to face that forever
Doesn't last too long these days, hey

Lord knows I gave it my all and
I couldn't save us from falling
Cause some people aren't meant to be together forever forever

Cause forever, doesn't last too long forever
Doesn't last too long forever
Doesn't last too long these days, hey
And I try to believe that we could make it
But trying don't work, so I just have to face that forever
Doesn't last too long forever these days, hey
