Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my
Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream

Ev-ev-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my
Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream

 (I see my dream son)


Every time I dive in my pool
It's hard to be humble
When I do the breastroke through an underground tunnel
And come up on the other side in a jacuzzi
Being greeted by two naked models with suds on thay booties
They give me hugs and lots of kisses
And they ask me what my wish is
I say go and call your bitches
Cause there's gonna be a party
Next they wash my body as a team
And then the say "foo your royal penis is clean"
And I'm like


Yes it's on and poppin
Yes the partys rockin
Yes the cuties jockin
Yes and there ain't no stoppin



Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my
Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream

Ev-ev-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my
Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream


Wakin up next to a beautiful girl
Step outside and say hello to my beautiful world
Grandmas cookin breakfast she makes pancakes the best
I check my myspace and I got alotta friend requests YES
I get to dancin as I
Walk throungh my mansion cause I
Own property from california to the hamptons and I
Sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda
Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor opera huh
I check to see how my albums doin today
The group LMFAO goes double platnium heyyy
I gotta party man that's how I live
So I take my elevator to the club in my crib like


Yes it's on and poppin
Yes the partys rockin
Yes the cuties jockin
Yes and there ain't no stoppin



Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my
Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream

Ev-ev-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my
Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream
