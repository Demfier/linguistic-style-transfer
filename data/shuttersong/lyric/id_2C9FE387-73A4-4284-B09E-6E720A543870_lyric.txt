Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga
Real quick
They be on that
Rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit
Not even a little bit
Oh Lord know yourself
Know your worth nigga
My actions been louder
Than my words nigga
How you so high
But still so down to Earth nigga
If niggas wanna do it
We can do it on they turf nigga
Oh Lord I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here
Holdin' down the set
All up in my phone
Lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset
If she keep scrollin' to the left dawg
She gon' see some shit
That she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest
Then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly
But it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce
Chef curry with the pot boy
360 with the wrist boy
Who the fuck them niggas is boy
OVO man we really with the shits
Boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy
Cause I got all the hits boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV
I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough
I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement
Puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money
Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008
I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works
And now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio
Every night late night
Gotta watch that shit
Don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord
Got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it
We can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks
And the billis nigga
Don't make me
Kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit
They like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest run Forrest
Go Forrest"
Yeah I mean you already wrote for us
Damn nigga
What's one more quote for us
Oh Lord
Who else soundin' like this
They ain't make me what I am
They just found me like this
I was ready fuck that
I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas
And do it for myself
I go 0 to 100 nigga real quick
Real quick whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100 nigga real quick
Real quick real fuckin' quick nigga

Real quick real fuckin' quick nigga
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
The other night
Lavish Lee told me
That I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch
Another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you
You would be dissin' you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout
No way to soften that
Cause me
I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward
And they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor
Who do they call
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback
And provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit
No matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em
Before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these
Man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended
But they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it
Who meetin' me there
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy
But he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work
As well as bein' aware
Listen up boy
You're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin' Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin'
OB droppin' not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off
Man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it
Before Twitter names
Yeah been on the move
Like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person
That's keepin' up
Damn fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself how do we match up now
Cause I'm only 27
And I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet
Watch me catch up now for real
