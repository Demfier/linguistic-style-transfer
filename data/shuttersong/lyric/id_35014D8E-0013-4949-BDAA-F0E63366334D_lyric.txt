All the broken hearts in the world still beat
Let's not make it harder than it has to be
Oh, it's all the same thing
Girls chase boys chase girls

I'm a little let down but I'm not dead
There's a little bit more that has to be said
You play me, now I play you too
Let's just call it over

It's one to forgive but it's hard to forget
Don't call me, I won't call you too
Let's just call it over

And I'll be alright, I'm gonna be alright
