 I love to get you on
When the drink make  you strong
When treat be way too strong
 Get faded, turn up, real poet
All night, turn like  you even think no more
 Get ratchet, go dumb, then come  on dumb
We can keep it in, let's roll
(Let's roll)
 I  love  to (let's roll)
If we can  get active
And all, come bitches attracted
We go, we know who we are now
 Get high
Like bus in the car now
Just give me the trees
And we can smoke it ya
Just give me the drink
And we can pour it ya
And my enemies they see me living now
And if  you roll me
then  you'll be winning now
All night,
turn like  you even think no more
 Get ratchet, go dumb,
then come  on dumb
