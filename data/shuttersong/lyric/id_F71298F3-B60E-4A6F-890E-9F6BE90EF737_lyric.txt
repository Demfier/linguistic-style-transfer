I don’t know if you’re ready to go
Where I’m willing to take you girl 
I will feel every inch of your skin 
And you know I can rock your world 
Imma be the calm in the storm you’re looking for 
I’ll be the shipwreck that takes you down 
I don’t mind if you lie in my bed 
We can stay here forever now.
Ouuu oohhhhh

Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo 
Ouuu oohhhhh
Give up the fight 
I’m in control 
Why don’t you let it go.

Yeah, I wanna know you inside out 
I’ll spend my life trying to figure out 
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth 
And let me kiss you inside out.

I don’t care if you steal all my air
we can breath in together as one
it’s all right if you’re here every night
waking up with you in the sun
we start with an hour and we find we waste the day
kicking back with the love we found.
I don’t mind if you lie in my bed
we can stay here forever now
Ouuu oohhhhh

Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo 
Ouuu oohhhhh
Give up the fight 
I’m in control 
Why don’t you let it go

Yeah, I wanna know you inside out 
I’ll spend my life trying to figure out 
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth 
And let me kiss you inside out.

Let me love you, let me love you 
let me love you babe. 
let me love you, let me love you 
let me love you babe. 
let me love you, let me love you 
let me love you babe. 
let me love you, let me love you 
let me love you babe. 
I don’t mind if you lie in my bed
We can stay here forever now.
Ouuu oohhhhh
Turn off the lights
Take off your clothes
Turn on the stereo 
Ouuu oohhhhh
Give up the fight 
I’m in control 
Why don’t you let it go
Just let it go. 
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out 
I’ll spend my life trying to figure out 
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth 
And let me kiss you inside out.
I wanna know you inside out.
I’ll spend my life trying to figure out
Just close your eyes and shut your mouth 
And let me kiss you inside out.
