I'd cross a desert and an ocean
To get away from the pain of your storm
But chase the sun light, been running from your shadow
So that I could heal and I didn't breathe

That zig-zag shooting through my heart
That zig-zag hit me like a dart
Electricity, electricity
Oh, this love's tearing me apart
I been running like the light from the dark
Electricity keeps on hitting me

Oh lightning strikes twice
And it burns like ice
I wish I didn't love you again
Lightning strikes twice
And it burns so nice
I wish I didn't love you
(But I do)
(But I do)

Those eyes one look and I'm enchanted
Your voice a serenade, and it sings to my heart
One kiss, turned the skies to gray
I'll never get away, no shelter from the rain, no

That zig-zag shooting through my heart
That zig-zag hit me like a dart
Electricity, electricity
Oh, this love's tearing me apart
I been running like the light from the dark
Electricity keeps on hitting me

Oh lightning strikes twice
And it burns like ice
I wish I didn't love you again
Lightning strikes twice
And it burns so nice
I wish I didn't love you
(But I do)
(But I do)

O Fortuna
Velut luna
Statu variabilis
Semper crescis
Aut decrescis
Vita detestabilis

Every time that I hear your name, oh
Baby all the pleasure, the pain, oh

Lightning strikes twice
And it burns like ice
I wish I didn't love you again
(But I do)
(But I do)
O Fortuna
Velut luna
Statu variabilis
Semper crescis
Aut decrescis
Vita detestabilis
(But I do)
