I've had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

I've had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you
You, you, you…
Dirty bit

Dirty bit

I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots

So come on, let's go
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
Till we can't do it no more

People rocking to the sound
Turn it up, and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
Until the roof come burning down

Yeah, it's hot in here, the temperature
Has got these ladies getting freakier

I got freaky, freaky, baby
I was chilling with my ladies
I didn't come to get bougie
I came here to get crazy

I was born to get wild
That's my style
If you didn't know that
Well, baby, now you know, now

'Cause I'm having a good time with you
I'm telling you

I've had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

Oh, I've had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you
You, you, you…
Dirty bit

Dirty bit

All-all these girls, they like my swagger
They calling me Mick Jagger
I be rolling like a Stone
Jet-setter, jet-lagger

We ain't messing with no maggots
Messing with the baddest
Chicks in the club
Honey, what's up?

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Yeah, it's gotta be the Apl
I'm the Mack Daddy, y'all

Haters, better step back
Ladies, don't load your act
I'm the party application
Rocking just like that
