I never was a cool kid

No one ever really gave a damn what I did
I liked to party but I never got invited
Alone again so me, myself and I
Tried karaoke but they told me I was only OK
I guess I never shoulda sang Beyonce
Or M J
so I dropped the Mic

Oh yeah all the people in the bar turned round and stared
I was on my knees and whipping round my hair
and I knew that I was winning

Close my eyes and see the crowd
but my fingers don't make any sound
my Air Guitar
I keep it with me night and day
You won't believe the way that I can play
my Air Guitar, Air Guitar
like this
Bom chicka wah wah

In my head I am a Rockstar and I probably date a Pop Star
a Pop Star and a model on the side
I know I'll never make it
but tonight I'm good enough to fake it
bend an imaginary string and break it
replace it in the backstage of my mind

But I know my friends all think I'm living such a lie
but the lie they think I'm living get's my high
it's the gift that keeps on giving

Close my eyes and see the crowd
but my fingers don't make any sound
my Air Guitar
Jimmy Page and Brian May
Won't believe the way that I can play
my Air Guitar, Air Guitar
like this

You think there's nothing there
it's simply made of air
you laugh but you're just scared
try it if you dare

Air guitar, Air guitar
I take it with me everywhere
yeah but you don't even know it's there
my Air Guitar, Air Guitar
Close my eyes and see the crowd
but my fingers don't make any sound
my Air Guitar
keep it with me night and day
You won't believe the way that I can play
my Air Guitar, Air Guitar
