Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, and I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my best test
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

I won't hesitate no more
No more, it cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love
Listen to the music of the moment
Maybe sing with me
A la peaceful melody

It's your god-forsaken right to be
Loved loved loved love love

So, I won't hesitate no more

No more, it cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

-d-do do d-d-do -d-d-do dooo
I've been spending' way too long checking' my tongue in the mirror
And bending' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what I'm a saying's there isn't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do

Our name is our virtue
I won't hesitate no more

No more, it cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicated (Well open up your mind and see like me)
Our time is short (Open up your plans and damn you're free)

It cannot wait I'm yours (Look into your heart and you'll find love love love)
No, I won't hesitate (Listen to the music at the moment come and dance with me)
No more, no more (A la one big family)
It cannot wait I'm sure (It's your god-forsaken right to be loved love love love)
No need to complicate (Well open up your mind and see like me)
Our time is short (Open up your plans and damn you're free)
This is our fate, I'm yours(Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love)
No please, don't complicate (Listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me)
Our time is short (A la happy family)
This is our fate, I'm yours (It's your god-forsaken right to be loved love love love)
No please, don't hesitate (Listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me)
No more, no more (A la peaceful melodies)
It cannot wait, the sky is yours (It's your god-forsaken right to be loved love love love)
Oh i won't... (Well open up your mind.)
