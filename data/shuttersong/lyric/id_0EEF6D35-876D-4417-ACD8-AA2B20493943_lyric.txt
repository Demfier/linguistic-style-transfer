It really hurts to know that
I'm why your bed's half empty
When you sleep alone
and just stare up at your ceiling

And if you're a mess
God knows what that makes me
'Cause the weight from all my guilt
is all too much for me to carry

(I'm sorry)

Am I all that you never wanted
Or has it been so long
that you forgot it
All we ever share are dial tones
(dial tones)
Take your caution and take your chances
or may you run and break it in the same way
All we ever share are dial tones
(dial tones x2)

I'm getting more of what I've always wanted
but becoming less of who I've ever been
'cause I promised myself
I'd never hurt you and I did
If you can't trust a liar, how can you trust me again
(I'm running out of ways to say I'm sorry)

Am I all that you never wanted
Or has it been so long
that you forgot it
All we ever share are dial tones
(dial tones)
Take your caution and take your chances
or may you run and break it in the same way
All we ever share are dial tones

(Forget me like you know you want to
forget me like you know you have to)
