Change is inevitable
Why hold on to what you have to let go of?
Like, did I really break your heart?
Was it all my fault?
If you don't knock it off
You know like I know where this was headed, yeah

I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer, baby
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer

Lani Kai was nice
Turquoise seas and ocean breezes
Loving you was nice
But it's a new day, a new season
I've been sad inside
And he could see it, picked up your pieces
We are just alive
And alright, alright, alright

Hes a wanderer
Hes a wanderer, baby
He's a wanderer
Hes a wanderer

Started as a love song
24 years in the making
Moving from place to place and
I never really settled down
Without a place to call home
I got so used to the changes
Moving from stranger to strangest
You should face it
I am crazy

I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer, baby
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer

Shame on me for changing
No no no
Shame on you for staying the same
Shame on me for changing
Shame on you for staying the same
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer, baby
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer
Baby!
Maybe I just wonder why
Ohhh baby
Maybe I just wonder why
(Maybe I just wonder why)
Wander Wander Ohhh
Wanderer, baby
