The girl who always says yes
Wants to scream no
Takes over everyone's stress
And ignores her own
The life and soul of the party
But loves to stay home
She say's she's not broken-hearted
But she cries on her own

Playing pretend
I shouldn't hide it
It isn't right
Being a liar
I'm crossing the line
Dancing with fire,
When I'm not fine
Should I deny it?

Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay,
I keep praying that the cracks don't show my pain,
Cause even when I'm falling, I say my life is like a dream,
But I'm fighting through a nightmare,
Cause I'm not really being me,
See you don't really know me

The girl who starts all the jokes
Just make her laugh,
Preaches the do's and the don't's
But loves to be bad,
Smiles when they guess who she's loving
What they say makes her mad
She says "I'm fine, I need nothing"
But she hopes for your hand

Playing pretend
I shouldn't hide it
It isn't right
Being a liar
I'm crossing the line
Dancing with fire,
When I'm not fine
Should I deny it?

Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay,
I keep praying that the cracks don't show my pain,
Cause even when I'm falling, I say my life is like a dream,
But I'm fighting through a nightmare,
Cause I'm not really being me,
See you don't really know me, baby, oh no

You don't really know me, no no,
You don't really know me,
How can you know me?
You don't really know me,
You don't really know me,

Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay,
I keep praying that the cracks don't show my pain,
Cause even when I'm falling, I say my life is like a dream,
But I'm fighting through a nightmare,
Cause I'm not really being me,
See you don't really know me, baby, oh no,

How can you know me? me, me, me, ooh, mhhm
You're gunna get to know me
