I know you're thinkin that you heard this before
Some strings and bass to move your body to the floor (to the floor)
But girl don't matter if the beats are the same
Cause seeing your body move I'm just glad you came.

Errr time I hear this song I get up on my feet and dance.
I just want the same old noise that keeps my body in a trance!
