I Write Sins Not Tragedies - Panic! At The Disco
Oh well imagine
As I'm pacing the pews
In a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No I can't help but to hear
An exchanging of words
What a beautiful wedding
What a beautiful wedding
Says a bridesmaid to a waiter
Yes but what a shame
What a shame
The poor groom's bride
Is a whore
I'd chime in with a Haven't
You people ever heard of
Closing a goddamn door
No it's much better to
Face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise
And rationality
I'd chime in Haven't
You people ever heard of
Closing a goddamn door
No it's much better to face
These kinds of things
With a sense
Well in fact well
I'll look at it this way
I mean technically our
Marriage is saved
Well this calls for a
Toast so pour the champagne
Oh Well in fact well
I'll look at it this way
I mean technically
Our marriage is saved
Well this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne
Pour the champagne
I'd chime in with a Haven't
You people ever heard of
Closing a goddamn door
No it's much better to face
These kinds of things
With a sense of poise
And rationality
I'd chime in Haven't
You people ever heard of
Closing a goddamn door
No it's much better to face
These kinds of things
With a sense of poise
And rationality
Again
I'd chime in Haven't
You people ever heard of
Closing a goddamn door
No it's much better to face
These kinds of things
With a sense of poise
And rationality
I'd chime in  Haven't
You people ever heard of
Closing a goddamn door
No it's much better to face
These kinds of things
With a sense of poise
And rationality
Again
