Hey, you
Can I learn your flavour?
It's brand new
Now it's in the papers
All I seem to see
Must be something underneath

Take two.
I'm still tryna figure out what makes you hard on the call
I guess it comes from your heart
'Cause when your head's right
You take your time
There's something about the love for things you like

Fire when the strobe hits you, you
Bet you're looking for something new, whoa, oh, oh
I feel the heat with you starin' off across the room.
I dare you play your cards, boy
You bet I'm a TRNDSTTR, too
Fire when the strobe hits you
Bet you're looking for something new
Starin' off across the room
Bet I'm a TRNDSTTR, too

Bulletproof
On another level
Ahead of the crew
Select never settles
It only gets better the more you see
Powerful and free
Confidence is key

So watch me
Figure it out!
It's all about
What you bring to the crowd
Where your preference is loved
Mmm they're calling me over
Set your fire on me
Like what I see, you getting closer

Hey TRNDSTTR see your fire when the strobe hits you.
I-I didn't see who you came with, bet you looking for something new, whoa, oh, oh.
I feel the heat with you staring off across the room.
I dare you play your cards, boy
You bet I'm a TRNDSTTR, too
I feel the heat
Fire when the strobe hits you.
Bet you looking for something new, whoa oh, oh.
Staring off across the room.
Bet I'm a TRNDSTTR, too.
Whoa, oh, oh
