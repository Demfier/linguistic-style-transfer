When I breath and I breath into you
And I feel you right to the bone
And I gave what you give
And we go even higher than we are strong
And the cracks and the walls cover up
All the sheets, we live underneath
All the sex, all the nights we stay up
Yeah, we're stuck but we're more than free

(uh-oh, uh-oh)
Got the world in our hands like a land

Good enough to make the oceans look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, no that would never die
Oh, we got love

We got love
Good enough to make the oceans look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, no that would never die

Oh, we got love
We got love
I can feel that you feel what I feel
And I feel it all in your hands
When we touch is too much, and you're making me move
And now make me dance
Going body to body, for good saying:
'nobody gets it right'

We don't plan, we don't care, got the fume and the flame
We don't let it die

(uh-oh uh-oh)
Got the world in our hands like a land
Good enough to make the oceans look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops

And we live like legends now, no that would never die
Oh, we got love
We got love
Good enough to make the oceans look like it's a pond

Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, no that would never die
Oh, we got love
We got love
Perfect like a picture
I know we are one and the same
Perfect like a picture
Even when they look through the grains
Good enough to make the oceans look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, no that would never die
Oh, we got love
We got love
Good enough to make the oceans look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, no that would never die
Oh, we got love
We got love
