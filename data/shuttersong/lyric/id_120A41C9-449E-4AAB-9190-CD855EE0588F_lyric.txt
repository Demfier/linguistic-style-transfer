It's alright to tell me
what you think about me
I won't try to argue
or hold it against you
I know that your leavin
You must have your reasons
The season is callin
Your pictures are fallin down

The steps that I retrace
The sad look on your face
The timing, and structure
Did you hear that he fked her?
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report

on losing, and failing
When I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sticks to the masterplan
But everybody's gone
and I've been here for too long
to face this on my own

Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you
at a movie, sneak preview

You'll show up, and walk by
on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile, and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's ok
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone I won't come back
And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend

Someone that understands
Sticks to the masterplan
But everybody's gone
and I've been here for too long
to face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
