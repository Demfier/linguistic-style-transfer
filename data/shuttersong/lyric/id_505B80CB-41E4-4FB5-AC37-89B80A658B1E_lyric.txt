Throw your heart to me.
Let it fall and hit the ground.
Let it go.

Your timing was so wrong.
and I just want to be found.
And I yeah I... I got the lines.
I got the lines.

Oh it's brighter this time
This type of mine,
This disguise
Oh you talk oooohh to me.

Well Nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut.
I can see through them.
I can see through them.
I am drawing pictures I'm evading.
I will not use them.
I will not use them again.

And it starts again.
You come over with your friends.
I don't want to talk to them.

And all I really want
ItÂ´s to start again.

And I yeah I... I got the lines.
I got the lines.

Oh it's brighter this time
This type of mine,
This disguise
Oh you talk oooohh to me.

Nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut.
I can see through them.
I can see through them.
I am drawing pictures I'm evading.
I will not use them.
I will not use them

Coz I want to be bigger than life
Coz I want to be bigger than life

And nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut.
I can see through them.
I can see through them.
And I am drawing pictures I'm evading.
I will not use them.
I will not use them.

No Nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut.
I can see through them.
I can see through them.
