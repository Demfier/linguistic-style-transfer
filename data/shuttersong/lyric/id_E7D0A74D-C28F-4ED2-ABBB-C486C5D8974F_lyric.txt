This is the Autobiography of Nicki Maraj

May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic

My voice projected my life reflected
Daddy was a crack fiend
2 in the morning had us running down the block like a track team
When he burnt the house down n my mother was in it

How could I forget it the, pain infinite

Shes my queen and I ain't even British
Shes the only reason that I went to school and I finished
She told me that I had talent
Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent
She saw something in me that, until this day I don't know if I could be dat
But I'm a die tryin and when I'm done cryin
Grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring

Nightmares of you killing my mother

The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers

N shoulda thrown a book at

chu cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at chu
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic

Damn I wanna run to you
Hold you n kiss you tell you how I miss you
Thought I would have a son for you
But now it's official it's over and I can't let you go

But I gotta let you know all the shit
I did make it feel like I'm dyin real slow
cause no one understands me
they don't know what to do when I'm hurt when I'm angry
You was my friend and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me

anything I ever needed knew you had me

Cause of you all them chicks couldn't stand me

So why hurt you that's the question

It took this long for me to learn my lesson
Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
I finally understand the true meaning of karma
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic

Please baby forgive me, mommy was young
mommy was to busy tryna have fun now
I pat myself on the back for sending you back
cause god knows I was better than that
To conceive then leave you the concept alone seems evil
I'm trapped in my concience
I adhear to the nonsense listened to people
who told me I wasn't ready for you
But how the fuck would they know wat I was ready to do
And of course it wasn't your fault
It's like I feel it in the air
I hear you sayin mommy don't cry can't you see I'm right here
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleeping I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face or just hold your little hand
If it's part of gods plan, maybe we can met again
