When it's my time, I know you'll tailor a new suit for me
and buy a new tie, so I'll look this good.
Boy, you were right.
You said only the good ones die young
Never in my life did I look this good.

Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know, better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Uh-uh-uh
All of my friends are in the room
Uh-uh-uh
Party for me - I'd party too.

You're all on my tap
bartenders pour, all the whiskey's on me
and don't be so sad
Cause I lived this good
we were closer
now it's over
Oh it doesn't mean it's closure
I see you, and I love you
I'll be watching out above you

Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Uh-uh-uh
All of my friends are in the room
Uh-uh-uh
Party for me - I'd party too.
Uh-uh-uh
All of my friends are in the room
Uh-uh-uh
Party for me - I'd party too.

Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up

So welcome to my funeral
Welcome to my funeral.
