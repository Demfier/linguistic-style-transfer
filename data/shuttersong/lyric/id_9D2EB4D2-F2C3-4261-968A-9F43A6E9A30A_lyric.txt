I dont wanna go there.
We should never go there.
(Damn)
Why you wanna go there.

I guess i gotta go there.
Your hearing rumors about me
And you cant stomach the thought
Of someone touchin' my body
When your so close to my heart
I wont deny what their sayin'
Because most of it is true

But it was all before i fell for you
So please babe.
So please dont judge me
And I wont judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please dont judge me
And I wont judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful...
Let it be beautiful, oh oh

Let it be beautiful.
Let it be beautiful, oh ohh
Let it be beautiful.
Everything i say right now
Is gonna be used in another fight
I been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?

You gonna start askin me questions like
