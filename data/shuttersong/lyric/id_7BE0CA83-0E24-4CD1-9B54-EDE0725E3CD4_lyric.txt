We all put deep down
We could dive
Everything to make us feel alive
We need just our hands to keep us dry
Tonight

Because when the rain is falling
Down on me
Every drop could make me
Feel complete
Now good days are coming
Come with me
It's today

We'll take time out
To break the sky
I don't mind when the rain is coming
Take my love
Beside your lungs
So you can be breathing underwater

Take my love and let it glow
Feel your arms don't let me go
We'll be breathing underwater
Take my love and let it glow
Feel your arms don't let me go
We'll be breathing underwater
