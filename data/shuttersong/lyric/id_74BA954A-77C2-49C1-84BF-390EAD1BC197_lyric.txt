Mmm...
We broke down trying to leave town
Driving down the road to change
We were born to run, Cali here we come
Escape from nowhere USA
Say goodbye to white picket fences
Say hello to palm trees and Benzes
They say you have to fall to have it all
(Mmm...)
Yeah, well we don't want two kids and a wife
I don't want a job I just want a life
They say the underdogs rise
And the mighty'll fall
This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
â€˜Cuz Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So tell me whatever happened to the American dream
I know a girl I met her last night
She was fresh off the plane
She whispered in my ear
