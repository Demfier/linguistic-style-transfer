I'm feeling something something different
When you left I'd appeared to change
I was blinded I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame
It's an omen caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me that you are an omen
Not like you'd broke my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Omen
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Omen
You were waiting I was vacant
You left me for my eyes then it hit me
You're relocating and I need you by my side
It's an omen caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me that you are an omen
Not like you'd broke my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen
Not like you'd broke my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Omen
Woah now love
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Omen
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Omen
But now I see your tears are an omen
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Omen
Now I see your tears are an omen
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Omen
