Believe - Mumford &amp; Sons
You make call it in this evening
But you&apos;ve only lost the knife
Preset all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I&apos;m climbing over something
And I&apos;m running through these halls
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
Everything you tryna say to me
I had the strangest feeling
Your words not all it seems
So tired and misconceiving
What else this could&apos;ve been
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
Everything you tryna say to me
So open up my eyes  tell me I&apos;m a liar
This is never gonna go our way
If I&apos;m gonna have to guess what&apos;s on your mind
Oh say something  say something
Something like you love me
Does he wanna move away  from the noise of this place 
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
I don&apos;t even know if I believe
I don&apos;t even know if I wanna believe
Anything you try to say to me
So open up my eyes  tell me I&apos;m a liar
This is never gonna go our way
If I&apos;m gonna have to guess what&apos;s on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I&apos;m a liar
This is never gonna go our way
If I&apos;m gonna have to guess what&apos;s on your mind
