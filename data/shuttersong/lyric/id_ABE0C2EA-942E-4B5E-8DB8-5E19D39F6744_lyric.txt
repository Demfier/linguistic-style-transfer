Hey Baby, Mrs Cold
Acting so tough
Didn't know you had it in you to be hurt at all
You waited too long
You should have hooked me
Before I put my raincoat on

Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
You were fronting because
You knew you find yourself vulnerable around me
Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
You feel vulnerable around me

Hey baby
What's going on?
You lost control and you lost your tongue
You lost me
Deaf in my ear
Nothing you can say is gonna change the way I feel

Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
You were fronting because
You knew you find yourself vulnerable around me

Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
I step too close to your boundaries

You wanted nobody around to see
You feel vulnerable around me

Hey baby
What is love?
It was just a game
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
