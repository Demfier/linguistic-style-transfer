I've been looking under rocks and breaking locks
Just tryna find ya
I've been like a manic insomniac
Now I'm right behind ya
Whisper in your ear
When it gets rough baby just breathe
And where you had enough baby I'll be
Much more than a Grammy award
I'ma make you say my man

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shhh girl
Baby you could be a queen
I could be your it girl
Make you little when you wipe girl
No one does it better than I
I just wanna rock all night long
Play my body body till the sunriše

You can be my it girl
Come here for this girl
Let me hear it loud like
I'm screaming like, like oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Let me hear it loud like
I'm šcreaming like, like oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Let me tell you now

Enough of turning ends
I'm getting tired
I just wanna be around you
When you hold my body cloše,
Don't let it go
Hold me and you're better

Looking at my cards
Baby when you do I'm all done
Can you hear our heartš beating as one
Like a TV show playing reruns
Have a chance to get
If you turn me on

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shhh girl
Baby you could be a queen
I could be your it girl
Make you little when you wipe girl
No one does it better than I
I just wanna rock all night long
Play my body body till the sunrise

You can be my it girl
Come here for this girl
Let me hear it loud like
I'm screaming like, like oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Let me hear it loud like
I'm screaming like, like oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Let me tell you now
Sing it to me now

Can't seem to stop you from running through my mind
Just keep it coming, coming until i make you mine
You got that something, something for me big boy
You're my favorite girl
Just when you're šincere, yeah

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shhh girl
Baby you could be a queen
I could be your it girl
Make you little when you wipe girl
No one does it better than I
I just wanna rock all night long
Play my body body till the sunrise

You can be my it girl
Come here for this girl
Let me hear it loud like
I'm screaming like, like oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Let me hear it loud like
I'm screaming like, like oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
Let me tell you now
Sing it to me now
