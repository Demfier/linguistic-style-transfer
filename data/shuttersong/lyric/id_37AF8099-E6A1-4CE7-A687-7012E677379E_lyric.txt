Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big, and shine like stars
And we don't give a 'cause that's just who we are

And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
The crazy kids, them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
The crazy kids, we are the
We are the crazy people

I see ya in the club showin' Ke$ha love
Ain't trippin' on them that be hatin'
Catch a dub, chuckin' deuces
Ya'll hating's useless
It's such a nuisance
Ya'll chickens keep your two cents
And keep your dollars, keep your loot
I'm fresher than that Gucci
Them boys, they want my coochie
I say no, I'm no hoochie
Your home girl hatin', I say who she?
Ke$ha don't give two
I came to start that ruckus
And ya wanna party with us
'Cause we crazy

I'm buzzin' off these bubbles
I'm sippin' and I guzzle
I'm the new that says Mazel Tov
I bring the trouble
If they don't have no alcohol
Then I'm gonna smuggle
Some Rose, Chandon, drink 'til I see double
She put in my face and now I'm really seeing doubles
I, I took her to my place to blast off like the shuttle, wait
Kissing while we talkin'
So I'm speaking with a mumble
