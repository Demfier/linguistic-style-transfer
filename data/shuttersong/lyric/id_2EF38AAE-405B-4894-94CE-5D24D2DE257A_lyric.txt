Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide that sticks around like summat's
in your teeth?
Hide some aces up your sleeve
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
Cause there's this tune I've found that makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat until I fall asleep

Spilling drinks on my settee
(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(It's hard to see you go)
I'm sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)

That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
Cause I always do
Well baby I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open, and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do

We could be together if you wanted to
(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(It's hard to see you go)
I'm sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)

That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when
(You've had a few)
Cause I always do
(Well baby I'm too)
Way too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you
(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(It's hard to see you go)
I'm sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
crawling back to you
