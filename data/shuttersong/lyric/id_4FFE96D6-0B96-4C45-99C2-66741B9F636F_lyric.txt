Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself cause her liquour's top shelf
It's alarming honestly how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling how she's having fun

She says you don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things i've seen
I'm dying, i'm dying
She says you don't want to get this way
Famous, and dumb, and no age
My, i'm dying

The boys, the girls, they all like carmen
She gives them butterflies, but too coconize
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight, she's still shining
Like lightning, light, like lightning

Carmen, Carmen
Stayin' up 'til morning.
Only 17, but she walks the streets so mean.
It's alarming, truly, how disarmin'
We can be, eatin' soft ice cream'
Coney Island Queen

She says, 'You don't want to be like me, workin' for fun, getting high for free.'
I'm dying, I'm dying.'
She says you don't want to get this way
Street walking at night, and a star by day
It's tiring, tiring

The boys, the girls, they all like carmen
She gives them butterflies, but too coconize
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight, she's still shining
Like lightning, light, like lightning

Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Time and cherry marks while doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now, the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi

The boys, the girls, they all like carmen
She gives them butterflies, but too coconize
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight, she's still shining
Like lightning, light, like lightning

Like lightning, light, like lightning....

Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
