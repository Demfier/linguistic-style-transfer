Teenage Dream (Live) - 5 Seconds Of Summer	
 	

I think you're pretty,	
	
without any makeup on	
I think you're funny,	
when you tell the punch-line wrong	
I know you got me,	
so I let my walls hang down, down	
	
Before you met me,	
	
I was alright	
but things were kind of heavy,	
brought me to life	
now every February,	
	
you'll be my valentine, valentine	
	
So let's go all, the way tonight,	
	
no regrets, just love	
	
we can dance, until we die, you and I,	
	
we'll be young forever	
	
You, make, me,	
feel like I'm living a,	
Teenage, dream,	
the way you turn me on,	
I, can't, sleep,	
	
let's run away and	
don't ever look back,	
don't ever look back	
	
my, heart, stops,	
	
when you look at me,	
just, one, touch,	
	
now baby I believe,	
this, is, real,	
	
let's take a chance and	
don't ever look back	
don't ever look back	
	
We drove to Cali,	
and camped out on the beach	
got a motel and,	
built a house out of sheets	
I finally got you, my missing puzzle piece,	
	
I'm complete	
	
So let's go all, the way tonight,	
	
no regrets, just love	
	
we can dance, until we die, you and I,	
	
we'll be young forever	
	
You, make, me, feel like I'm living a,	
Teenage, dream, the way you turn me on,	
I, can't, sleep, let's run away and	
don't ever look back, don't ever look back	
Couse my, heart, stops, when you look at me,	
just, one, touch, now baby I believe,	
	
this, is, real, let's take a chance and	
don't ever look back, don't ever look back	
'Cause I can feel your heart racing,	
in my skin tight jeans,	
be your teenage dream tonight,	
	
let you rest your hands on me,	
in my skin tight jeans,	
be your teenage dream tonight
