You got that lemonade
But baby I ain't buyin'
Need something hotter to melt the ice
Get you some gatorade
Because your mouth is dying
From drooling over me day and night

Can't you hold your horses
I know you want the cake
But don't skip all the courses

Boy you're too thirsty for me eh, eh
Won't get to first base by begging me
You wanna play the game
Give me a little space
And maybe you'll get a taste
Boy you're too thirsty for me eh, eh

T to the H to the IRSTY you thirsty, you thirsty

You want that bottle pop
You want that coca-cola
But I'm not ready to open up
You want my walls to drop
Wanna invite me over
Then imma need you to slow that talk

Can't you hold your horses
I know you want the cake
But don't skip all the courses

Boy you're too thirsty for me eh, eh
Won't get to first base by begging me
You wanna play the game
Give me a little space
And maybe you'll get a taste
Boy you're too thirsty for me

Now I'm not saying that you're not my type
All that I'm saying is, girls never like
Boys who come chasing without any steaz
We don't like them that thirsty
