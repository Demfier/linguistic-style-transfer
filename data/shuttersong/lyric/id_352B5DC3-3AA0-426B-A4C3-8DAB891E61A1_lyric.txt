All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now
I didn't before

And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel right

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Is everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you.

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Is everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Is everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed.
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a newfound brightness
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
