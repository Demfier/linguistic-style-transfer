We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud
No we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday

I got a flow that'll make you drop
I got a flow that'll make you pop
I got a flow that'll make your mother and your father call the cops
We're gonna make this thing go blow, we're gonna system overload.
We're gonna be the generation that makes everything explode!

And I when I say explode I don't mean that we using bombs
We doing stuff that we don't ever have to tell our moms
Love the stuff we got,
We got it all up in the room
Paper chasing, yeah we got it everything we want

Somehow, some way
We're gonna have it our way
We don't give a what, what you say
No we don't

We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud
No we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday

We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Show everybody who runs this town
No we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday

Do ya, do ya, do ya know what I mean
I'm a princess, I don't wanna be the queen
Please don't say a thing Mr. Bean
Every time you talk gr', it makes me wanna scream

I don't know what you heard 'bout me
Don't remember holding out my pinky
I'm gonna finish off these MCs
Like they were my cup of tea

I got a flow that'll make you drop
I got a flow that'll make you pop
I got a flow that'll make your mother and your father call the cops

Somehow, some way
We're gonna have it our way
We don't give a what, what you say
No we don't

We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud

Bullseye again
I got 'em in a target, put 'em in a pocket, put 'em on a market
That's the way we did
You can see the way I walk and I talk
Every time I show her what I got I'm sprung, I don't want to grow up
Forever young
Why I don't ever wanna leave you
Better believe me, trust me she is the one
Gonna make all the people got up in the hard papers wanna hear it that
Are we gonna dump like this, leaning bend the body on the run
And then they gotta turn and twist
I guess it's time for pictures and my close up
I can do this to 'til infinity, I pray I never grow up

We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Show everybody who runs this town
No we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
We would do this everyday

We ain't ever gonna grow up
We just wanna get down
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud
No we'll never grow up
And if we had our way
