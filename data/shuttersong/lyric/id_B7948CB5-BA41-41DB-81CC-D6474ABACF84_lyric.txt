Hello, Mr Sun
Today's the day we change our plans
And end the war against our own selves

Goodbye, Mr Rain
Your time as come, your time has gone
So send your grey skies to someone else

Sun, shine on down
Ease our troubles now
Sun, shine on down

Sun, shine on down
Wring our worries out
Sun, shine on down
Shine on down

Here's to the girl who holds her heart out for the world
Not worried if her song is out of key
And here's to the boy who loves the girl and tells her so
Couldn't give a damn what other people think

Sun, shine on down
Ease our troubles now
Sun, shine on down, oh

Sun, shine on down
Wring our worries out
Sun, shine on down, oh

Live our lives and take our chances
We're still young enough to dream we will go far
'cause we don't care for all the answers
While we're basking in your golden shangri-la

Sha la la, la la la la la la la
Hey hey, hey hey
Sha la la, la la la la la la la
Hey hey, hey hey
Sha la la, la la la la la la la

Oh, sun, shine on down
Ease our troubles now
Sun, shine on down, oh

Sun, shine on down
Wring our worries out
Sun, shine on down, oh
Sun, shine on down
