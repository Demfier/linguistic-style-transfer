I had a ticket to ride, before you broke it
before you broke it for real
And I know that nobody could ever
take your place in the static space

I had a ticket to ride, if you try me
If you try me for real
'Cause I know that nobody could ever
fill your space, and we know it
and we know it

Oh, I had a beautiful time before you took it
before you took it from me
well I ever, ever come back
from this loneliness in the static space

I lost the key of my heart
I felt it all the way
all the way from the start

Oh we had a cynical life
but no one know the truth
I wont be able to lie again
to me or anyone else

I had a ticket to ride, before you broke it
before you broke it for real
and I know that nobody could ever
take your place in the static space
in the static space (in the static space)
in the static space
