I like to dance all night,
summons the day,
but that's how I play,
yeah that's how I play,
I said who are you?
don't matter who you are,
so we dance all night,
and dance all day

I say,
I say

We're gonna fuel the fire,
gonna stoke it up,
we're gonna sip this wine,
and pass the cup,
who needs avenues,
who needs reservoirs,
we're gonna show this town,
how to kiss these stars

I say,
I say

We're gonna hunt the kill,
gonna skin the hide
a yelp and scream,
and away I ride,
and every drop that spills,
on every plot of ground,
it's all for you,
for what you've found

I say,
I say,
I say,
I say

It's gonna take your head,
and gonna drive you home,
It's gonna keep on, keep on, keep on,
and then forever roam
