Coldplay - M.M.I.X.\n Somewhere up above the stars\n The wreckage of a universe floats past\n Somewhere up above my heart\n A tiny little seed is sown, \n A government is overthrown, \n Who knows when we'll be coming home at last\n And I heard it on the radio\n That one day we'll be living in the stars\n And I heard it on a tv show\n That somewhere up above\n And in my heart\n They'll be tearing us apart, \n Maybe moving us to mars\n Past the satellites and stars, \n Maybe moving us to mars\n We won't see the earth again\n In these seconds just remain unchanged\n 8 to 9, 9 to 10\n We are meeting for the first time\n We might never meet again you and me\n We are meeting for the first time\n Can't you see\n 76543\n We are meeting for the first time\n Singing this space symphony\n They'll be tearing us apart moving us to mars, \n Past the satellites and stars\n They're moving us to mars\n
