Stronger Than I Was - Eminem\n You used to say that\n I¡¯d never be nothing without you\n And I believe I¡¯m striding the roads\n I guess I can¡¯t breathe\n Just lay here with me  baby\n Hold me please\n And I beg and I plead  drop to knees\n And I cry and I¡¯d scream  baby\n Please don¡¯t leave\n Snatch the keys from your hand\n I would squeeze and you¡¯d laugh\n And you¡¯d tease\n You¡¯re just fvcking with me\n And you must hate me\n Why do you date me if you say I make you sick \n And you¡¯ve had enough of me\n I smother you\n I¡¯m ¡¯bout to jump off the edge\n But you won¡¯t break me\n You¡¯ll just make me stronger than I was\n Before I let you\n I bet you I¡¯ll be just fine without you\n And if I stumble  I won¡¯t crumble\n I¡¯ll get back up and uhhh\n And I¡¯mma still be humble when I scream fvck you\n Cause I¡¯m stronger than I was\n A beautiful face is all that you had\n Cause on the inside you¡¯re ugly  man\n But you¡¯re all that I love\n Aggressed  you can¡¯t leave\n Please stay here with me  baby\n Hold me please\n And I¡¯d beg and I plead  drop to knees\n And I¡¯d cry and I¡¯d scream  baby\n Please don¡¯t leave\n Cause you left and you took everything I had left\n And left nothing  nothing for me\n So please don¡¯t wake me from this dream  baby\n We¡¯re still together in my head\n And you¡¯re still in love with me\n Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead\n But you won't break me\n You'll just make me stronger than I was\n Before I let you\n I bet you I'll be just fine without you\n And if I stumble  I won't crumble\n I'll get back up and uhhh\n And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you\n Cause I'm stronger than I was\n You walked out  I almost died\n It was almost a homicide\n That you caused cause I was so traumatized\n Felt like I was in for a long bus ride\n I¡¯d rather die than you not be by my side\n Can¡¯t count how many times I vomited  cried\n Go to my room  turn the radio on and hide  uh\n We were Bonnie and Clyde\n No  on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I\n Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie\n It was you and I  why did I think it was ride or die \n Cause if you could¡¯ve took my life you would¡¯ve\n It¡¯s like you put a knife to my chest\n And pushed it right through to the\n Other side of my pack and stuck a spike  too  should¡¯ve\n Put up more of a fight  but I couldn¡¯t at the time\n No one could hurt me like you could¡¯ve\n Take you back now  what¡¯s the likelihood of that\n Bite me  bitch  chewing on a nineteen footer\n Cause this morning I finally stood up\n Held my chin up  finally showed a sign of life in me for the\n First time since you left me\n And left me with nothing but shattered dreams\n And a life we could¡¯ve had and we could¡¯ve been\n But I¡¯m breaking out of this slump I¡¯m in\n Pulling myself out of the dumps once again\n I¡¯m getting up once and for all  fvck this shit\n I¡¯mma be late for the pity party\n But you¡¯re never gonna beat me\n To the fvcking punch again\n Took it on the chin like a champ so\n Don¡¯t lump me in with the chumpy ends\n I¡¯m done being your punching bag\n It was the November 31st today\n Would¡¯ve been our anniversary\n Two years  but you left on the first of May\n I wrote it on the calender  was gonna call\n But couldn¡¯t think of the words to say\n But it came to me just now\n So I put ¡®em in a verse to lay\n And I thank you cause you\n Made me a better person than I was\n But I hate you cause you drained me\n I gave you all  you gave me none\n But if you blame me  you¡¯re crazy\n And after all that¡¯s said and done\n I¡¯m still angry  yeah  I maybe\n I may never trust someone\n But you won't break me\n You'll just make me stronger than I was\n Before I let you\n I bet you I'll be just fine without you\n And if I stumble  I won't crumble\n I'll get back up and uhhh\n And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you\n Cause I'm stronger than I was
