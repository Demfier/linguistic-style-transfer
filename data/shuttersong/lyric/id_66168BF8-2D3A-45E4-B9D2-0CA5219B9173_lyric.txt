I don't know if I'm worse when I'm rich or when I'm broke niggaz
Same attitude you got it go 'head smoke nigga!

Power by 50, goddamn it; I think I made it! 
I tried to keep it basic, they wanna complicate shit, 
The Feds on my phone that's why I don't ever say shit.
Portray bein' a friend to me and I'll make you a memory, 
The.40 Cali burn you be smokin' like a chimney! 
Niggaz sick of pussy shit and me I'm jus' a remedy!
