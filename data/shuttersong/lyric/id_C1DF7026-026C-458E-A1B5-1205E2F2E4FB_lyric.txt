The shadow of your smile
Under the open skies
As I close my eyes
I can feel the wind arise

We're made of stardust
Our lives ahead of us

We'll ride the magic bus into the heart of love

I can taste it, taste the feeling
of the blue skies they're for real and
we're the center of the universe
Just you and I, and I, and I
