You Don't Own Me - Grace  G-Eazy\n You don't own me\n You don't own me\n Woah let's go\n But I'm Gerald and I can always have just what I want\n She's that baddest I would love to flaunt\n Take her shopping you know Yves Saint Laurent\n But nope she ain't with it though\n All because she got her own dough\n Boss bossed if you don't know\n She could never ever be a broke ho\n You don't own me\n I'm not just one of your many toys\n You don't own me\n Don't say I can't go with other boys\n And don't tell me what to do\n And don't tell me what to say\n Please when I go out with you\n Don't put me on display\n You don't own me\n Don't try to change me in any way\n You don't own me\n Don't tie me down cause I'd never stay\n And don't tell me what to do\n And don't tell me what to say\n Please when I go out with you\n Don't put me on display\n Really though honestly\n I get bored of basic bitches\n She's the baddest straight up vicious texting her asking her\n If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures she said no what\n Well goddamn she said come over and see it for yourself\n Never asking for your help independent woman\n She ain't for the shelf\n No she's the one\n Smoke with her till the weed is gone\n Stayin' up until we see the sun\n Baddest ever I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done\n Never borrow she ain't ever loan\n That's when she told me she ain't ever ever ever gonna be on\n I don't tell you what to say\n I don't tell you what to do\n So just let me be myself\n That's all I ask of you\n I'm young and I love to be young\n I'm free and I love to be free\n To live my life the way I want\n To say and do whatever I please
