Out of my cage through an open door,
Feeling less tired than I did before.
I broke my fever then I broke my chains,
I don't like liars and I don't like change.

I tried to run but I was much too slow,
I'm only young but that was long ago.
The air was cooler now it burns my lungs,
Stains my eyes and stills my tongue.
