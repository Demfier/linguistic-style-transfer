Bells will be ringing this sad sad news

Oh what a christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone
I have no friends to wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing (ooh...) silent night
Christmas carols (ooh...) by candlelight
Please come home for christmas
Please come home for christmas
If not for christmas by new year's night
Friends and relations send salutations

Sure as the stars shine above
But this is christmas yeah christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love
So won't you tell me (ooh...) you'll never more roam
Christmas and new years (ooh...) will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain
And I'll be happy happy once again
Ooh there'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain
And I'll be happy christmas once again
