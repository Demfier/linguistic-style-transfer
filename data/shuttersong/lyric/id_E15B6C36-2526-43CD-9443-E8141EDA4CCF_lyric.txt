ThatPOWER - will.i.am,Justin Bieber
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second minute hour
Bigger better stronger power
I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power power power
They call will-A
Stay so cool, I'm chilli
I done made that maley
On my way to that valet
Used to have a ticket thing,
But now I got that bigger bank
Who who cares what the haters state
They hate on me cause we doing what they can't
I stay on that hussle, I flex that loose to muscle
Hate to bust your bubble
I'm on that other level
I'mma take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keeping burning like that fire
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second minute hour
Bigger better stronger power
I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power power power
Yes yes yes y'all feeling funky fresh yall
Work to be the best yall
We're good under pressure yall
Been through all that stress y'all
Get this off my chest yall
Made it out in project
Where this project that's progress yall
I beat it through my mama
I told her what I was on it
That I'mma be that number
One day ill be that number 1
I take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keeping burning like that fire
Whatever doesn't kill you,
Only makes you stronger
So I'mma get stronger
Call me like a veteran, veteran
I lock lock it down and go again go again
Call me like a veteran, veteran
I lock lock it down and go again go again
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second minute hour
Bigger better stronger power
I got that power
I got that power

Power power power
And I'm loving every second minute hour
Bigger better stronger power
And I'm loving every second minute hour
Bigger better stronger power
