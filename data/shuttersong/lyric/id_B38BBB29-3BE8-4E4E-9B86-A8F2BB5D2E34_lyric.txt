You made me

Everything that I am

You called me names till I became a name

Now that's all that I understand

Now the joke's on you cause the whole damn world's at the bottom of the fool's head

Now the fool's got to choose

And the joker's in the smoker with his palm on the hot pan

Cause I'm that boy with the ball and chain

Floating through the sky, looking down from my jet plane

Looking down from my jet plane, oh

Yeah, I'm that boy with the ball and chain

The boy with the ball and chain

Now I'm looking down from my jet plane
