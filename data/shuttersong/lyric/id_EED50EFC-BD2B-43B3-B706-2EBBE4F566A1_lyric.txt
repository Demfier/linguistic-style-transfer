Paula the koala
She MOVED to Guatemala
Cuz she heard the trees there were a little taller
Turned out they were smaller
So she moved to lake eufuala
Then to Walla Walla Washington
So if you live in Walla Walla
And you see a koala
You can BET your bottom dollar
That koala's name is Paula
Paula the koala
Who lives in walla walla
Walla walla Washington
She's cute
She's kind
She the coolest marsupial that you could ever find
She's sweet She's smart
She's a smalla with a great big HEART
