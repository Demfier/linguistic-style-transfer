We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'm letting you fly

'Cause I know in my heart babe

Our love will never die
No
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on

(No no no no)

No way you're never gonna shake me

If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably you'll be back again

'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no
You'll always be apart of me
