I'm so happy
'Cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly
That's okay 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared, light my candles
In a daze 'cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so lonely
That's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad and just maybe
I'm to blame for all I've heard
I'm not sure, I'm so excited

I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care, I'm so horny
That's okay, my will is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack

I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I'm so happy
'Cause today I found my friends-they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors

Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I like it, I'm not gonna crack

I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
