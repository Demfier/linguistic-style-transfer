Stressed Out - Twenty One Pilots \n Written by£ºJoseph Taylor\n I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard\n I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words\n I wish I found some chords in an order that is new\n I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang\n I was told when I get older  all my fears would shrink\n But now I'm insecure  and I care what people think\n My name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n My name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n Wish we could turn back time to the good old days\n When our momma sang us to sleep\n But now we're stressed out\n Wish we could turn back time to the good old days\n When our mama sang us to sleep\n But now we're stressed out\n We're stressed out\n Sometimes a certain smell will\n Take me back to when I was young\n How come I'm never able to identify\n Where it's coming from \n I'd make a candle out of it  if I ever found it\n Try to sell it  never sell out of it\n I'd probably only sell one\n It'd be to my brother  cause we have the same nose\n Same clothes  home grown\n The stone's throw from a creek we used to roam\n But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered\n Out of student loans and tree house homes\n We all would take the latter\n My name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n My name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n Wish we could turn back time to the good old days\n When our mama sang us to sleep\n But now we're stressed out\n Wish we could turn back time to the good old days\n When our mama sang us to sleep\n But now we're stressed out\n Used to play pretend  give each other different names\n We would build a rocket ship\n And then we'd fly it far away\n Used to dream of outer space\n But now they're laughing at our face singing\n Wake up  you need to make money  yeah\n Used to play pretend  give each other different names\n We would build a rocket ship\n And then we'd fly it far away\n Used to dream of outer space\n But now they're laughing at our face singing\n Wake up  you need to make money  yeah\n Wish we could turn back time to the good old days\n When our mama sang us to sleep\n But now we're stressed out\n Wish we could turn back time to the good old days\n When our mama sang us to sleep\n But now we're stressed out\n We used to play pretend\n Used to play pretend  funny\n We used to play pretend\n Wake up you need the money\n Used to play pretend  used to play pretend  bunny\n We used to play pretend\n Wake up you need the money\n Used to play pretend\n Give each other different names\n We would build a rocket ship\n And then we'd fly it far away\n Used to dream of outer space\n But now they're laughing at our face saying\n Wake up  you need to make money  yeah
