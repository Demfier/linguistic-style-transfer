Just somethin' about you
Way I'm lookin at you whatever
keep lookin at me
Gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right?
Listen

I kind of noticed something wasn't right
In your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change...

If you smilin', that should set the tone
Just be limber
And If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

People are so phony
Nosy cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating
When it doesn't matter anyway
Cause we're here tonight

If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then ...

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...

Ma, what you wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
From them you heard \
