We were born ready
Ready to be free
Chasing every thrill we could see
With my eyes steady
Wake into a dream
Aching to be thrown in the ring
If nothing comes easy
As long as we're breathing
We'll go all the way or go home
We we're born ready, wherever it leads
What we have is all we need

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know
Is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft
Before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride
'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know
Is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know
Is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft
Before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

We were born hungry
Hungry for the rush
Screaming when they tell us to hush
Hit the ground running
Leave them in the dust
Only run with those we can trust
If nothing comes to us
We fly where it's bluest
As we're ready to face the unknown
We were born hungry
We'll never get enough
'Cause we're only here this once

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know
Is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft
Before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

Let's do it again
Let's make it tonight
Yeah, let's go until the sky gets lighter
And if it's fast or slow
All I really know
Is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

'Cause if it's fast or slow
All I really know
Is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it's hard or soft
Before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

Let's do it again
Let's make it tonight
Yeah, let's go until the sky gets lighter
And if it's fast or slow
All I really know
Is I'm gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride
