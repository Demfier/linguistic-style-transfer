Barbwire fence carving out a hillside, cutting holes in the midday sun, like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust.
I love the rythmn of an old gray black top, 33's just whistling bye, steer the wheel one handed on a two lane hugging that line.
I got the windows down, No one else around
singing ohhhh
freedom is the miles I'm rolling on

ohhhhhh
out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong, come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.
oooohhhhh oooohhhhh
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammered down and passed him on up, The breeze smeels like a summertime hay field thats just been cut.
I got the windows down way out of town
singing ooohhhh
freedom is the miles im rolling on

ohhhhhh
out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong, come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.

ooooohhhh ooooohhh
The only way today could get better, girl what im thinking, is I can pick you up you slide in this truck and I can hear you singin'
oooohhhhh
Let me hear you singin'
oooohhhh
oooohhhh
freedom is the miles im rolling on
oooohhhhhh

out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong, come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.

This is my backroad song
