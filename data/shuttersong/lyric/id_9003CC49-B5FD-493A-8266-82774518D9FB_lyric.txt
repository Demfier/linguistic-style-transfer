How do you do it?
How do you know?
To keep on walking when there's nowhere to go?
Man on the news he said:
Try not to be scared
Blood, love and terror. Next, the weather
Generation strange

It's general ache and pain
It's pressure from the weight of all the satellites in space
You never let it crush
Even when you should
Tell me how you do it?
How do you do it so good?
How do you do it?

How do you do it?
How do you do it so good?
How do you do it?
How do you do it?
How do you do it so good?

Man on the moon looked down
To his surprise
Earth wasn't round, it was a square in disguise
He looked at the stars and saw
A chocolate Mars and poor
Venus and razor blades
In Saturn a Sega game

Generation strange
It's general ache and pain
It's pressure from the weight of all the satellites in space
You never let it crush
Even when you should
Tell me how you do it?

How do you do it so good?
How do you do it?
How do you do it?
How do you do it so good?
How do you do it?
How do you do it?

How do you do it so good?

Aching, aching everywhere
Do you ever listen with charm and gab
Sticky fingers, bone and flab?

How do you do it?
How do you do it?
How do you do it so good?
How do you do it?
How do you do it?
How do you do it so good?
Generation strange's general ache and pain
Is pressure from the weight of all the satellites in space
But you never let it crush, even when you should
Tell me how you do it so good
