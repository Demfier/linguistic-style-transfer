Boy, step a little closer
'Cause I don't think you've heard these words before (yeah)
Lay me left and rock me right
Baby, lift me up so high
Take me to another world (ye-yeah)

'Cause no one else will do (woo)
Don't wanna be by myself
I wanna be dancing with you

Cause you're my stereo, stereo, stereo soldier
(Oh, oh)
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier
(Oh, oh)
All I need is the beat in my feet
Let me lose control
(Oh, oh)
Give me loud, give me now
Take my heart, baby take my soul
(Left, right, left, right)

Run the beat and blow my speakers
And make me feel like I'm the only girl
(Yeah)
The way we move is so in time
I'm the rare, got the skills to blow my mind
They don't make 'em like you no more (ye-yeah)

I'm in heaven now, so in love
Lay your weapons down, and turn it up
Up, up, up, up (woo)

And be my stereo, stereo, stereo soldier
(Oh, oh)
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier
(Oh, oh)
All I need is the beat in my feet
Let me lose control
Give me loud, give me now
Take my heart, baby, take my soul
(Left, right, left, right)

Can you save me?
Can you set me free?
'Cause I need to feel alive
Oh, we have to survive

'Cause you changed me
Now I believe
And I need to feel alive
Oh, we have to survive

Stereo, stereo, stereo soldier
Oh, oh
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier
(Oh, oh)
All I need is the beat in my feet
Let me lose control (let me lose control)
Give me loud, give me now
Take my heart, baby, take my soul
(Left, right, left, right)
