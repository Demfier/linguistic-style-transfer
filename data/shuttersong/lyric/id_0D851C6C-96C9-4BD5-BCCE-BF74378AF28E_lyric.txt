Yeah, I be in the nine two five
Tryna get you and some Boba right by my side
So baby if you didn't schedule any plans tonight
I can see us in a slowdance with the ocean sight
Cause if it's you than girl I'm with it
You know that if I could than I would probably spend every minute
On my wristwatch
Tryna get lost in an adventure
Stuck in a Kodak, I'm loving the picture
Yo

You got a smile
That'll knock me off my feet
Would stay for a while
Let me enjoy your company
Ain't no cloudy days when I see your face
I think it's easy to see
That you're the only one for me

You're the only one I need, I said
You're the only one I need, hey
You're the only one I need, I said
You're the only one I need

Oh yeah, let's go
All I see is you
Ain't no other girls getting in the way of my view
I been all about that real and you got all of the truth
And know I really like that curly hair thing that you do
Aye, hold up, I'm a tell you one time, one time
It's your love I talk about in my rhymes
So hit the replay, hit the rewind
And let me tell you bout this girl that I get to call mine

You got a smile
That'll knock me off my feet
Would stay for a while
Let me enjoy your company
Ain't no cloudy days when I see your face
I think it's easy to see
That you're the only one for me

You're the only one I need, I said
You're the only one I need, hey
You're the only one I need, I said
You're the only one I need

Got me feeling like I'm on top of the world
Every little thing that you do
Three words and I mean every one
When I tell you that I love you
On the floor just you and me
Ain't nobody else coming around, nah
Baby girl won't you take my hand
And we can dance till the moon goes down
