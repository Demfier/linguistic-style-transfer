When your legs don't work like
they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still
remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
Darlin' I will
Be lovin' you
Till we're seventy
Baby my heart
Could still fall as hard
At twenty three
I'm thinkin' bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just a touch of a hand
Me I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name

When my hands don't play
the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul
Can never grow old
It's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind in memory
I'm thinkin' bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
(al la la la la la la la la)

Baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under
the light of a thousand stars (oh darlin')
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
Maybe We found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
