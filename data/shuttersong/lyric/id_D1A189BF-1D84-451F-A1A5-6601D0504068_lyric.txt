Why do you try so hard wasting all my time
Am I your #1?
I feel so far behind


Why do you give yourself out to everyone
Am I not good enough?
Been at it for so long

Is this all pretend?
I'm in over my head

Teenage Desperate
Begging for attention
Doesn't wanna be alone
Calls up my phone
Probably 7th option
Asking baby are you home?

Listening behind closed doors
Sick of sleeping on the floor

Baby just let me in
let me in

Why don't you let it out
Time is not my friend
Am I your #2?
or am I at the end?

Why do you go so fast
always switching lanes?
am I your #3?
or am I just insane?

Is this part pretend
I'm in over my head

Teenage Desperate
Begging for attention
Doesn't wanna be alone
looking for some closure
so she takes her clothes off
but she fakes it when she moans
