Como cuando la camara frontal sale sin querer xD

Here we are standing at the gate
And I don't know where I'm going
All I know is that it ain't with you
My heart is beating out of my chest
Now those beautiful eyes are welling up with tears
Because our fears have come
Even if the sky comes falling down
I know I'll make it home to you somehow
'Cause baby it's Christmas
I'm trying so hard just to get to you
And girl I miss you so much
Watching this old clock is what gets me through
Closer to you in the snowflake fall
A couple of babies and their crying call
I need to be home so we can be us
'Cause baby it's Christmas
It's Christmas
Now I'm laying here closing my eyes
I can feel the rhythm of your heartbeat locked in time
Here with mine tonight
And I can't smell the scent of the pine
And hear the laughing of our daughters
As they open up their presents for the first time
'Cause baby it's Christmas
I'm trying so hard just to get to you
And girl I miss you so much
Watching this old clock is what gets me through
Closer to you in the snowflake fall
A couple of babies and their crying call
I need to be home so we can be us
'Cause baby it's
Bells ringing
Church singing
Making angels in the backyard
Slow dancing
Romancing
Snuggled up right next to the fire
Our love is much stronger
Than any distance we could know
So I'm coming home
My baby I'm coming home
This Christmas
I'm on my way home just to get to you
Because I miss you so much
I walk in the door just right on cue
Closer to you in the snowflake fall
A couple of babies and their crying call
I made it home so we can be us
Now baby it's Christmas
Now baby it's Christmas
It's Christmas
