You know how I get when the sun goes down
How it feels when no one's around
I know, I know-ow-ow
I know, I know-ow
I get kinda lost and I can't see straight
Hate it, but it's just what we take
I know, I know-ow-ow
I know, I know-ow

I get bitten by the lonely
but when I'm not the only
When I'm, when I'm not the only
One who feels it
Maybe it's sick to say
But it helps that you feel the same

I know, I know-ow-ow
(When the lights go out)
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
We're glowing in the dark
We'll light up Central Park
We're lights that never go out
'Cause you're here with me now

Dark days, but it's alright
So fine, every night
Oh oh, woah oh oh
glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark

Doing two-way when way above the clouds
Rooftop, yeah, we're just hanging out
I know, I know-ow-ow
I know, I know-ow
Now we're looking down like we've got no fear
We've got dreams and it starts right here
I know, I wanna know-ow-ow
I know, I wanna know-ow

We get bitten by the lonely
but when we're not the only
Yeah we're, yeah we're not the only
Once you know the way
You get through the night
It's to bring on a little bright

I know, I know-ow-ow
(When the lights go out)
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
glowing in the dark
We'll light up Central Park
We're lights that never go out
'Cause you're here with me now

Dark days, but it's alright
So fine, every night
Oh oh, woah oh oh
glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark

When I'm bitten by the lonely
You can get to know me
I know, I know-ow-ow

We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
We're glowing in the dark
We'll light up Central Park
We're lights that never go out
'Cause you're here with me now
Dark days, but it's alright
So fine, every night
Oh oh, woah oh oh
glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark
