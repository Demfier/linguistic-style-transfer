I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black, and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang, bang, he shot me down
Bang, bang, I hit the ground
Bang, bang, that awful sound
Bang, bang, my baby shot me down
Down, down, down…

Bang, wizzz, zap, paw
Bang, wizzz, zap, paw
