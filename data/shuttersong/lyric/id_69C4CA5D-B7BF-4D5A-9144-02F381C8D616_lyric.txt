Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker, West West y'all
Yeah, L.A. niggaz, L.A. niggaz rule the world nigga
Y'all niggaz gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin'?
Niggaz don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin'?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin'? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggaz, connected all over the motherfuckin' world, nigga
Recognize this

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd from the feet up, blued up from the sewer's how I grew up
Lockin' smokin' and drinkin 'til we threw up
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditchin my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up

But don't sleep, y'all niggaz quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got 'em jumpin'

I'm comin' \
