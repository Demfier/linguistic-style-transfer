Heartbreaks and promises
Sam Feldt&Kimberly Anne
I've had more than my share
Tired of giving my love
And getting nowhere nowhere
It's been so long since
I've touched a wanting hand
I put my love on the line
Which I hope you understand
Oh baby if you want me
You got to show me love
Words are so easy to say
But you got to show me love
But you got to show me love
I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one-night affairs
What I need is somebody
Who always be there
Don't you promise me the world
World that I already own
This time call me baby
Actions speack louder than words
If you're looking for devotion talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Cause my love is guaranteed
So baby if you want me
You got to show me love
Words are so easy to say
But you got to show me love
Words are so easy to say
But you got to show me love
