Oh!
...2, 3, 4!
Helpless!
My eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside!
You sealed your demise when you
Took what was mine!
Don't try to stop me from avenging this world!

No voice to be heard
Waking the demon!
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows!

Watch the blood flow!
There's not much longer
so don't try and hide
Your body's weakening
walk to the light!
Those painful times so alone, so ashamed!
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain!
Caution!

There's just no limit to the boundaries you push!
I've warned you but still you just
Fuck with my mind!
There's no escape from this rage that I feel!
Nothing is real!
Waking the demon!
Where'd you run to?

Walking in shadows!
Watch the blood flow!
There's not much longer
so don't try and hide

Your body's weakening
walk to the light!
Those painful times so alone, so ashamed!
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain!

Breathe for me!
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me!
Possession taking over

Breathe for me!
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me!
Possession taking over

Whoa!
Tread!
Breathe for me!
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me!
Possession taking over
Breathe for me!
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me!
Possession taking over
Waking the Demon!
