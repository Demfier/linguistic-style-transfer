Just being honest
can't tie me down
Life is a short trip
and I've been around

Oh, Sydney, Ireland, Tokyo

don't tell the man

I swear I didn't know it but
she didn't care
So I put your hands where I can see

Make you write this song for me
She's

So

Bad she's good for me
This girl
knows

ways you won't believe
ooh oh
One night is all she needs
Love me

leave me
left me numb
Did you have your fun?
I like the music
and asked her to dance

Said no one leaves them
don't tell my friends
Underneath the street lights, there was smoke in the air
She said she's never like this while
she's pulling my hand

Tell her put your hands where I won't see
Baby I won't say a thing
Stop leaving stains of cigarettes
And come put your lips on me
She's
So
bad she's good for me
This girl
knows
ways you won't believe
ooh oh
One night is all she needs
Love me
leave me
left me numb
Did you have your fun?
What you running from?
Drop the guns, I'm singing drop the guns
Tell me what is you running from?
Drop the guns
Drop the guns
Drop the guns
baby
did you
have your fun?
She's
So
bad she's good for me
This girl
knows
ways you won't believe
ooh oh
One night is all she needs
Love me
Leave me
left me numb
Love me
Leave me
left me numb
She's
So
bad she's good for me
This girl
knows
ways you won't believe
ooh oh
One night is all she needs
Love me
leave me
left me numb
Did you have your fun?
