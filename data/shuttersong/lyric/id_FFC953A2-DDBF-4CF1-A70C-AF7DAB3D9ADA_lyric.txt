Hey If you ever want to leave it all
If you ever want to lose control
Leave it all escape so far away
Maybe then youâ€˜ll think it is OK
But I'll tell you how I see it now
Take the guitar and I'll tell you how
I just wanna show you how to stay
Listen and you'll never go away

Listen and you'll never go away

In the glow of starry sky
Seven nights I would lie
Now I know I wanna stay
I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I wanna stay
I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away ay ay
I will never go away

Listen and you'll never go away

In the glow of starry sky
Seven nights I would lie
Now I know I wanna stay
I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I wanna stay
I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away ay ay
I will never go away

I will never go away
Now I know I wanna stay
Now I know I wanna stay
Now I know I wanna stay
I will never go away
Now I know I wanna stay
Now I know I wanna stay
Stay Stay Stay Stay
I will never go away

In the glow of starry sky
Seven nights I would lie
Now I know I wanna stay
I will never go away
In the moonlight hear the song
And still listen all night long
Now I know I wanna stay
I will never go away
I will never go away
I will never go away ay ay
I will ever go away
Listen and you'll never go kurwa
