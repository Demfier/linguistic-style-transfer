All I Want For Christmas Is You - Justin Bieber/Mariah Carey\n Written by£ºMariah Carey/Walter Afanasieff\n I just can't wait\n I don't want a lot for Christmas\n There is just one thing I need\n And I don't care about the presents\n Underneath the Christmas tree\n I don't need to hang my stocking\n There upon the fireplace\n Santa Claus won't make me happy\n With a toy on Christmas Day\n I just want you for my own\n More than you could ever know\n Make my wish come true\n All I want for Christmas\n Is you\n You  baby\n Oh  I won't ask for much this Christmas\n I won't even wish for snow\n And I'm just gonna keep on waiting\n Underneath the mistletoe\n I won't make a list and send it\n To the North Pole for Saint Nick\n I won't even stay awake to\n Hear those magic reindeer click\n Cause I just want you here tonight\n Holding on to me so tight\n What more can I do \n Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you\n You\n Oh-ho  all the lights are shining\n So brightly everywhere\n And the sound of children\n Laughter fills the air\n And everyone is singing\n I hear those sleigh bells ringing\n Santa won't you bring me the one I really need \n Won't you please bring my baby to me \n Yeah\n Oh  I don't want a lot for Christmas\n This is all I'm asking for\n I just wanna see my baby Yeahhh\n Standing right outside my door\n Oh I just want you for my own\n For my own\n Baby\n More than you could ever know\n Make my wish come true\n Baby all I want for Christmas is\n You baby\n All I want for Christmas is you baby\n All I want for Christmas is you baby\n All I want for Christmas is you baby
