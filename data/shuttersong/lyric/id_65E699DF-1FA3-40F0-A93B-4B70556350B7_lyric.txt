When your walkin' down the street
And a man tries to get your business
And the people that you meet
Want to open you up like christmas
You gotta wrap your fuzzy in a big red bow
Ain't no sum bitch gonna treat me like a ho
I'm a classy honey kissy huggy lovey dovey ghetto princess

'cause you're filthy
Oooh and i'm gorgeous
'cause you're filthy
Oooh and i'm gorgeous
You're disgusting
Oooh and you're nasty
And you can grab me
Oooh 'cause you're nasty

When you're runnin' from a trick
And you trip on a hit of acid
You gotta work for the man,
But your biggest moneymaker's flaccid
You gotta keep your shit together
With your feet on the ground
There ain't knowone gonna listen if you haven't made a sound
You're an acid junkie college flunky dirty puppy daddy bastard

'cause you're filthy
Oooh and i'm gorgeous
'cause you're filthy
Oooh and i'm gorgeous
You're disgusting
Oooh and you're nasty
And you can grab me
Oooh 'cause you're nasty
