Are you ready? Ha

It's time for me to take it

I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it
Not when you go down
Cause this is my game
And you better come to play

I used to hold my freak back
Now I'm letting go
I make my own choice
Bitch, I run this show
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave

(Oh oh, oh) so you say I'm complicated
That I must be outta my mind
But you've had my underrated
Rated, rated, rated

(Ah ha) what's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)

It's time to get the chains out
Is your tongue tied up?
Cause this is my ground
And I'm dangerous
And you can get out
But it's all about me tonight (tonight, ha)

(Oh oh, oh) so you say I'm complicated
That I must be outta my mind
But you've had my underrated
Rated, rated, rated

(Ah ha) what's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)

(Ah ha)
(Hey!)
La, la, yeah

So you say I'm complicated
But you've had me underrated
(Ah ha) what's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? (ah ha)
