When I close my eyes I hear you singing
Singing me a song that I'll forget
I always forget

I try to take myself back to sleeping
You pick me up but I let you down

It was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay?
Stay... stay
If only I could dream we could start again
If only I could dream we could start again

Ooohhh... oooh

When I close my eyes I see you dancing
Dancing me a song
Just out of reach, just out of reach

I need you in a day when I'm not dreaming
You pick me up
I don't wanna let you down

It was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay?
Stay... stay
If only I could dream we could start again
If only I could dream we could start again

Ooohhh... oooh

It was so clear but now it's gone
I couldn't keep my eyelids shut
Why can't you stay?
Stay... stay... stay
If only I could dream we could start again
Stay
If only I could dream we could start again
Stay
If only I could dream we could start again
If only I could dream we could start again
