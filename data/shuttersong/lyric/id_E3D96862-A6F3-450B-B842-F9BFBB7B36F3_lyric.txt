Sunboat - Little Suns
One apple one parmfruit
The debouce to that road
Three children play loudly
A lonely song of ballet
Want you to be mine
I know is not fine
I know is not right
I know now is not the time
Wonder I say when is day
Get upon your life
Get upon your life
Let it be right
Let it be right
Let it be right
Let it be right
All around me people seems so happy
How can we be happy
One then know you are with me
Every night I see the way
See the way I dance all alone
Here may suddenly now
There is no doubting no no
With all the troubles
This world has going
Take me in your rowboat 'til
The suns not glowing
And when the world aint turning
I can be your sweet delight
