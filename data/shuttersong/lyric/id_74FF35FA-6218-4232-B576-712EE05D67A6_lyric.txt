I just can't live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Don't ask me why cause there are too many things

And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend, as your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend

And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend

I just can't live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Don't ask me why cause there are too many things

And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend, as your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
