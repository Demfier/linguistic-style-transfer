By three a.m. all the morning birds will be crying
And that old highway will be sighing
And my dreams feel as cold as my bones on the long walk home.

And my coat is old and growin thin
And my feet are numb and stumbling
And it's many the thought of a long lost friend
That comes to me again and again.

And I want to thank my Sarah Bell
Who blessed me more than words can tell and who
Picked me straight up out of hell
And I miss her real bad but I love her well.

And I remember Don Clancy as a wild young man
But I haven't seen hide nor hair of him since he lost his mind
And was born again off the coast of Oregon.

Oh where are you now, oh where are you now
And do you even think of me
I'm telling you now
You are the stars that I'll follow
Endlessly, endlessly, endlessly, oh

Well, I'm singin' this song but it won't take long.
On these frozen streets I'm half way home
And the sky above me forms a beautiful dome
Of blue and pink and starry gold.

Oh where are you now, oh where are you now
And do you even think of me
I'm telling you now
You are the stars that I'll follow
Endlessly, endlessly, endlessly, oh
