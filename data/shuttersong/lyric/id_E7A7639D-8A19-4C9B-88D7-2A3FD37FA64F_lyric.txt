They keep saying we don't know a thing
We're just kids pretending, love it's just a game
Oh, what do they know?
Saying that our love will stand a chance
They were just like us

Say they understand
Oh, but they don't know
They call it young love
And they don't take it serious
As if they know what's best for us

But we don't have to give it up

Wanna feel this way forever, young love

Wooh, wooh young love

Wooh
Wish that they just leave us here alone
To make our own mistakes, and learn it on our own
Oh, what do they know?
Consequences, I'll take what I get
Cause you were all I want
And I've got no regrets,
Oh, they'll never know
They call it young love
And they don't take it serious
As if they know what's best for us
But we don't have to give it up
Wanna feel this way forever, young love
Wooh, wooh, young love
Wooh, young love
Wooh, wooh, young love
Wooh
Do this right, I know we can do this right
I know we can do this right
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I know we can do this right (I know we can do this right)
I know we can do this right (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I know we can do this right (oh)
Yeah, yeah!
They call it young love
And they don't take it serious
As if they know what's best for us
But we don't have to give it up
Wanna feel this way forever, young love (wooh)
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, young love (wooh)
We'll feel the young love (wooh)
We'll feel this way forever
We'll feel this way forever, young love (wooh)
Oh, we're talking young love
