Heroes (Single Version) - David Bowie\n I I wish you could swim\n Like the dolphins like dolphins can swim\n Though nothing\n Nothing will keep us together\n We can beat them for ever and ever\n Oh we can be Heroes\n Just for one day\n I I will be king\n And you you will be queen\n Though nothing will drive them away\n We can be Heroes just for one day\n We can be us just for one day\n I I can remember I remember\n Standing by the wall by the wall\n And the guns shot above our heads\n Over our heads\n And we kissed\n As though nothing could fall\n Nothing could fall\n And the shame was on the other side\n Oh we can beat them for ever and ever\n Then we could be Heroes\n Just for one day\n We can be Heroes\n We can be Heroes\n We can be Heroes\n Just for one day
