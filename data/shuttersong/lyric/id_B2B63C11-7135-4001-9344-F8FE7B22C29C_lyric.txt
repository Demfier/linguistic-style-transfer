"Better Together"

[Lauren:]
When we were together
We were just strangers
I was just playing around
So I didn't wanna work it out
No, I didn't wanna work it out

[Normani:]
Thought something was missing
Were we too different
Baby I'm a-looking back now
And I really should've worked it out
Yeah, I really should've worked it out

[Dinah:]
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back 'cause I...

[All:]
Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,
You know we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,
You know we're better together

[Camila:]
I'm watching you with her, thinking I had you
How was I ever so dumb?
Boy I should've known that you're the one
Boy I should've known that you're the one

So, if it's not too late,
I just wanna know babe

[Normani:]
And tell me if we could still run
'Cause I finally know that you're the one
Yeah, I really know that you're the one
