When waters rise all around me
When mountains stand in the path I see
I look to love that's unfailing
I look to grace that is all I need

Oh call
Call upon the Name
Jesus Christ

The only Name that saves
For there is no one like our God
There's no one like our God
There's nothing that can stand against You
There's no stronghold You can't break
No life that You can't save

Our God You never fail

Your light will shine through the darkness
Your word will calm every crashing wave

My hope it lies in Your promise
My faith it stands on the empty grave

Oh Call
Call upon the Name

Jesus Christ
The Only Name that saves
For there is no one like our God
There's no one like our God
There's nothing that can stand against You
There's no stronghold You can't break
No life that You can't save
Our God You never fail
Strong through every trial
Faithful through the night
Our God will never fail
Our God will never fail
Anchor through the flood
You keep holding on
I know You'll never fail
Jesus You'll never fail

Oh call
Call upon the Name
Jesus Christ
The only Name that saves
Oh call
Call upon the Name
Jesus Christ
The only Name that Saves
For there is no one like our God
There's no one like our God
There's nothing that can stand against You

Our God You never fail

Strong through every trial
Faithful through the night
Our God will never fail
Our God will never fail
Anchor through the flood
