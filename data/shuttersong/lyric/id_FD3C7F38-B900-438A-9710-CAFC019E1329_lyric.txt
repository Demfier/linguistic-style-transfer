Take me to your side
Let me stay on the sidewalk
Traffic building up not a safe walk home
The luckiest girl on the planet
Luckily I saved some crackers in my pocket
Every nickle spent chasing jackpots
I'm... The luckiest girl on the planet
Talk to me now
Tell me what's wrong
How can I change if you go
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I care about
Give me something tonight
Give me something before I'll die
Write it down
Every second is a love song
Traffic building up walking through the cold
The luckiest girl on the planet
Some of them are blinded
Some are just lonely
Either way I can't let you be afraid
The luckiest girl on the planet
Talk to me now
Tell me what's wrong
How can I change if you go
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I care about
Give me something tonight
Give me something before I'll die
I will never be afraid if you'll stay
I promise I will never be afraid if you'll stay
I will never be afraid if you'll stay
I will never be afraid if you'll stay
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I care about
Give me something tonight
Give me something before I'll die
