You can take my heart for a walk on a beach
you can take my heart for a little trip
you can take my heart very close to your heart
you can take my heart forever if you like

But not every heart
belongs to any other
You and I
you and I
are meant to be
i'm the one for you
you're the one for me
you love me as much as I do
when you look at me
and we're skin to skin
I want you so
please come in
And you love me more and more
and my love grows up with you
and you kiss me more and more
and I kiss you too
and I kiss you too!

If I take your heart

I'll cherish it every day
If I take your heart
I'll heal these old wounds
If I take your heart
It's to make it happy
If I take your heart

It's forever close to mine

But not every heart
belongs to any other
You and I
you and I
are meant to be
I'm the one for you
you're the one for me
you love me as much as I do
when you look at me
and we're skin to skin
I want you so
please come in!
And you love me more and more

and my love grows up with you
And you kiss me more and more

and I kiss you too!
and I kiss you too!
I don't care, I don't care

if i'm again carried away
If you swear, if you swear
to give me your heart in return!
I don't care, I don't care
If i'm again carried away
If you swear, if you swear
to give me your heart in return
to give me your heart in return!
