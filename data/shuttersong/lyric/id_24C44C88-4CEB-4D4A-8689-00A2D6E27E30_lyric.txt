Boom boom boom clap.

You're picture perfect blue
Sunbathing on the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate.
First kiss no it was love
Under your influence
You take me over
You're the magic in my veins.

This must be love!
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap the make me feel good
Come on with me come on with me now.
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap the make me feel good
Come on with me come on with me now.
No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world.

Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
Going under cast a spell just say the world.
I feel your love!
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap the make me feel good

Come on with me come on with me now.

Come on with me come on with me now.
You are the light and I will follow
You let my lose my shadow
You are the sun the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up
With all of your love.
