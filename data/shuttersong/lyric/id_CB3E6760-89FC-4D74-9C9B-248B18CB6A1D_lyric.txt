It's a new day
But it all feels old
It's a good life
That's what I'm told
But everything
It all just feels the same

At my high school
It felt more to me
Like a jail cell
A penitentiary
My time spent there
(...)

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
You
Don't wanna be you

So it's a new day
But it's not the same
Cause you decided
(...)
(...)

You can gave up
I just canot lie
You can stand up
(...)

Go to college
A university
Get a real job
That's what they said to me

But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by
And just do my time
Out of step while
They all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
Do you really wanna be like them

Do you really wanna be another trend
Do you wanna be part of their drill
'Cause I don't ever wanna
I don't ever wanna be you

Don't wanna be just like you
Oh what I'm saying is
This is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
You
Don't wanna be you
Shake it once, that's fine

Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again
You
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm saying is

This is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me
Sing if you're with me
You
Don't wanna be just like you (be just like you)
This is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me
Sing if you're with me
Another loser anthem (whoa)
