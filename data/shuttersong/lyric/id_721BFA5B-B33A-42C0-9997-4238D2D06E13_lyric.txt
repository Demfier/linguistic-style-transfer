VERSE 1:
If ever I needed someone
It's you and now - oh
'Cause you bring out some feelings
More than the law will allow
I can be down
You pick me from the crowd
I thought I lost everything -
Then my mood swings...

CHORUS:
I haven't lost
What I can find in you
Baby...
You know just what to do (just what to do)
To make a friendship band (make a friendship band)
Turn to a diamond ring (turn to a diamond ring)
I simply touch your hand (I simply)
And my mood swings

VERSE 2:
In a vicious cycle of depression once
Not too long ago
But I'm over it now
Not a second too soon
You came and made light shine from the moon
Like there was nothing to it
Boy, I don't know how you do it

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
Lovin' you - it's an old cliche'
But it's like a dream come true every day
There's no other love in this world
Than the love you're getting
From this girl

'Cause if ever
I needed somebody
It's you and now
Thought I lost everything

Mood Swings

What I can find...

You make a friendship band
Turn to a diamond ring
I simply touch your hand
And my mood swings (mood swings)
