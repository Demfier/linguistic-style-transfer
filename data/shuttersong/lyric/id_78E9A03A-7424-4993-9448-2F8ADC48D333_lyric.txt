Wake up in the mornin' feeling like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth, with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back

I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryin' to get a little bit tipsy...

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are linin' up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger...

I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
Now, now we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us down

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me (uh, uh, uh)

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me (uh, uh, uh)

With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up!

Now, the party don't start till I walk in...

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh
