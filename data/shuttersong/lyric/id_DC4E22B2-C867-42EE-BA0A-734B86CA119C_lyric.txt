No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why
you had to go out of my door

and leave just like you did before
I know I said that I was sure
but rich man can't imagine poor
One day baby, we'll be old

Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories
that we could have told

So, one day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think of all the stories
that we could have told

Little me and little you
kept doing all the things they do
they never really think it throught
like I never think you're true

Here I go again
The blame, the guilt, the pain
the hurt, the shame

The founding fathers of our plane
that's stuck in heavy clouds of rain
One day baby, we'll be old

Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old

Oh baby, we'll be old
And think of all the stories that we could have told
I'll say it, one day baby, we'll be old

Oh baby, we'll be old
And think of all the stories that we could have told
I'll say it, one day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old, oh baby
we'll be old, sure baby we'll be old, oh baby, we'll be old
sure baby, we'll be old
oh baby, we'll be old
baby, we'll be old
baby, little beauty baby
really little baby, sure baby
beauty little baby, baby, baby
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
think of all the stories
that we could have told.
