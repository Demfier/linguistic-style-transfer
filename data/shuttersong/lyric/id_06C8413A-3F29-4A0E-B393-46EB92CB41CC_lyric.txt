Woo!
Yeah!
Yeah!

Why are you so pissed off
I can hear it through the wire
It's late now, why aren't you sleeping?
Shouldn't you be in bed?

Come on and state your case, don't leave me in the dark
I hear the silence on the line
Yeah, all those broken parts
I gave you the part of me

The only one that you could see
Tell me it doesn't mean a thing
Breathe in, breathe out

Someway, somehow
Say it all, say it now
Or don't say anything
All in, all out
Someway, somehow
Say it all, say it now
Or don't say anything
God, I hate this place

I hate the space between us
Lost in the grey unknown
There's still so far to go
I gave you the part of me

The only one that you could see
Tell me it doesn't mean a thing
Breathe in, breathe out

Someway, somehow
Say it all, say it now
Or don't say anything
All in, all out
Someway, somehow
Say it all, say it now
Or don't say anything (Don't say anything x3)
Oh, you're the sweetest thing
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na)
You're the sweetest thing
