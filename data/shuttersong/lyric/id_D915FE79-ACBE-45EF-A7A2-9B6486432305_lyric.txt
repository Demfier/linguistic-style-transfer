See you looking at me, feels like I'm in a dream
I don't wanna wake up, think we're meant to be
My heart skipping a beat to magic mystery
You know you're what I need

I know, I know
I got a feeling
I can't let go

Hey boy, tell me what you thinking
I can't wait until the weekend
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet
Hey boy, tell me what you thinking
I can't wait until the weekend
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet

Say yeah, I say yeah
(Oh oh oh) I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet
Say yeah, I say yeah
(Oh oh oh) I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet

Have been on earth with you take my breath away
No place I'd rather be, you're the only way
Done my heart on my sleeve, come on take the lead
Show me the best things are free

I know, I know
I got a feeling
I can't let go

Hey boy, tell me what you thinking (what you thinking)
I can't wait until the weekend (til the weekend)
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet
