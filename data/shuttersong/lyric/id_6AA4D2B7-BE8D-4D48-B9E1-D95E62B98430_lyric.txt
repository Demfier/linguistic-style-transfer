We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (Leaving Ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown
The final countdown
Ohh

We're heading for Venus
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all, yea
With so many light years to go
And things to be found
(To be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so

It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown
(The final countdown)
Oohh ho ohhh

(guitar solo)

The final countdown, oh ho
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown
(The final countdown)
Ohh

It's the final countdown
We're leaving together
The final countdown
We'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown
(The final countdown)
Ohh,
It's the final countdown
