Aint' never felt this way
Can't get enough so stay with me
It's not like we got big plans
Let's drive around town holding hands

And ya need to know
You're the only one—alright, alright
And ya need to know
That ya keep me up all night, all night

Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe—so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe—so bad, so bad

Mad cool in all my clothes
Mad warm when you get close…to me
Slow dance these summer nights
Our disco ball's my kitchen light

And ya need to know
That nobody could take your place, your place
And ya need to know
That I'm hella obsessed with your face, your face

Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe—so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart is so good
I love you, babe—so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart is so good
I love you, babe—so bad, so bad…oh

And ya need to know
You're the only one—alright, alright
And ya need to know
That ya keep me up all night, all night

My heart hurts so good
I love you, babe—so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart is so good
I love you, babe—so bad, so bad…oh
So bad, oh
Oh, my heart hurt…
