I was walkin' down the street
When out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said I never seen a man
Who looked so all alone
Could you use a little company
And if you pay the right price
Your evening sill be nice
You can go and send me on my way
I said you're such a sweet young thing
Why you do this to yourself
She looked at me and this is what she said
*There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay
I got mouths to feed
Ain't nothing in this world for free
I know can't slow down
I can't hold back
Though you know I wish I could
No there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until you close our eyes for good*
Not even 15 minutes later
I'm still walkin' down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight
And then he swept up from behind
He put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't lookin' for a fight
He said give me all you got
I want your money not your life
But if you try to make amove I won't thind twice
I told him you can have my cash
But first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life
He said there aint no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay
I got mouths to feed
Ain't nothing in this world for free
I know can't slow down
I can't hold back
Though you know I wish I could
No there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until you close our eyes for good*
Well now a couple hours past
And I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and comming to an end
So I turned on theTV
And flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs
He'd taken money from the church
He'd stuff his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much
Because I know we're all the same
Oh yes we all seed out to satisfy those thrills
There aint no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay
We got mouths to feed
Ain't nothing in this world for free
We can't slow down
We can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
No there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until you close our eyes for good*
