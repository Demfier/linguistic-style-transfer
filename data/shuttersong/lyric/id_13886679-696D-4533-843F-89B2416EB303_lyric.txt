See we gotta get it right
But we always get it wrong
And it be the same old thing
And it be the same old song
Tryin' to fight to survive
Tryin' to fight for our lives
See
I'm only tryin' to live
I don't want to say goodbye
But the day that it all should end
Holla back some more that be

Cause we'll all be born again
Maybe then we'll all be free
And the day that it all should stop
Is a day that will never come
Cause we gonna live forever
Spinnin' until we're spun
Here we go one more time

Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Now we spun
Here we go one more time
Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'

Yeah we spinnin'
Now we spun
See we got nowhere to run
And we got no where to go
True love is all I need
And to never to be alone
So I take a sip and chill

While I take a dip and chew
Lookin' for a quick escape
But it all wears off too soon
All the girls they love to lie
Some girls I'll never trust
But it's all a compromise
Maybe I expect too much
Maybe if I close my eyes
Maybe then I'll finally see
Maybe then I'll finally die

Maybe I'll be finally free
Here we go one more time
Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin
Yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Now we spun
Here we go one more time
Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Now we spun
My superstition got me wishin' for another life
And if I don't listen I ain't gonna make it through another night
And the pills 'n the caine and the drink and the drugs got me floating above
And the girls and cash the cars and the hash got me feelin' a rush
A thousand voices in my head I don't know right from wrong
I'm breakin' down holdin' on I'm livin' song to song
And Pipe you're my brother 'till the day that we die
I don't give a fuck who hears me cause I ain't gonna lie
So roll it up pour a cup drink it up smoke it up I don't give a fuck
We bout to blow this shit up
Here we go one more time
Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Now we spun
Here we go one more time
Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Now we spun
