Don't look at me
Mmmm, Ohhh, Yeah, Yeah, Oh
Everyday is so wonderful then suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure, from all the pain
Feel so ashamed
I am beautiful, no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful, in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
Oh, no

So don't you bring me down today
Mmmmmmm
To all your friends, you're delirious

So consumed in all your doom
Ooh, ooh, mmm
Trying hard to fill the emptiness, the piece is gone
Left the puzzle undone, ain't that the way it is?
'Cause you are beautiful, no matter what they say

Words can't bring you down
No, no
'Cause you are beautiful, in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down
Oh, no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do
(No matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(No matter what we say)
We're the song that's out of tune

Yeah, full of beautiful mistakes
Oh, yeah
And everywhere we go
(And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
(The sun will always, always, shine)
'Cause we are beautiful, no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down
Oh, no
We are beautiful, in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no
So don't you bring me down today
Mm, yeah, don't you bring me down today
Yeah, yeah, ooh
Don't you bring me down, ooh, today
