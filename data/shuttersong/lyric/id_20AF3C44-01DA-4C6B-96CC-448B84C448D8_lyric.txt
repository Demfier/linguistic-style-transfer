It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it; you were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember; you try to feel the beat

Eee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-
Eet eet eet
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-
Eet eet eet

You spend half of your life trying to fall behind
You're using your headphones to drown out your mind
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember; you try to move your feet

Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-
Eet eet eet.
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-
Eet eet eet.

[musical interlude]

Someone's deciding whether or not to steal
He opens a window just to feel the chill
He hears that outside a small boy just started to cry
'Cause it's his turn, but his brother won't let him try
