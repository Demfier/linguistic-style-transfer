"Waves (Robin Schulz Remix)"(Ft: Chris Brown & T.I.)

Hustle Gang over everything, yeah, uh huh

Drifting away

Hey, hol' up, my paranoia getting worse and my anxiety high

Mind got me staying in the eye of the fire

Sometimes I don't know if I'mma drown or fly

Heart so big I be down to die

For all the ones I love, too bad they don't think I really love 'em

They don't understand that there just so many of 'em

Hustle's got so many of 'em, everybody pulling at me

Can't leave the house without everybody looking at me

Hm, had a dream last night

That my wife was at my wake, with my son, he said "Look at daddy"

Something got me thinking this might be the end

But if it is you gon' wish for a G when I'm gone

Drifting away, wave after wave, wave after wave

And my feet can't touch the ground,

I can see the sands on the horizon

Every time you are not around

I'm slowly drifting away, drifting away, wave after wave, wave after wave

I'm slowly drifting, drifting away

And it feels like I'm drowning

Pulling against the stream, pulling against the wave

This might be the end, but if it is you gon' wish for a G when I'm gone

Drifting away, drifting, drifting away

Drifting away, drifting, drifting away

Drifting away, drifting, drifting away

Drifting away, drifting, drifting away

I wish I could make it easy

Easy to love me, love me

But still I reach, to find a way, I'm stuck here in between

I'm looking for the right words to say

I'm slowly drifting away, wave after wave, wave after wave

I'm slowly drifting, drifting away

And it feels like I'm drowning

Pulling against the stream, pulling against the
