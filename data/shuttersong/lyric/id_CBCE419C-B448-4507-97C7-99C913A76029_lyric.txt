Girl you, hit me harder than a freight train
Right in the middle of my membrane
Driving backwards in the fast lane
Headlights off after midnight
Saw you shinning in the starlight
Girl you got me like a bug bite
And now you're under my skin

And I know, you know, I don't know which way to go to lose you
To get away from you girl

Lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Just get out, get out, get out, get out

Play me, like boy you never gonna get me
You're just lucky that you met me
I'll make sure you don't forget me again
And I don't what I would do if I was without you
Even though I am, I'm always thinking about you
Spending all my waking time forgetting about you
But you're under my skin

And I know, you know, I don't know which way to go to lose you
To get away from you girl

And lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
G-g-get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart

And I'm lying alone in my bed
Wondering why love makes me feel like I'm dead
Baby, you gave me a taste now I'm wasted

Lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you

Oh, lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Just get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
