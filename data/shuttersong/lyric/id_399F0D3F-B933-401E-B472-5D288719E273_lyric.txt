All the lies don't hold me, but they're sinking in my skin, coursing through my veins

And the truth eludes me, losing sight of it again

Save me from myself

Close my eyes, see my life

Have I lost my way?

I hope this is the last time

Am I here to stay?

Nowhere left to hide

There's always a way to find the reason in a moment

There is truth inside me but it feels out of reach

Will it come to me?

And you'll walk beside me

I'll see things that you see

Will you wait for me?

Close my eyes, see my life

Have I lost my way?

I hope this is the last time

Am I here to stay?

Nowhere left to hide

There's always a way to find the reason in a moment

Save your future for me

Save your time

Save your future for me

Save my life

Close my eyes, see my life

Have I lost my way?

I hope this is the last time

Am I here to stay?

Nowhere left to hide

There's always a way to find the reason in a moment
