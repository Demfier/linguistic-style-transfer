Been thinking about all the days you were
Right by my side
Been thinking about how you never
Left me behind

And all of the things that you said to
Help me ease my mind
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you in my life

Now I just wanna tell you how much
I appreciate your love

So I'll be there when you call
Pick you up when you fall
And if you ever get lonely
I'll be there in a heartbeat

This song is for you
For everything we've been through
It's been so long overdue
I just wanna say
Thank you

Been travelling this road for so long
Still going strong
'Cause without you here I'd be nothing
Nothing at all

Even when times were bad you believed in me
And now I'm standing tall
And I just wanna thank you
For sticking through it all

Now I just wanna show you how much
I appreciate your love

So I'll be there when you call
Pick you up when you fall
And if you ever get lonely
I'll be there in a heartbeat

This song is for you
For everything we've been through
It's been so long overdue
I just wanna say
Thank you.

I know it's not easy
But you were there from the start
I'll take the kindness you've shown me
Share the love and the strength
Pay it forward
And all we can be

So I'll be there when you call
Pick you up when you fall
And if you ever get lonely
I'll be there in a heartbeat

This song is for you
For everything we've been through
It's been so long overdue
I just wanna say
Thank you.
So I'll be there when you call
Pick you up when you fall
And if you ever get lonely
I'll be there in a heartbeat
This song is for you
For everything we've been through
It's been so long overdue
I just wanna say
Thank you.
