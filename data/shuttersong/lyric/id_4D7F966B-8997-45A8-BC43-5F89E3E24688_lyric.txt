You walk into a discotheque,
and what do think you get
Well I tell you what, it's music,
that's what you get

Now you dance until you're soakin' wet
And your legs are getting weak
So you sit down for a little rest
Till you're back on your feet and then
You do the boogie once again

Melody lines attacking your sweet head
Cool chords gonna blow you away
Ain't no treat like a voodoo beat
I said hey, Music is here to stay

You wanna take a fast ride,
so you get into your car
You feel like Johnny Angelo,
cruising the boulevard

But something is missing,
it's quiet as in a grave

So you put on some music,
and then it's okey and then,
You take another ride again

Melody lines attacking your sweet head
Cool chords gonna blow you away
Ain't no treat like a voodoo beat
I said hey, Music is here to stay

Melody lines attacking your sweet head
Cool chords gonna blow you away
Ain't no treat like a voodoo beat
I said hey, Music is here to stay

Melody lines attacking your sweet head
Cool chords gonna blow you away
Ain't no treat like a voodoo beat
I said hey, Music is here to stay
