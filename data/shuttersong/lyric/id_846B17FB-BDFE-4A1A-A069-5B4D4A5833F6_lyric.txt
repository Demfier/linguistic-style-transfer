 Ariana Grande& Big Sean
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
Then put your hands up (put your hands up)
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
Then put your hands up (put your hands up)
You got it 每 you got, baby
You got it 每 you got, baby
You got it 每 you got, baby
Boy, you make me feel lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy
To be in love and give you this heart of mine
You know what I mean? I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so  right?
Yeah, I really need you, I really love you
And I＊ll never let you go＃
You should know I＊m never gonna change
I＊m always gonna stay
You come for me  right  there ( right  there)
 Right  there ( right  there)
＆Cause you listen, and you care
You＊re so different, no one compares
And if you＊ll never change, I＊m gonna stay  right  there
I＊ll always be  right  there＃
You got it 每 you got, baby
You got it 每 you got, baby
And I can＊t put a price, just thinkin＊
About you boy, you＊re on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreamin＊
Lost in your eyes, and I lose all track of time
You know what I mean? I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so  right?
Yeah, I really need you, I really love you
And I＊ll never let you go＃
You should know I＊m never gonna change
I＊m always gonna stay
You come for me  right  there ( right  there)
 Right  there ( right  there)
＆Cause you listen, and you care
You＊re so different, no one compares
And if you＊ll never change, I＊m gonna stay  right  there
I＊ll always be  right  there＃
Now if all fell through
Would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting?
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book, and numbers thicker than a dictionary
And Bible, I＊ve got to recycle, I love and I like you
Five course meals even though you don＊t mind a drive-thru
That＊s why I got you
I＊m never gonna
I gonna...
You should know I＊m never gonna change
I＊m always gonna stay
You come for me  right  there ( right  there)
 Right  there ( right  there)
＆Cause you listen, and you care
You＊re so different, no one compares
And if you＊ll never change, I＊m gonna stay  right  there
I＊ll always be  right  there＃
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
Then put your hands up (put your hands up)
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
Then put your hands up (put your hands up)
You got it 每 you got, baby......
