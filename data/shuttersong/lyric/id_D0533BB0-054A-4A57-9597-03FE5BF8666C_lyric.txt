I've been lying here alone in the dark
and it's five in the morning
Everybody tells me I'm insane but
I'm ignoring the warnings
And it's not like I'm having a terrible time
but I can't seem to get you out of my mind
Though I know we're fine for now I'm sad to say that the curtains are closing

So you call me 20 times
worried that I'll that I'll find
somebody else
But it's just me and me and me and me and the ceiling
it's rainy and it's cold and
that was always our favorite weather
No matter how,, how much it stormed
we'd always weather the weather together
And I know that I only have myself to blame
for falling in love and then leaving again
and it doesn't help at all that I promised I‘d be yours forever

So you call me 20 times
worried that I'll that I'll find
somebody else
But it's just me and me and me and me and the ceiling

Did I do the right thing coming here?
It should be exciting but all I wanna hear…
Is you calling 20 times
saying that you'll never find
somebody else
and its' just me and me and me and me and the ceiling

So I hope that you don't mind
if I call you every night
like you're here by my side
but it's just me and me and me and me and the ceiling
oh it's just me and me and me and me and the ceiling
