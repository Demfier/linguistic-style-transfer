It's late at night
I'm still awake
Though I'm a scientist (scientist)
No need to analyze this

I will remember this for sure
This very night that changed it all
You stroked my thigh and made me fall in love again
Your burning eyes have asked for more
One secret kiss and I will go
But then you followed me and placed your heart in my hand
Your heart in my hand
Your heart in my hand
Your heart in my hand

I will remember this for sure
When we were standing at the bathroom door
Your face so close to mine before we both nearly gave in
Allow our hungry hearts to love
Leave it to powers above
I was too scared to let it happen and too scared to begin

Who would have known that this moment would echo in my heart
Ever since, ever since we almost touched
We almost loved
We almost touched
We almost loved

Do you remember this at all?
When you revealed your wounds and scars
It was the act of your sincerity that melted my heart
So I embrace whatever there has been
Inhale the smell of your skin
And then I realize that this was the beginning of love
