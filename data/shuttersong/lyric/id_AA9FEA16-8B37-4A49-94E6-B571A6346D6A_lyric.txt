Flashlight - Jessie J\n When tomorrow comes\n I'll be on my own\n Feeling frightened up\n The things that I don't know\n When tomorrow comes\n Tomorrow comes\n Tomorrow comes\n And though the road is long\n I look up to the sky\n And in the dark I found  I stop and I won't fly\n And I sing along  I sing along  then I sing along\n I got all I need when I got you and I\n I look around me  and see sweet life\n I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight\n You're gettin' me  gettin' me through the night\n Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes\n Can't lie  it's a sweet life\n I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight\n You're gettin' me  gettin' me through the night\n Cause you're my flash light\n You're my flash light  you're my flash light\n I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top\n I'm not afraid when the rain won't stop\n Cause you light the way\n You light the way  you light the way\n I got all I need when I got you and I\n I look around me  and see sweet life\n I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight\n You're gettin' me  gettin' me through the night\n Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes\n Can't lie  it's a sweet life\n I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight\n You're gettin' me  gettin' me through the night\n Light light you're my flash light\n Light light you're my flash light\n Light light you're my flash light\n You're my flash\n Oh\n I got all I need when I got you and I\n I look around me  and see sweet life\n I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight\n You're gettin' me  gettin' me through the night\n Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes\n Can't lie  it's a sweet life\n I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight\n You're my flash light\n Gettin' me through the night\n Cause you're my flash light\n Cause you're my flash light\n You're my flash light\n You're my flash light light light\n You're my flash light light light yeah yeah\n You're my flash light
