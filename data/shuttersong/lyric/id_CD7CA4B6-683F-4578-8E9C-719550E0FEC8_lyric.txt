The lights change on the hill
The air seems strangely still
Everyone s asleep
The floorboards creak at dawn
As you walk out on the lawn
The grass is wet beneath
You think it rather strange
You think it rather weird
It s fair to say that

Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here

The phone is off the hook
As you sink into a book
You don t know where you are
From the world; detached
Unto a girl you latched
It never got too far
And everybody talks
And everybody stares
It s safe to say that

Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here
And everybody's down
And everybody cares

You knew your day to shine
Would come without you here
Come without you here...
Nothing was keeping you here
Nothing is keeping you here
