I can't stop, never let a hater
Kill your dreams, 19, I got paper
Katniss Everdeen, odds always in my favor
I pull up on the scene, black tee and a blazer
Won't chase a woman, I'll re-place her
Make ya have deja vu when I walk by
Like, "Hey it's that guy! Yeah aren't you from Vine?"
Hell nah I'm from Nebraska, get your facts aligned
But I ain't gonna lie, Jack and Jack
Did blow up on the app but we're more than that
The best duo in LA since Kobe-Shaq
They need a whole demolition just to hold us back
Run circles around the competition, cul-de-sacs
Legs keep burnin' but it's so worth it
When you're young and earning, money like a surgeon
Yeah it's cool and all but spreadin' love's my purpose

So who's gone tell me I can't do
Anything I put my mind to
Now I ain't tryna hear it
Bitch get up out my ear
I'm just a...
Midwest kid dreamin' California
One way ticket cause I had to show yah
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
¡°


No way, no way

Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home

No way
I'm fresh up in the game and I'm here to stay
Don't really got my shit together, just appear this way
and I'm like everybody else, I got fears to face
Nowadays even the real are just the realist fakes
And nobody's really what they seem
Learned that the hard way, cuts run deep
And these millions of people put their trust in me
Man I got a lot of pressure but I must succeed
So I'ma keep grindin' and workin', I'm finally certain
My life is not meant to be wasted

The line of success all these people be tracin'
That shit, it ain't me, I'ma pay my own way

And I'm a little unorthodox, I can't lie

No I ain't gonna conform I rock, my own style
Shout out to the fans and everybody by our side

Yo we're headed to the top and you should keep a close eye out for us
So who's gone tell me I can't do
Anything I put my mind to
Now I ain't tryna hear it
Bitch get up out my ear

I'm just a...
Midwest kid dreamin' California
One way ticket cause I had to show yah

Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia

I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home

No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home

No way, no way

Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home

No way
Before I touched down, thought I had it all
Now it's midnight sessions, playin' basketball
My friends and my family, I'ma have to call
And tell 'em I'm never goin' home,
Yeah I'm never goin' home
No way
Midwest kid dreamin' California
One way ticket cause I had to show yah
Flow so sick, make you catch pneumonia
I'm never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way, no way
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way (no way), No way (no way)
Never goin' home, n-n-never goin' home
No way
