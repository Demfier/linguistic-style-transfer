You and I, we're like fireworks

And symphonies exploding in the sky
With you, I'm alive

Like all the missing pieces of my heart
They finally collide

So stop time right here in the moonlight

Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

Without you, I feel broken
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold

Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
I'm just a sad song
With you, I fall
It's like I'm leaving all my past

And silhouettes up on the wall
With you, I'm a beautiful mess

It's like we're standing had and hand
With all our fears up on the edge
So stop time right here in the moonlight
Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes
Without you, I feel broken
Like I'm half of a whole

Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
You're the perfect melody

The only harmony I wanna to hear
You're my favorite part of me
With you standing next to me
I've got nothing to fear
Without you, I feel broken
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
Without you, I feel broken
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
