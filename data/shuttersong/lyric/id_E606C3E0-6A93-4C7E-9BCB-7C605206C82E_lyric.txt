No ceilings you can see who's in it
If talking about sex 
Girl you know I invented that
And your mom don't know that
Just like bring a friend
Who with it 
Oh  I'm sorry  Oh  you mad
That I came to the party 
Like  no no no  you took your girl
To the club
And now she gone
Now she asking me
When I'm taking her 
Home  home  home
I tell her "let's go"
Long as you know  cause I know 
When we get it on
I'm touchin' you tonight 
I'm lovin' you tonight (Wait nope)

Oh-oh-oh  and if they living right next 
Then I bet they know my name in a minute
(Trigga) Let me feel your body sweating 
I promise I'll keep your body dripping
Oh  I'm sorry  niggas mad
'Cause I came to the party 
Like  oh no no 
You took your girl to the club
And now she gone
Now she asking me
When I'm taking her  home  home  home

Cause I know  when we get it on
I'm touchin' you tonight

Sometimes I tell 'em I love 'em
Because I just wanna fuck 'em
I never love 'em  I cuff 'em
And when we done I'mma duck 'em
He Ferragamo the buckle 
He Louis V on the duffel
The pussy is wetter than puddles 
I ride his dick like a shuttle
I said real niggas let real bitches come first
And real bitches been bad bitches from birth
Uh  k-k-kiss him when he coming
M-m-make more money last year
Than Mister Drummond
Oh-oh-oh  he like it when I ride it slow
