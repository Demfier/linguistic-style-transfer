Lane Boy - Twenty One Pilots\n They say stay in your lane boy  lane boy\n But we go where we want to\n They think this thing is a highway  highway\n But will they be alive tomorrow \n They think this thing is a highway\n If it was our way\n We'd have a tempo change every other time change\n Cause our minds change on what we think is good\n I wasn't raised in the hood\n But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness\n If it wasn't for this music\n I don't know how I would've fought this\n Regardless  all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless\n Don't trust a perfect person\n And don't trust a song that's flawless\n Honest  there's a few songs\n On this record that feel common\n I'm in constant confrontation\n With what I want and what is poppin'\n In the industry it seems to me\n That singles on the radio are currency\n My creativity is on the free when I'm playin' shows\n They say stay in your lane boy  lane boy\n But we go where we want to\n They think this thing is a highway  highway\n But will they be alive tomorrow \n They be alive tomorrow\n I'm sorry if that question I asked last\n Scared you a bit like a hazmat\n In a gas mask\n If you ask Zack\n He's my brother  he likes when I rap fast\n But let's back track  back to this\n Who would you live and die for on that list\n But the problem is\n There's another list that exist\n And no one really think about this\n Forget sanity  forget salary  forget vanity  my morality\n If you get in between someone I love and me\n You're gonna feel the heat of my calvary\n All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless\n Don't trust a perfect person\n And don't trust a song that's flawless\n They say stay in your lane boy  lane boy\n But we go where we want to\n They think this thing is a highway  highway\n But will they be alive tomorrow \n They say stay in your lane boy  lane boy\n But we go where we want to\n They think this thing is a highway  highway\n But will they be alive tomorrow \n But will they be alive tomorrow \n But will they be alive tomorrow\n Will they be alive tomorrow\n Will they be alive tomorrow\n They say stay in your lane boy  lane boy\n But we go where we want to\n They think this thing is a highway  highway\n But will they be alive tomorrow \n They say stay in your lane boy  lane boy\n But we go where we want to\n They think this thing is a highway  highway\n But will they be alive tomorrow
