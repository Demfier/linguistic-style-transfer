What's your favorite color
Do you remember when you realized
What's your favorite summer
Do you remember how it crystallized
Now you're in love with the world
As long as you're alive
In love with it all
As long as you survive
In love with the world
Once you close your eyes enough
What's your favorite song
Do you remember how it pierced your ears
And those memories
How they resonate for years
Now I'm in love with the world
As long as you're alive
In love with it all
As long as you survive
In love with the world
Once I close my eyes enough
Will you hold your breath
Will you do your best
Will you hold your breath
Will you do your best
Now we're in love with the world
As long as we're alive
In love with it all
As long as we survive
In love with the world
Once we close our eyes enough
