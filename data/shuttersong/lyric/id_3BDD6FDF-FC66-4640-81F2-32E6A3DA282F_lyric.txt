Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care
At all
You been out all night, I don't know where you been
You're slurring all your words
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care
At all
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care
At all
Oh, oh, oh
Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
Cause I don't fucking care
You been out all night
I don't know where you been
you're slurring all your words
don't making any sense
Cause I don't fuckin care, at all
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care
At all
Oh, oh, oh
