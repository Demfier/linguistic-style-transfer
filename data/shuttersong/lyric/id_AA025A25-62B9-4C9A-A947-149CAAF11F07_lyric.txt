Alejandro (Dave Aud√© Remix) - Lady GaGa
She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you
Won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She got a halo around her finger
Around you
You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico  rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name
Don't call my name 
Don't call my name 
Don't call my name  Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe  Fernando
Don't wanna kiss  don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name  Roberto

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like a dad  just like a dad
And all those flames that burned  before him
Now he's gonna fire fight  gotta cool the bad
You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico  rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name
Don't call my name  Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe  Fernando
Don't wanna kiss  don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name  Roberto
