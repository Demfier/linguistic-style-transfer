The glory of a nation dies
The symbol of this war is coming
A warning meant to save our lives from
F.E.A.R.'s religion

Out of the depths we crawled to light
Never give in when the fire rises
Standing here we are unified
Our hearts bear crosses

Can't turn back now

We are, we are the revelation
So scream it out loud
We are, we are the birth of a nation
So join as one
It's time to raise our flags up high
We are, we are the revelation
So scream it out loud

(Woah oh, woah oh)
The sound of a nation
(Woah oh, woah oh)

There are no stars in the sky
No sight of what was freedom
Where do we turn when our brothers die
In a fight worth winning?

We are legions mesmerized
By the fools that killed our vision
Won't stray or apologize
For their decisionCan't turn back now

We are, we are the revelation
So scream it out loud
We are, we are the birth of a nation
So join as one
It's time to raise our flags up high
We are, we are the revelation
So scream it out loud

(Woah oh, woah oh)
The sound of a nation
(Woah oh, woah oh)
The sound of a nation

Can't turn back now

We are, we are the revelation
So scream it out loud
We are, we are the birth of a nation
So join as one
It's time to raise our flags up high
We are, we are the revelation
So scream it out loud

(Woah oh, woah oh)
The sound of a nation
(Woah oh, woah oh)
The sound of a nation
