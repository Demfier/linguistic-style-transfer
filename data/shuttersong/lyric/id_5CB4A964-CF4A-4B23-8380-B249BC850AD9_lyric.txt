Behold our beloved revels,
In tragedy,
(In tragedy)
Self denying avarice for bloodshed,
Behold,
Hypocrite,
Those who run,
Will be burned,
Those who run,
Will be burned,
Those who run,
Will be burned,
Those who run,
Will be burned,
Devoutly wished for blinded eyes,
This tragedy's like light to flies,
It seems to suit you better,
Bleeding out the eyes,
(Bleeding out the eyes)
hopes left in chain suspension,
Holding onto lies to make the truth,
