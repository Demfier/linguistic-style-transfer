Harry: You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be but a test of faith
Made it so we had to walk away

Niall: 'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
Zayn: We're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

All: I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so c'mon

Harry: Baby be with me so happily
Liam: It's four AM and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
Louis: And if he feels my traces in your hair

Sorry, love, but I don't really care
Niall: 'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
Zayn: We're on fire, we are on fire

We're on fire now
All: I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever

I know you wanna leave so c'mon

Liam: Baby be with me so happily
So happily
All: Oh oh oh oh
We're on fire now
Oh oh oh oh
We're on fire now

Oh oh oh oh
We're on fire now
All: I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so c'mon baby be with me so happily
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so c'mon
Harry: Baby be with me so happily
