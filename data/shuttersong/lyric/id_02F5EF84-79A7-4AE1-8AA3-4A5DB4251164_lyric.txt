We broke up, yeah, it's tough
Most guys would've been crushed
Wasting their time wondering where they went wrong
No way, not me, hey, I'm doing just fine
I'm not afraid of moving on

It's easy going out on Friday night
Easy every time I see her out
I can smile, live it up the way a single guy does
But what she, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so easy

The truth is, I miss lyin' in those arms of his
But I don't ever let it show
I laugh and I act like I'm havin' the time of my life
As far as he knows

It's easy going out on Friday night
Easy every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up the way a single girl does
But what he, what he don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so easy
Oh, it's easy, yeah

Oh, it's easy going out on Friday night
Oh, it's easy every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up, forget about the way it was
But what she, oh what he don't know, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so easy

Oh, look so easy
Look so easy
Yeah, ooh
