Start spreading the news
I am leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I wanna wake up, in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

This little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York

If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up in that city
That never sleeps
And find I'm hey number one
Top of the list
King of the hill
Hey number one

These are little town blues
They have all melted away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York
And I
If I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York, New York
