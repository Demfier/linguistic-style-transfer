I don't know where you're going but do you got
Room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I'll say
I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin
And we started at the end

Say it
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say it
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

Cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion
They love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful
Do you wanna, yeah

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck now, I'm up next
Tonight I'm hired to burn the check

'Cause I don't know where you're going but do you got
Room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going but I don't think
I'm coming home
And I'll say
I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin
And we started at the end

Say it
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say it
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

My heart is like a stallion
They love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful
Do you wanna, yeah
I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck now, I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, yeah

Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say it
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young

I don't know where you're going but do you got
