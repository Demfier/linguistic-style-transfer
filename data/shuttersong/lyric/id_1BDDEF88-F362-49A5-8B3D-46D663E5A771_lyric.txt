 I hate to tell you this
 You taught me how  to hit the mark
And once again  I missed Touch the fire
 You always said that  I'd get burned
Why is it so hard
 To remember all the lessons  I have learned
How can  you look at me that way
When  I have failed so many times
Showing me love,  you  tell the world
 This child is mine
How can  you walk that extra mile
 I see forgiveness in your smile
So sure  you'd reject me
Wrong again Once again
Lord,  I have wandered from your path
Thought  I knew a better way
Coming short of what  you've asked
Standing here
 I don't deserve a second chance
And  I can't conceal
The shame  I feel
It's more than  I can stand
How can  you look at me that way
When  I have failed so many times
Showing me love,  you  tell the world
 This child is mine
How can  you walk that extra mile
 I see forgiveness in your smile
So sure  you'd desert me
Wrong again 
When  I look into your face
And see the power of your grace
 I find it so hard  to believe
Forgiveness that your showing me
 I see the answer in your eyes
Love and mercy realized
And finally your truth has set me free
How can  you look at me that way
When  I have failed so many times
Showing me love,  you  tell the world
 This child is mine
How can  you walk that extra mile
 I see forgiveness in your smile  I thought  you would scold me
Instead  you just hold me
Thought  you would judge me
Instead  you just love me
So sure  you'd reject me
Wrong again
