Brady (ROSS LYNCH):
Yeah
Come on

You and me are meant to be
Like a brand new board and an awesomest wave
Thing is honey I'm your need
For every chilling and trying to catch some waves
Without you i sing the blues
Instead of rock rock rock rock rock and roll
So I'm hoping you miss me too
lately down to do whatever since I road the moan

March to the beat (Ohhh)
I march to the beat gonna do my thing
March to the beat (Ohhh)
I march to the beat gonna do my thing

Come on and feel this beat cause I gotta be me
You let em move those feet and they'll set you free
Come on you need to see that I gotta be me
I gotta be gotta be gotta gotta be me

Come on and feel this beat cause I gotta be me
You let em move those feet and they'll set you free
Come on you need to see that I gotta be me
I gotta be gotta be gotta gotta be me

Mack (MAIA MITCHELL):

Like you I'm original
Trying to move this world from where it's set
You're laid back and I get stressed
Yet whenever were together we're more than that
My motto sees the day and night
And yours is let's go with the flow
That's no reason we say goodbye
Now if your fast enough for a girl on the go

March to the beat (Ohhh)
I march to the beat gonna do my thing
March to the beat (Ohhh)
I march to the beat gonna do my thing

Come on and feel this beat cause I gotta be me
You let em move those feet and they'll set you free
Come on you need to see that I gotta be me
I gotta be gotta be gotta gotta be me
Come on and feel this beat cause i gotta be me
You let em move those feet and they'll set you free
Come on you need to see that I gotta be me
I gotta be gotta be gotta gotta be me

March to the beat
I march to the beat gonna do my thing
March to the beat
I march to the beat gonna do my thing

Come on and feel this beat cause I gotta be me
You let em move those feet and they'll set you free
Come on you need to see that I gotta be me
I gotta be gotta be gotta gotta be me
Come on and feel this beat cause i gotta be me
You let em move those feet and they'll set you free
Come on you need to see that I gotta be me
I gotta be gotta be gotta gotta be me
