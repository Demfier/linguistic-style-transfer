I know you want, I know you want to take it slo-o-ow
Think about all the places we could go-o-ow
If you give in tonight, just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key

'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?

Lets take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?

Say the word, say the word, but don't say no-o-o
Sky dive you and I with just these cloth-o-es
Your secret's safe with me, just don't write time or place
'Cause anyone could see, through it anyways

'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?

Lets take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?

Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away
I want to get addicted to you, yeah
You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted, don't say \
