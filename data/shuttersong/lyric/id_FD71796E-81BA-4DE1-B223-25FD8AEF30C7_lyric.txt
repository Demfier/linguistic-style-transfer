See the Pyramids
Along the Nile
Watch the sun rise

On a tropic isle
Just remember darling
All the while
You belong to me...

See the market place
In old Algiers
Send me photographs
And souvenirs
Just remember
'Til your dream appears
You belong to me...

I'll be so alone
Without you
Maybe
You'll be lonesome, too
And blue

Fly the ocean
In a silver plane
See the jungle
When it's wet with rains
Just remember
Till you're home again
You belong to me
