"You've Got A Friend In Me"
(originally by Randy Newman)

You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
Just remember what your old pal said
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You got troubles girl I got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together, we see it through
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
But none of them
Will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you

And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me, I said
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me now
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me now
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me now
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
