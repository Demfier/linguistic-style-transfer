When I thought that my whole world had ended
The colors have faded to grey
Just I had given up on hoping
The feelings they rushed back again

There's a bright light in the sky tonight
Guiding us safely to shore
Not afraid anymore

All that matters now
It's where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
Find out all we are is all that matters, is all that matters

Remember all you've forgotten
Enjoy in the simplest of things
Fewer take life for granted
But yours you're still brighting all the light brings

There's a bright light in the sky tonight
Guiding us safely to shore
Not afraid anymore

All that matters now
It's where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
Find out all we are is all that matters

There's a bright light in the sky tonight
Guiding us safely to shore
Not afraid anymore
All that matters now
It's where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
Find out all we are is all that matters, is all that matters
There's an easier way if we live for today
Find out all we are is all that matters
