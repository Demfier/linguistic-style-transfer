[Verse]
Some only want some shelter
Someone a mansion in the sky
Some want a thousand virgins
Some move battle with their mind

And when all the worlds collide
All they know is too divide
And it's easy if their faceless
To hate the other side
And the others caught between
Are the only ones to bleed
And the ones they leave behind
Can only sit and cry

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Mohammed
Can we just get along
Can we just get along
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Where did we go wrong,
Can we all just get along

Some set fire to crosses
Some fight the right to cross their dream
Some don't believe at all
But do anything to make the news

And when all the worlds collide
All they know is too divide
And it's easy if their faceless
To hate the other side
And the others caught between
Are the only ones to bleed
And the ones they leave behind
Can only sit and cry

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Mohammed
Can we just get along
Can we just get along
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Where did we go wrong,
Can we all just get along

Maybe if we'd work together
We'd already have a heaven here on earth

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Mohammed
Can we just get along
Can we just get along
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Where did we go wrong,
Can we all just get along

Dear God, dear soul
Dear Mary, Mohammed
Can we just get along
Can we just get along
Dear heart, dear life
Dear soldier, dear martyr
Where did we go wrong,
Can we all just get along
