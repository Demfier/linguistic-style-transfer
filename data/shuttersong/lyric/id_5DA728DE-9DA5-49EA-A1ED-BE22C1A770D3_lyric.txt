She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and
breezeblocks
Citrezene your fevers gripped me again

Never kisses all you ever send are fullstops
LA LA LA LA
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey
LA LA LA LA

Break down, now weep
Build up breakfast now lets eat
My love, my love, love, love...
LA LA LA LA

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear had gripped me but here I go

My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips my hand as my eyes shut
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Aaah, ah.

Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take our honey
LA LA LA LA
Break down, now sleep

Build up breakfast now lets eat
My love, my love, love, love...
LA LA LA LA
She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots

But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
LA LA LA LA
She's morphine queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love...
LA LA LA LA

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped my but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips my hand as my eyes shut
Oh, oh, oh

Aaah
Oh, oh, oh
Aaah
Oh, oh, oh
Aaah

Oh, oh, oh
Aaah, ah.
She may contain the urge to runaway
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germaline disinfect the scene
