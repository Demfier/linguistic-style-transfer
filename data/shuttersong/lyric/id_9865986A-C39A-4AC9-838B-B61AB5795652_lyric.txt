Beside You - 5 Seconds Of Summer
Within a minute I was all packed up
Got a ticket to another world
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
Sudden words are hard to speak
When your thoughts are all I see
"Don't ever leave " she said to me
When we both fall asleep underneath the same sky 
Say the beat of our hearts at the same time 
So close but so far away 
Can you hear me alie
She sleeps alone 
My heart wants to come home 
I wish I was  I wish I was beside you 
She lies awake 
I'm trying to find the words to say 
I wish I was  I wish I was beside you 
Another day  and I'm somewhere new 
I made a promise that I'll come home soon 
Bring me back  oh bring me back to you 
When we both wake up underneath the same sun 
Time stops  I wish that I could rewind 
So close but so far away 
One two can
She sleeps alone 
My heart wants to come home 
I wish I was  I wish I was beside you 
She lies awake 
I'm trying to find the words to say 
I wish I was  I wish I was beside get up
The pieces of us both
Under every city light
And they're shining as we fade into the night
She sleeps alone 
My heart wants to come home 
I wish I was  I wish I was 
She sleeps alone 
My heart wants to come home 
I wish I was  I wish I was beside you 
She lies awake 
I'm trying to find the words to say 
I wish I was  I wish I was beside you 
Beside you 
She sleeps alone 
My heart wants to come home 
I wish I was  I wish I was
