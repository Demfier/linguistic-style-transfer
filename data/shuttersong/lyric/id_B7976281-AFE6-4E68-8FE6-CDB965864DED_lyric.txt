I thought that dreams belonged to other men
Cause each time I got close
They'd fall apart again

I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could I have known
That all my life I only needed you

Whoa-oh
Almost paradise
We're knocking on Heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
Yeah, it's paradise

It seems like perfect love's so hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must've read my mind
And all these dreams I saved for a rainy day
They're finally comin' true
You know I'll share them all with you
Cause now we hold the future in our hands

Whoa-oh
Almost paradise
We're knocking on Heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
It's paradise

And in your arms salvation's not so far away
We're getting closer, closer every day

Almost paradise
We're knocking on Heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
It's paradise
Paradise
It's paradise
Paradise
