 I Won't Make A List And Send It
To The North Pole For Saint Nick
 I  Won 't Even Stay Awake To
Hear Those Magic Reindeer Click
'Cause  I Just Want You Here Tonight
Holding On To Me So Tight
What More Can  I Do
Baby All  I Want For Christmas Is You
You
All The Lights Are Shining
So Brightly Everywhere
 And The Sound Of Children's
Laughter Fills The Air
 And Everyone Is Singing
 I Hear Those Sleigh Bells Ringing
Santa  Won 't You Bring Me The One  I Really Need
 Won 't You Please Bring My Baby To Me
Oh,  I Don 't Want  A Lot For Christmas
This Is All  I'm Asking For
 I Just Want To See My Baby
Standing Right Outside My Door
Oh  I Just Want Him For My Own
More Than You Could Ever Know
 Make My Wish Come True
Baby All  I Want For Christmas Is
You
All  I Want For Christmas Is You Baby
All  I Want For Christmas Is You Baby
