yeah I remember a clumsy girl hiding behind glasses
I was just a lonely boy always skipping classes
Oh, we came from different worlds, it didn't slow us down

Who knew? Who knew?
I remember love like fire, hands held tight
I was barely getting by, but your eyes were lights

You decided to take a chance, take a chance on me

Who knew? Who knew?
(Yeah)
Who knew we'd grow up and out of this town
And all the places we'd go now?

Who knew the troubles we'd overcome?
Who knew?

Who knew the barriers we'd tear down?
And all the crowds we'd see gather round?
Who knew the life we would've found?

Who knew?
And if everyday you'd tell me

I wouldn't believe you

Who knew?
I remember railcars, and driving you to prom
So afraid I could barely speak, let alone dance
We never had much money to spend, that didn't slow us down

Who knew? Who knew? Yeah
I remember a girl with humble dreams, just hoping for the best

I was a boy with big intentions, the world on my chest
We never seemed to have much luck to spare
Oh, it would take us everywhere
Who knew we'd grow up and out of this town

And all the places we'd go now?
Who knew the troubles we'd overcome?
Who knew?
Who knew the barriers we'd tear down?

And all the crowds we'd see gather round?
Who knew the life we would've found?

Who knew?
And if everyday you'd tell me
I wouldn't believe you
Who knew?
We were just kids in love just wanting to fly
We never imagined it would take us this high
We're taking chances, oh that was just our way
And I found myself asking everyday
Who knew we'd grow up and out of this town
And all the places we'd go now?
Who knew the troubles we'd overcome?
Who knew?
Who knew the barriers we'd tear down?
And all the crowds we'd see gather round?
Who knew the life we would've found?
Who knew?
And if everyday you'd tell me
I wouldn't believe you
And if everyday you'd tell me
I wouldn't believe you
Who knew?
