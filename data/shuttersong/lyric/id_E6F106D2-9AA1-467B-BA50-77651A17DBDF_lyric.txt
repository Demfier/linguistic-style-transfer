Root Beer - George Jones
Well I sent my pretty baby to the neighborhood store
My head was vibrating from the night before
I said "You'd better hurry" as she went out the gate
My system needs a helper and I don't mean a steak
She had a cold six pack when she got back but it was
Ahhohhh hic-up Root Beer
Well now you can just imagine I was shocked to death
For nearly twenty minutes couldn't get my breath
My mind began to wonder
Would I ever get well 
If I leave it to my baby well you can't never tell
'Cause everything went numb
When I saw what she'd brung
It was
Ahhohhh hic-up Root Beer
Home brew lightning bay alcohol even good ol' Mountain Dew
Moonshine Grapevine any ol' kind would do
Well now you could be my doctor or my little nurse
But get me something quick before I die or get worse
I only need a toddy just a little drink
Yeah that should be enough to put me back in the pink
But everything went black when I looked in the sack it was
Ahhohhh hic-up Root Beer
Well I began to thinking: "I'd be better off dead"
But then I just remembered 'bout my ol' Uncle Ned
He's got a little business squeezing juice out of corn
And I began to praise the day my uncle was born
'Cause you can't get any kicks when you're in this fix out of
Ahhohhh hic-up Root Beer
Home brew lightning bay alcohol even good ol' Mountain Dew
Moonshine Grapevine any ol' kind would do
Well now you could be my doctor or my little nurse
But get me something quick before I die or get worse
I only need a toddy just a little drink
Yeah that should be enough to put me back in the pink
But everything went black when I looked in the sack it was
Ahhohhh hic-up Root Beer
Ahhohhh hic-up
