Tripping on the glances
Please take your time
But I won't be here forever
One for taking chances
But keep in mind
That I won't be here forever

And I'm all oooooooh
What's a girl to do
If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone but

If these tears were gasoline
I'd light a fire, make you notice me
Swim in a lightning storm to make you see
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me

Look at me
I'd walk a tight rope over stormy seas
I'd fight a lion, build a galaxy
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me

Like a supernova
You're blinding me
And we won't be here forever
When the day is over
Come look for me
'Cause we won't be here forever

And I'm all oooooooh
What's a girl to do
If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone but

If these tears were gasoline
I'd light a fire, make you notice me
Swim in a lightning storm to make you see
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me

Look at me
I'd walk a tight rope over stormy seas
I'd fight a lion, build a galaxy
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me

I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up

If these tears were gasoline
I'd light a fire, make you notice me

Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me

Gasoline
I'd light a fire, make you notice me
Swim in a lightning storm to make you see
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me
Look at me
I'd walk a tight rope over stormy seas
I'd fight a lion, build a galaxy
Nothing too crazy, if it makes you notice me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up
