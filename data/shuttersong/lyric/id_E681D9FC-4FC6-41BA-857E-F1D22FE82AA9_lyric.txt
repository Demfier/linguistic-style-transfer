What's that playing on the radio
Why do I start swaying to and fro
I have never heard that song before
But if I don't hear it anymore
It's still familiar to me
Sends a thrill right through me
Cause those chords remind me of the night that I first fell in love to

Those magic changes
My heart arranges
A melody that's never the same
A melody that's calling your name
It begs you please come back to me
Please, return to me
Don't go away again
Oh make them play again
The music I wanna hear is once again
Your whisper in my ear
Oh my darling, Ahhh, ahhhh

I'll be waiting by the radio
You'll come back to me someday, I know
Been so long since our last goodbye
But I'm singin' as I cry
While the bass is sounding, while the drums are pounding
Beatings of my broken heart will rise the first place of the charts

Oh my heart arranges
Oh those magic changes
Oooh oh ooh
Oooh oh ooh
Oh yeah
