Gotta slow up gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cuz if I don’t walk
I’ll keep messin’ around
And I’ll be fallin’ all the way down
(Hundred hundred hundred)
Hundred headlights making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once then I neva think twice
But your temptations making me stay another night
And my sense only lie to me lie to me
I don't know how I feel so raw to me raw to me
I gotta shut myself befo I get what I want
Find out it's not what I thought it was
And you know I gotta slow up gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cuz if I don't go then I get caught up
And all before and all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matta if I'm wrong or right
Cuz if I don't walk I'll get myself a round
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
Tell myself leave while I'm still strong
Going on back 'til I'm ten miles gone
And when the road stops I'm gonna keep goin'
Until I end up in the place that I belong
But the question's pushing me back again
Feelin' enough with the ten
There's even use even tryna get you out my head
So I lift my feet off the ground and I'm gonna walk right up
And you know I gotta slow up gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cuz if I don't go then I get caught up
And all before and all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matta if I'm wrong or right
Cuz if I don't walk I'll get myself a round
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
Won't get caught in the old flag trap
Run away run away never come back
No way I'm going down like that
No no run away run away
Won't get caught in the old flag trap
Run away run away never come back
No way I'm going down like that
No no run away run away
And you know I gotta slow up gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cuz if I don't go then I get caught up
And all before and all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matta if I'm wrong or right
Cuz if I don't walk I'll get myself a round
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
I'm gonna walk now
I'm gonna walk now yeah
