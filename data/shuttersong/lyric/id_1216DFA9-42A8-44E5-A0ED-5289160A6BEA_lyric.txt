"Take Me To The River"
(feat. BB King, Lenny Kravitz, Sheryl Crow)

[Al Green:]
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
Hey hey

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

[Lenny Kravitz:]
I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all those things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

[Sheryl Crow, Lenny Kravitz, Al Green, BB King:]
Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't take no more
Take me to the river

[BB King, Lenny Kravitz:]
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes you put me through
The sixteen candles burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know
Oh won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

One more time!

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground
Take me to the river
