BB Talk - Miley Cyrus\n Alright so this is really fucked up but\n Alright I was sleeping next to him\n But I was dreaming about the other dude\n And then all of a sudden\n Everything that he fucking did just made me cringe\n And it was so hard to fall in\n But so easy just to fall right back out again\n This whole time\n I could give to you and I could paint you pictures\n But I guess I could just never write a song\n And then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place\n I mean I I don't wanna feel this feeling\n Cause my energy's just so strong that\n I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what's mean to be\n And you know they say that you gotta think what you want into existence\n But you know what\n Haven't been too good at making decisions so\n I have no idea what the fuck I want I guess\n You're giving me a feeling in my head\n Laying in my bed just thinking\n Not really feeling like the one I want\n It's everything in me not to call him\n I really really really want it too\n I told all my friends I'm moving on\n Your baby talk is creeping me out\n Fuck me so you stop baby talking\n You know what in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies\n And shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking\n Baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat\n I mean even in front of your mom\n Dude as if I'm not fucking awkward enough\n I mean you put me in these fucking situations where\n I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch\n You know I I hate all that fucking PDA\n I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do\n You know it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead\n But you know what\n I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo\n You keep saying again and again\n We're laying in my bed just talking\n And now I now I can't hold it back\n I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit\n I don't really wanna you\n I heard I change my mind with you often\n Baby talk is creeping me out\n Fuck me so you stop baby talking\n Alright so I'm gonna be honest\n It's the super cutey shit that's the main issue here\n I mean I'm fucking what\n Look I like when you send me you know the\n The queen emoji but when I send back the monkey\n You know the ones with the the hands over the eyes\n That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me\n I mean I don't wanna say it person\n I just bury my head in your armpit which weirdly smells good\n And your hair and your fucking teeth\n Like why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do\n And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute\n Well that was kind of the best thing in the entire world\n You know maybe I could just get past this shit\n And I could get used to someone giving a fuck\n I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit\n I mean look I'm really starting to be in this whole thing\n But no matter what you do homegirl can't handle the fucking goo\n Fuck me so you stop baby talking\n Fuck me so you stop baby talking\n Fuck me so you stop baby talking\n Fuck me so you stop baby talking\n I don't really wanna you\n I heard I change my mind with you often\n Baby talk is creeping me out\n Fuck me so you stop baby talking
