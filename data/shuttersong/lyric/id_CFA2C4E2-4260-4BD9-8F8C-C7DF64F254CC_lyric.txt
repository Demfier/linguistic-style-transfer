#1:
You can get yourself into a fight
If that's the way you wanna live your life
You can get yourself connected
To the world that we are thrown to, yeah

Pre-- #1:
But all I need is somewhere to lay, somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be & someone to drive around town
I need someone to love when the chips are down

Reff #1:
Love me when the chips are down
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?

#2:
You can try & be someone you're not
If that's the river that you wanna cross
You can choose the life of a bohemian
Or you can choose the material world

Pre-- #2:
But all I need is somewhere to lay, somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I need someone to be, someone to drive around town
I need someone to love when the chips are down

Oh, yeah

Reff #2:
Love me when the chips are down, oh
Love me when the chips are down 2x
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?

All around...

(Bridge):
All I need is somewhere to lay, somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be & someone to drive around town
I need someone to love, one to love, one to love...

(Finale):
Love me when the chips are down, yeah
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Oh, oh
Love me when the chips are down 2x
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?
