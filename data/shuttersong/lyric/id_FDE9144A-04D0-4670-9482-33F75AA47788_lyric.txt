Tired of the rumors and lies
and holdin' inside
The things we think you should know
Honestly
Sick of all the games people play
and things that they say
So here you go, how about a little bit of
Honesty

Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking,
Stupid fucking, Stupid lies
Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking

Here's the fucking truth!

I did my time, In a Norwegian prison
I was forced fed fibrious foods
and prune juice forcing me to
shit out all my insides
Yes, I lost weight, I lost my dignity
I had hoses shoved in my butt
which really sucks
unless you're into that kind of thing
ohhhhhh, that sounds rought
We liked you better fatter
The sex was so much better
when you were fatter
Fuck you
You guys are pricks
I lost inches off my waist line

but added all those inches
to my dick

Why do people think I'm gay (he's not gay)
Why do people think I'm straight (he's not straight)
Why don't people understand
I make love in different way
I fall in love with things
that are not people
like rivers and forests
and churches with steeples
and butterfly kisses

and Hunger games sequels
Oh why can't you understand
all love is equal

Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking,

Stupid fucking, Stupid lies
Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking
Here's the fuking truth!

Tel 'em Daniel!

Ya'll think I'm stupid
Ya'll think I'm dumb
But when it comes to
who's the smartes
I'm the one
Energy is mass, times excelleration
according to Einstein's interpretion
Square of a hypotenuse
is equal to the sum of
the squares of the two other sides
Euclidean geometry, advanted trigonometry

a tisket, a tasket
I grasp all this math shit
I'm not MD not a PHD
But I'm gonna find a way to
feed the world with one Jelly Bean
Oh oh, one Jelly Bean, one Jelly Bean

I think it's kind of tragic
who I'm dating
Miley, Kendall, Kylie, Chloe
Taylor, Demi, Iggy, Nicki, Harry

I lie awake at night
and wonder if this pain I feel

Is temporary
You have my heart and have my soul
This world would not be quite so cold
with Harry
Haaarryyyyyyy

haha yayyyy bitches, this is Beau on the motherfucking mic
that's B-E-A-U motherfuckers

Ya'll got it twisted thinking
that I'm sweet and that I'm shy
but left the record show
Beau is not i nice guy
I double park and like to fart
When I'm in crowded cars
Burp in church and take a shit
up in your cookie jar

I bark at old ladies
like to scare babies
I never hold the door open cuz
I'm that crazy
Fuck Australia
Fuck the Janoskians fam
and now that I've got your attention
I quit this fucking band
Psych!

Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking,
Stupid fucking, Stupid lies
Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking
Here's the fucking truth!
Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking,
Stupid fucking, Stupid lies
Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking

Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking
Stupid fucking, Stupid lies
Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking, Stupid fucking
