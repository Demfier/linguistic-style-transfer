Well if you walk with me

Well if you take my hand babe

We can go to a place you ain¡¯t never seen before

Slow dance in the moonlight

I¡¯m just tryna set the mood right

I¡¯m just doing what I do Do it over and over and over

Quickly, thing, wanna run with me now

Swiftly just come with me now

Footsteps go to the beat now

Over and over and over

It¡¯s just the way that, the way that
The way that you do it, babe

Oh I can say that, say that, say that

I behave, but I¡¯d be lying babe

Feel a lil sober, got it mixed in my soda

I clean up good, aropa, dopa

Baby I¡¯m the shit but that¡¯s a good odor

I¡¯m a young star but my money look older

Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit

You hating on the internet, I couldn¡¯t even notice

Tickets no service, we at the top working

¡­is lurking, told her ¡°don¡¯t get nervous¡±

I don¡¯t swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby

Ferarri¡¯s and horses, I snap like Torres

No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important

I¡¯m all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi

9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe, tonight we gon¡¯ ball like Ginobili

Swiftly just come with me now

Footsteps go to the beat now

Over and over and over

It¡¯s just the way that, the way that
