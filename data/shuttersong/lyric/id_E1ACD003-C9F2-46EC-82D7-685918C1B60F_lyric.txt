Fine On The Outside - Priscilla Ahn

I never had that many friends growing up
So I learned to be okay with just me
Just me  Just me  Just me 
And I'll be just fine on the outside 
I like to eat in school by myself anyways
So I'll just stay right here
Right here  right here  right here 
And I'll be fine on the outside 
So I just sit in my room
After hours with the moon 
And think of who knows my name 
Would you cry if I died 
Would you remember my face 
So I left home 
I packed up and I moved far away
From my past one day 
And I laughed 
I laughed  I laughed  I laughed 
I sound fine on the outside 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oooh 
Sometimes I feel lost sometimes I'm confused 
Sometimes I find that I'm not alright
And I cry  and I cry 
And I cry
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oooh 
So I just sit in my room
After hours with the moon 
And think of who knows my name 
Would you cry if I died 
Would you remember my face
