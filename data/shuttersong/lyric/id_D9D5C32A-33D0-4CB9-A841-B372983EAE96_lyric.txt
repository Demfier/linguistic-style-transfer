I want to find this girl I know
I need to take her out
I set a snare in evening air
Made of faith and hope and doubt
I want to spend some time with her
Learn the secrets of her trade
I wouldn't mean to cross the line
And look into the other side
Forbidden to my kind
Forbidden to my kind

I need to hang out with my love
The raven-headed sprite
I know I'll never dance like her

Or keep her up at night

I need to hang around with her
I need to let her know
Her cause is mine
I'm but a slave

I look into her wondrous gaze
And taste the strangest core
And make the purest noise

What I would to do to meet the girl
I'd stand out in the rain

Outside my window watching close
She will appear again
Still polishing her crazy nail
Still whistling careless, drunken song
If I could only right my wrongs
And take her to my favorite place

And steal a melody

'Cause I need only see her face
And dance her worries all away
And music rushes in

Listen to the sound of life
Drink deep of the day
Wait for her but don't obsess
She'll go the other way
Winds will blow and storms will rage
The news is always sad
Money tends to disappear
Beauty crumbles with the years
Music is for us
Music is for us

What I would to do to meet the girl
I'd stand out in the rain
Outside my window watching close
She will appear again
Still polishing her crazy nail
Still whistling careless, drunken song
If I could only right my wrongs
And take her to my favorite place
And steal a melody
'Cause I need only see her face
And dance her worries all away
And music rushes in

If I could only see her face
And know that she was close
There is a deeper magic here
The everlasting muse
I'd love her danger for a night
I'd love her sadness for a day
I know that I am in safe hands
She pays the bill and smokes cigars
And on a napkin silk
She weaves her manuscript with skill
An intro, outro, middle 8
A tapestry of words
A subtle gift to modern rock
She says be popular, play pop
And you will win my love
A subtle gift to modern rock
She says be popular, play pop
And you will win my love
