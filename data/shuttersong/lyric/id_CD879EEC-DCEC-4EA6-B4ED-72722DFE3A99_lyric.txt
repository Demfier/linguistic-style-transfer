Jessie J, Sean Dun
If I go hard, let me tell you that it's worth it
Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it
Brush 'em right off, when they say I don't deserve it

Hands on my heart, you, you keep my fire burning
Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane

Here we are it's beautiful, I'm blown away
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life

In my fantasy we're running wild
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life

In my fantasy we're running wild
When it gets rough, then the rain starts pouring
I turn up the heat 'cause the drama ain't important
Let 'em all talk talk, I'mma just ignore it

Hands on my heart, you, you keep me moving forward

Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane
Here we are it's beautiful, I'm blown away
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
B.I.G. Sean Dun? Okay, today I woke up feeling like the mayor
I spend about an hour looking in the mirror
As I should, as much as I've been through it's a wonder, I look this damn good
I'll probably make it out any situation, that you try to put me into

If I swim with the piranhas it's guaranteed that Im'ma probably have a fish dinner
I meet a young girl with a sexy shape like Jessie J, we escapade
Where it's extra shape?
She make me want to give in not take like collection plates

Whoa all these wars, bras, cars, wall to wall was all a mirage
And I could lose it all tonight just to show the world I could do it twice, it's my life
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive

I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
Wild wild wi-wild woohoooh
Wild wild wi-wild woohoooh
Wild wild wi-wild woohoooh
Wild wild wi-wild woohoooh oh
