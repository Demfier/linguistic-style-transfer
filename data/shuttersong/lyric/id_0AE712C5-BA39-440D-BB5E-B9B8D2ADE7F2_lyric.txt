I feel a little lost in this world.
I try a little noise and choke.
I've honestly never felt this lone.
Oh, I just need someone.

I need a little room to breathe.
You're making this harder for me
when all I need is to be set free.
I need a little time to think.
And if you ever really loved me

Then all I need is a little room to breathe.
I've been through and seen a lot
Lived at the bottom and the top
We're on borrowed time, but time isn't enough.
I'm just trying to be the best me I can be
When I fall down it's just me and the ground.

I am no king, I have no throne.
I need a little room to breathe.
You're making this harder for me
when all I need is to be set free.
I need a little time to think.

And if you ever really loved me
Then all I need is a little room to breathe.
I need a little room to breathe.
I need a little room to breathe.
You're making this harder for me
when all I need is to be set free.
I need a little time to think.
And if you ever really loved me
Then all I need is a little room to breathe.
