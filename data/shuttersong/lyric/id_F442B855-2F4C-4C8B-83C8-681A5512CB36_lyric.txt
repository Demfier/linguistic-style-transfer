I got a drink in my hand,

and my homies do too

The vibe is in the air, I feel it

And all I know is these girls look good,

They're nice, young, I can't believe it

I love my life

I love my life

I love my life

I love my life

As long as she's wearing the sun dress,

and she smiles when I tell her Hello!

Yeah!

As long as my whips goes fast

and there's a little bit of hey in my coke

Hell yeah, I guess I can't really complain

Hell yeah, as long as I can say

I got a drink in my hand, and my homies do too

The vibe is in the air, I feel it

And all I know is these girls look good,

They're nice, young, I can't believe it

I love my life

I love my life

I love my life

It's doesn't take too much to please me,

It doesn't take too much at all

As long as my beat down low,

and my homies pick up when I call

Hell yeah, I guess I can't really complain

Hell yeah, as long as I can say

I got a drink in my hand, and my homies do too

The vibe is in the air, I feel it

And all I know is these girls look good,

They're nice, young, I can't believe it

I love my life

I love my life

No need for an early night,

Even though I've got another early flight

'Cause we've got the nine to five,

and the vibe tonight

Is feeling right on spot

We might be fading, I'm faded

Don't got problems, ain't complaining

We're alive, and that's great

Yeah, I'm just saying that I love my life

I got a drink in my hand, and my homies do too

The vibe is in the air, I feel it

And all I know is these girls look good,

They're nice, young, I can't believe it

I love my life

I love my life

I love my life
