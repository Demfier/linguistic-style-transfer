Get off of work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
it was two for one and four for two
and christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you.

I say hey hey baby do you want to come over
You say no way then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were in my T-shirt
right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses
Video, oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
You're moving around in the TV light
I aint ever seen anything like your dress my floor
No way you wore my T-shirt, Yeah
You look good in my T-shirt, oh yeah

We be walking up the stairs
with the neighbors saying keep it down
But its hard to unblock the door when you're making out
You be saying that we gotta quit doing this
So why you leaning in for one more kiss
and pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
and slipping in to my T-shirt

right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses
Video, oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
You're moving around in the TV light
I aint ever seen anything like your dress my floor
No way you wore my T-shirt
Yeah my T-shirt

Oh no baby no I can't lie
You sure look good in my T-shirt
Oh no baby no I cant lie
You look good on my mind

I say hey hey baby do you want to come over
You say no way then you move in closer
The next thing I know you are in my T-shirt
You just look so dang hot in my T-shirt

You see you're spinning around in my T-shirt
right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses
Video, oh-oh so hot in my T-shirt

right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses
Video, oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
