Yeah you
Yeah you
I used to want to be
Living like it's only me
And now I spend my time
Thinking about to get you off my mind
Yeah you
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike
Yeah you
Look at me now
I'm falling
Can't even talk  the stuttering
This cloud amor keeps shaking
Oh oh oh
All I want to be
All I ever want to be  yeah  yeah
Is somebody to you
All I want to be
All I ever want to be  yeah  yeah
Is somebody to you
Everbody's trying to be a millionaire
But everytime I look at you I just don't care
Cause All I want to be
All I ever want to be  yeah  yeah
Is somebody to you
Yeah you
I used to run around
I didn't want to settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face
Yeah you
I've got your photograph
But baby I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this
Yeah you
Look at me now
I'm falling
I can't even touch the sun ray
This cloud amor keeps shaking
Oh oh oh
All I want to be
All I ever want to be  yeah  yeah
Is somebody to you

All I ever want to be  yeah  yeah
Is somebody to you
