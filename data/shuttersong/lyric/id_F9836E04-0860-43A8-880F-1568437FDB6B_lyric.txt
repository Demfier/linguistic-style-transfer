Where did you come from
I wanna know
The way that you're moving

It's hard to move on
I can't help but feel
What I feel for you baby
I know we just met
But I hope you ain't taken
Senorita I wanna get to know ya
You got that kind of flavor
That I just wanna taste
And come back around
Baby I'm burning up like fire
You're hotter than Dubai
Together we can Burn this mutha fcka down
