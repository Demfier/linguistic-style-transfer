I want to leap over the buildings
Want to fly over the shores
Save the people from the villains
Catch the crooks who, rob the stores
Write my name upon the sky
And when you call me I'll be there
Faster then a lightning flash
Rushing through the cool night air
Ohh, ohh
So start ignition count to zero
I just want to be a superhero
Ohh, ohh
With fearless thoughts, emotions swirled
I want to be the man that, saves the world, yeah
The world is full of super problems
So we made up a superman
But he is just imaginary
And here we stand, without plan
With new ideas and innovation
Man still cannot tame creation
And though I'm told I'll never fly
That doesn't mean that I won't try
Ohh, ohh
So start ignition, count to zero
I just want to be a superhero
Ohh, ohh
With fearless thoughts, emotions swirled
I want to be the man that, saves the world
Ohh, ohh
So start ignition, count to zero
I just want to be a superhero
Ohh, ohh
With fearless thoughts emotions swirled
I want to be the man that saves the world
Ohhohoh...
