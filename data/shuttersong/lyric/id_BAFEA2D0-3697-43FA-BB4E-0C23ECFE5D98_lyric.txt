This what happen when I think about you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my play of ways got way to complicated for me.
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go, they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say that way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so

So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

Break it down, yeah
Yes sir, check

We use to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just left without my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man it's true, ex's change, yeah
Guess you changed for the better (better)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so

So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

For real shawty
Yeah I know

Yeah, is you at 2 Keys or Tin Roof?.
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe, I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
I'ma fuck you over, wanna fuck you over then again the truth
Cause I ain't really here to start problems
Girl I swear to God though, hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em \
