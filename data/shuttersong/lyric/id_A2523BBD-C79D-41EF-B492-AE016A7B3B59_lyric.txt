I closed my eyes, I built these walls
I made 'em 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall
When you're up so high and never wanna fall
I should've held a little back, but I had to give it all
So give it up up
All of your love, love
And don't run, run away
But if it's no, no
Then let me go go
Because there's nothing more then I can say
Because you set me on fire, fire
Your love is just like a flame
You're burning me on fire, fire
And I will never be the same
You burn me, you set me on fire, fire
You're playing your love games
You're burning me on fire, fire
And I will never be the same
So give it up up
All of your love love
And don't run, run away
But if it's no, no
Then let me go go
Because there's nothing more then I can say
Because you set me on fire, fire
Your love is just like a flame
You're burning me on fire, fire
And I will never be the same
You burn, you set me on fire, fire
You're playing your love games
Your burning me on fire, fire
And I will never be the same...
