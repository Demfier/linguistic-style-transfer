I used to be scared of the dick
Now I just don't give a shit
Libido like magneto - off and on, weak then strong
Dick ain't long? it's wrong
Can't fuck 'til dawn? yawn
Don't be mad that I fucked your dad
But your junk is sad
You know you ain't bad, for serious
Don't be delirious
Cock ain't right I'm not hearin it
Never fuckin ever fuckin nearin it
Cuz dudes ain't shit but balls and dicks
Prove your self worth, make the pussy hurt
Dirty
Get it strong and sturdy
I know you're pushing thirty, but if it ain't rock
Don't call this birdy

Your dick need miracle gro, I'm a miracle ho
Your dick need miracle gro
I am a miracle

Chicks want you to give em the spondolix for their wigs and ribbons
I'm not with 'em - my rhythm is too raw for these broads
At large and in charge, retarded artist
Go farther than fast cars, when I discharge I go the hardest like -
From green light to granite
From free flight to panic
Pay your duty to the booty, get snooty
Speak in tongues to the coochie
Make my face redder than rubies
He smoked a million doobies just to prove he got the bloodflow
I call him tonto
Floridian indian, rode him like a bronco yo
I'm getting lewd and sending nudes to your whole crew
