When darkness falls
And surrounds you
When you fall down
When you're scared
And you're lost, be brave
I'm coming to hold you now
When all your strength has gone
And you feel wrong
Like your life has slipped away

Follow me
You can follow me
And I will not desert you now
When your fire's died out
No one's there
They have left you for dead

Follow me
You can follow me
I will keep you safe
Follow me
You can follow me
I will protect you

I won't let them hurt
Hurting you, no
Ooh yeah
When your heart is breaking
