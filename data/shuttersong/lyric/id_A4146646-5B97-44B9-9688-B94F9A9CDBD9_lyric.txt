Now's time, get in line
Don't be afraid tonight
We're gonna take you high
And before you realise
'Round and 'round you'll go

Up and down, never slow
Feel the excitement grow, oh

Hands high like a roller coaster
This love is taking over
Take us higher, here we go
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were made for flying
We're about to lose control, oh

Oh, oh, hear us on your stereo
Oh, oh, we're about to lose control
