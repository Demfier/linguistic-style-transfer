This one goes out to my closest friends
The ones who make me feel less alien
I do not think I would be here if not for them
See all the nights in shitty bars
And throwing up in taxi cars
Or on our backs under the stars

As we sang
As we sing

What's another night on Mars?
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home

What's another night on Mars?
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
What's another night on Mars?

With friends like ours
Anywhere is home

What's another night on Mars?

(What's one more night?)
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
(When you are here under the stars)
What's another night on Mars?
(I hear you singing)

With friends like ours
(This is home, this is home, this is home)
Anywhere is home
……
The Earthlings crawl from bar to bar
Ignoring shooting stars
And grinding all the gears

The atmosphere here on Mars

Oh lord, it's quite bizarre
And will remain this way for years
And years and years and years
Yup
What's another night on Mars?

(Hello, Earthlings!)
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
(We all share the same sky!)
What's another night on Mars?

(It's quite bizarre, quite bizarre!)
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
(We're all Martians, the whole world)
What's another night on Mars?

(I need to hear it)
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
(Wouldn't you agree?)
What's another night on Mars?

(I don't know where you're going, but I hope you have the best time getting there)
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
(I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore)
