Ya know
All right, let's go

When the tide hits you straight in the face
Life is getting harder, treading water
Got no where to go
And as the time slips away day by day stranded in the ocean
Every open door has now been closed
Dead bolt, locked no escape

Feeling like an outcast
So out of place and I know
The tides might take you away
But don't you worry there's no hurry for tomorrow cause' today's still young
Now you hit rock bottom and you're feeling left at sea, yeah

Just keep your head above the water
And I know you'll find some way to breathe
When the tides they drag you down

When the tides they drag you down, down under
Further than you've ever been
Oh what I know
And when the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out, out so far
Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa (stream away from the bad tides)
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Yeah (only go where there's good vibes)
The good vibes

I knew I would choose positivity
And still I realise my life is so much more
I know this life aint what you bargained for
But honestly you never know
What life has got in store (yeah you never know)
Cause' everybody's gonna make it if they try

And if you persevere through your fears never hide
Fold your hands, send a prayer to the sky
And let your worries wash away with the tides
And I'm singing
Now you hit rock bottom and you're feeling left at sea, yeah

Just keep your head above the water, (above the water)
And I know you'll find some way to breathe
When the tides they drag you down

When the tides they drag you down, down under
Further than you've ever been
Oh what I know
And when the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out, out so far
Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa (stream away from the bad tides)
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Yeah (only go where there's good vibes)
And you gotta keep your chin up, (and you gotta keep your chin up)

Keep your head held high, (keep your head held high)
Just forget about the bad tides, (just forget)
Let em roll on by, (let em roll)
And you gotta keep your chin up, (yeah you gotta keep your chin up)

Keep your head held high, (let em know)
Just forget about the bad tides, (let em roll)
Let em roll on by, (let em roll)
When the tides they drag you down

When the tides they drag you down, down under
Further than you've ever been
Oh what I know
And when the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out, out so far
Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa (stream away from the bad tides)
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Yeah (only go where there's vibes)
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa (stream away from the bad tides)
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Yeah (only go where there's good vibes)
Stay away from the bad tides
Only go where there's good vibes
Haha, that's dope
