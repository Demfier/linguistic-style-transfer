You - The 1975
And you're a liar
At least all of your friends are
And so am I
Typically a child in my heart
It's my party
And I'll cry to the end
You must try harder
You're kissing all of my friends  you
Yeah  it takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
And you're alive
At least as far as I can tell you are
And so am I
You beat me down and then we're back to my car
And it's so ironic
How it's only been a year
And it's not my fault
That I've fucked everybody here
And it takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
And I said  "Do you wanna dance  Do you wanna dance 
Do you wanna dance some more in the back of the hall "
And I said  "Do you wanna dance  Do you wanna dance 
Do you wanna dance  dance in the back of the hall "
Yeah  it takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah  it takes a bit more than you
More  more
(Yeah  it takes a bit more)
(Yeah  it takes a bit more)
It takes a bit more
More  more
(Yeah  it takes a bit more)
(Yeah  it takes a bit more)
It takes a bit more
