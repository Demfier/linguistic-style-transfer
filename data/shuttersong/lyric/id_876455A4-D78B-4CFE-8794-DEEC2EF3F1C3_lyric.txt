Its the boy you never told I like you
Its the girl you let get away
Its the one you saw that day on the train
But you freaked out and walked away
Its the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
Things you swear youll do before you die
Its the city of love that waits for you
But youre too damn scared to fly

Hit the lights, let the music move you
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight
Hit the lights, let the music move you
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight
Its the time that you totally screwed up
Still youre trying get it out your brain

Its the fight you had when you didnt make up
Its the past that youre dying to change
Its all the money the youre saving
While the good life passes by
Its all the dreams that never came true
cause youre too damn scared to try
Hit the lights, let the music move you
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight

Hit the lights, let the music move you
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight
Its a mad mad world, gotta make an escape
Its a perfect world, when you go all the way
Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight

So lets go go go go
All the way, yeah lets go go go
Night and day, from the floor to the rafters
People raise your glasses

We could dance forever
Hit the lights, let the music move you
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight
Its a mad, mad world
Gotta make an escape
Its a perfect world
When you go all the way
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
