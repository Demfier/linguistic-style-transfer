Smell smoke, perfume, whisky and wine
And I'll drink down, oh I'm even blind
Before the flesh starts to wake up my brain
I love the way the girls call my name
Hit The brakes, screech til we pull up too
Amass for the bar just filled with a few
My hand gets pulled right straight through the crowd
Haha, well I'll saw you now

Baby I'll be on the road
Honey, I ain't coming home
Honey, I ain't coming home
I'm gonna be on the road
Honey, I ain't coming home
Baby, don't call my phone
Ain't come home
Ain't come home
I'm gonna be on the road

I'll never leave morning, I'm feeling bad
This two piece chain is driving me mad
Pick up my bag went straight for the door
Forgot to get the girl on the floor
Laugh and cries as I in Turin
The formal motive filled with a grin
Storage and joys go straight through the car
Haha, we love going far

Baby I'll be on the road
Honey, I ain't coming home
Honey, I ain't coming home
I'm gonna be on the road
Honey, I ain't coming home
Baby, don't call my phone
Ain't come home
Ain't come home
I'm gonna be on the road

I'm gonna be on the road
I'm gonna be on the road
I'm gonna be on the road
I'm gonna be on the road

I'm gonna be on the road
Honey, I ain't coming home
Baby, don't call my phone
Ain't come home
Ain't come home
