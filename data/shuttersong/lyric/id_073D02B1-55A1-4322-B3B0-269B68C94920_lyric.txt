If this was the last dance of the night
Will you join me 'til the morning light
Dance the night away, 'cause it feels right
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o

If this was the last dance of the night
Will you join me 'til the morning light
Dance the night away, 'cause it feels right
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o
You can't stop me, nooooo
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o

If this was the last dance of the night
Will you join me 'til the morning light
Dance the night away, 'cause it feels right
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o

24/7, 365 a year
And we know the end is near
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o

We rock it 24/7
Drag on 365
We keep on going and going how I knew it will never dies
Bring on a dumb, carry on and rock alive
You can't stop us no, no, no, no, no

We keep on going and going and going till the break of dawn
Nothing can't stop me, not even if the lights go on
One thing on my mind is "should get my party on"
You can't stop us no, no, no, no, no, no

If this was the last dance of the night
Will you join me 'til the morning light
Dance the night away, 'cause it feels right
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o
You can't stop me, nooooo
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o

You can't stop me, nooooo
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o

You can't stop me, nooooo
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o

24/7, 365 with you
We know the end is near
You can't stop me, no-o-o-o, no-o-o-o

You can't stop me, no-o-o-o
