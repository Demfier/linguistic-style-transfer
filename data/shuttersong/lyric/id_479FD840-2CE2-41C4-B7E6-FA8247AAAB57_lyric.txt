Wasted, wasted
A day's gone by
Waking up tired
Paycheck for the time

Here's to feeling stable
With all your cards on the table
Wake up, there's no last chance
Here's to acceptance

As the skin clings tightly to my back
I'm going nowhere fast
Leaving soon with a handful of regrets

Tasted, tasted
The smoothest skin
Waking up nauseous
From my own rhetoric

Here's to pissing on all fours
While sparing time until the last call
Face down in my own mess
Here's to acceptance

As the skin peels slowly from my back
I'm going nowhere fast
I'm tied down to an anchor in the past
Lying still with a mouthful of regrets
