Don't want the world to know I'm by myself
Don't the world to know I'm on your shelf
But if you want to try it on see for the night

Tell you I'll do things right
If you gon' run, slip for the knife
It's all a lie, and I wouldn't mind you'd run
Stay for the night, we've been alright
So long, there's no coloring around us anymore

You either know or you don't

Don't want the world to know it makes me weak

Don't want the world to know inside of me
I never even left, sleep for the night
Tell you I'll do things right
If you gon' run, slip for the knife
It's all a lie, and I wouldn't mind you'd run

Stay for the night, we've been alright

So long, there's no coloring around us anymore
You either know or you don't

Don't try strobe the storm
Sleep for the night
Tell you I'll do things right
If you gon' run, slip for the knife
It's all a lie, and I wouldn't mind you'd run
Stay for the night, we've been alright
So long, there's no coloring around us anymore
You either know or you don't
