Thinking Out Loud - Ed Sheeran
When your legs don't work
Like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth
Still remember the taste of my love 
Will your eyes
Still smile from your cheeks 
And  darling 
I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And  baby 
My heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout
How people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well  me
I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love
Right where we are
When my hair's all
But gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play
The strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul could never grow old 
It's evergreen
And  baby  your smile's forever
In my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people
Fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well  I'll just keep on
Making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But  baby  now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
That maybe we found love
Right where we are
So  baby  now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light
Of a thousand stars
Oh  darling  place your head
On my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love
Right where we are
Oh  baby  we found love
Right where we are
And we found love right where we are
