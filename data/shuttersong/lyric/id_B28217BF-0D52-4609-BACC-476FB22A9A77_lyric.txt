The used to say I'd never make it
And that's the reason that I will
And I ain't being cocky, I'm just tryna keep it real
As a kid I used to wonder how a million dollars feel
Now it's 30 shows a month, signing million dollar deals
All these dreams I was chasing, started in my basement
Now I'm on the road, killin shows around a nation
People used to doubt me, now they're slowly changing

I put em in their place like a real estate agent

Ha ha, man it's crazy how we came up

A year ago these people let it go and look my name up
Yea I got a dream, best believe that I'll pursue it
I swear I'll be the best to ever do it
‘Cause I'll be number 1 one day
No, I don't wanna forgotten
I'll be at the top someday
Number 2's just not an option
So everybody watch me, you know how it go
Yea I'm feeling good now, tell me how are you
I be livin life with my whole damn crew
‘Cause the number 1 rule is never be number 2, number 2 hey!
Yea, I'm the man around my city
I'm taking over the world, got the military with me

Yea we started from the bottom, now we worldwide known man
I'm famous on the internet, my lims are Google Chrome yea

I'm all over the web baby, you can call me Charlotte
20k a night, man I used to shop the targets

In Bang city, the second I arrived
Like he should adapt to it, this thing's a million lives
All these cameras get to flashin when I'm out in public

I came a long way from bagging groceries at Publix
But I was dreamin big so I had to go pursue it
I swear I'll be the best to ever do it
‘Cause I'll be number 1 one day
No, I don't wanna forgotten
I'll be at the top someday
Number 2's just not an option
So everybody watch me, you know how it go
Yea I'm feeling good now, tell me how are you

I be livin life with my whole damn crew
‘Cause the number 1 rule is never be number 2, number 2 hey!
(Bridge)
I won't stop til I'm the best

And I'll never settle for anything less
I won't stop til I'm the best, til I'm the best
And I'll never settle for anything less
I won't stop til I'm the best, til I'm the best
And I'll never settle for anything less
I won't stop til I'm the best, til I'm the best
And I'll never settle for anything less
‘Cause I'll be number 1 one day
No, I don't wanna forgotten
I'll be at the top someday
Number 2's just not an option
So everybody watch me, you know how it go
