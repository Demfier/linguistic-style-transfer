Hey little girl, is your daddy home
Did he go and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Uuh uuh, I'm on fire

Tell me now babe, is he good to you
Can do to you the things that I can't do
I can take you high
Uuh uuh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul

At night I wake up with the sheets soaken wet
Never felt a train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Uuh uuh, I'm on fire

Uuh uuh, I'm on fire
Uuh uuh, I'm on fire
Uuh uuh, I'm on fire
