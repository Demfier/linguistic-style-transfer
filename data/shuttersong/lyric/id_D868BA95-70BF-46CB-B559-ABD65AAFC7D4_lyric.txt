Lazy lover, find a place for me again,
You felt it once before,
I know you did,
I could see it.

Whiskey princess,
Drink me under, pull me in,
You had me at come over boy,
I need a friend,
I understand.

Backseat serenade,
Dizzy huricane,
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone,
You're salty like a summer day,
Kiss the sweat away,
To your radio.

Backseat serenade,
Little hand grenade,
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone,
You're salty like a summer day,
Kiss the pain away,
To your radio.

You take me over,
I throw you up against the wall,
We've seen it all before,
But this one's different,
It's deliberate.

You send me reeling,
Calling out to you for more,
The value of this moment lives in metaphor,
Yah, through it all.

Backseat serenade,
Dizzy huricane,
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone,
You're salty like a summer day,
Kiss the sweat away,
To your radio.

Backseat serenade,
Little hand grenade,
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone,
You're salty like a summer day,
Kiss the pain away,
To your radio.

Backseat serenade,
Dizzy huricane,
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone,
You're salty like a summer day,
Kiss the sweat away,
To your radio.

Backseat serenade,
Little hand grenade,
Oh aren't you sick of sleeping alone?
(Aren't you sick of sleeping alone?)
You're salty like a summer day,
Kiss the pain away
To your radio,
(Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone)
