[Verse 1:]
Theres a time when we all choose
To either quit or follow through
To just loose faith
Or trust your heart
To somehow lead you through the dark
You're not the only one who's dreamin'
And who needs help to carry on
We might get lonely but we're not alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus:]
Cause we are sisters
We stand together
We make up one big family though we don't look the same
Our spots are different
Different colors
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change
We're cheetah girls cheetah sisters

[Verse 2:]
Gotta do what we gotta do
Got the brains, got the power and we speak the truth
We're from everywhere all around the world
So ya best respect the cheetah girls
Dancing, singing from our birth
Working hard for what we deserve
Trying not to break the rules
'Cause mama didn't raise no fools
It may seem we're only dreaming
And we need help to carry on
Its good to know we're not alone

[Chorus:]
Cause we are sisters
We stand together
We make up one big family though we don't look the same
Our spots are different
Different colors
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change
Believe it mister
We're cheetah girls cheetah sisters

[Bridge:]
Someone's always there behind
To catch us if we fall

[Chorus:]
Cause we are sisters
We stand together
We make up one big family though we don't look the same
Our spots are different
Different colors
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change

Believe it mister
We're cheetah girls cheetah sisters
