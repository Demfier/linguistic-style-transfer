We'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never see the world like we do right now
So take in what's around you, put your camera down
Take a shot, give it all you got

I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Always looking forward, always looking back
They seem so near, but their not here

'Cause time moves on so quickly, without or with me
I've got to take a breathe

And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've got to pace myself, I'm always wondering, but I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go

We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life, the present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last right now
Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels

when your love is so exciting 'cause it's getting real
Have yourself listen to what's in your soul
That's your intuition and it always knows
Time moves on so quickly, without or with me

I've got to take a breathe
and slow down, slow down

My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've got to pace myself, I'm always wondering, but I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go

We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life, the present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last right now
Woah-o-woah-o-woah
Right now, right now
Enjoy the ride, the ride that you're on right now
Right now, right now
oo, oo-oo
Let go, let go
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life, the present is our future past
We've got to make this moment last... right now
