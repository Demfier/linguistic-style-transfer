Yo, my best friend, best friend 'til the very end
'Cause best friends, best friends don't have to pretend
You need a hand, and I'm right there, right beside you
You in the dark, I'll be the bright light to guide you

'Member the times, times, times sneaking out the house
All of the times, times, times that you had a doubt
And don't forget all the trouble we got into
We got something you can't undo, do

Laughing so damn hard, crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we shared, I promise, I swear

Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you

Wherever you go, just always remember
You never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

I know I drive you crazy, mm, sometimes
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times
But you complete me, and that's no lie
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bowtie

We in the car, sing, sing, singing our song
Walk in the building, tear it down like we King Kong
And in my eyes, you can do, do no wrong
You got the best friends sing, sing along

Laughing so damn hard, crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we shared, I promise, I swear

Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you

Wherever you go, just always remember
You never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

Ohh, I'll never let you go
Ohh woah, this is my oath to you
Ohh, just thought that you should know
Ohh woah, this is my oath to you, yeah

Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
Ohh, you should know, you should know
You should know, you should know, yeah
Ohh woah, this is my oath to you, ohh
Wherever you go, just always remember
You never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
