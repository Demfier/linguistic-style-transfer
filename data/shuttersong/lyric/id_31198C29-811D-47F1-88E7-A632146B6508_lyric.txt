Come here girl?
Oh you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying moving in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into
Das Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling \
