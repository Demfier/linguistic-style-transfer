Oooh oh
I fell in love with a criminal
She stole my heart and I didn't know
She got me hooked after just a touch
Like oooh she's so dangerous

She got me locked up, tossing the key
Even if I tried to run she wouldn't let me leave
This could be love, how could that be?
I'm falling for a perfect little heaven of a thief
Bringing me down, but bringing me up
Not the type of girl that you would ever wanna trust
Like oooh she's so dangerous

She's got a first time kiss that'll lock you in
She's gonna break your heart, but you can't resist
I know that I just met her
I know I should know better
Like oooh she's so dangerous

I thought she was just so innocent
and from the start, I was giving in
She's such a wreck and I can't forget
that oooh she's so dangerous

She got me locked up, tossing the key
Even if I tried to run she wouldn't let me leave
This could be love, how could that be?
I'm falling for a perfect little heaven of a thief
Bringing me down, but bringing me up
Not the type of girl that you would ever wanna trust
Like oooh she's so dangerous

She's got a first time kiss that'll lock you in
She's gonna break your heart, but you can't resist
I know that I just met her
I know I should know better
Oooh she's so dangerous
She's gonna let you down but you'll take her back
She's just a one way trip to a heart attack
I know that I just met her
I know I should know better
Oooh she's so dangerous

Was just a shot in the dark
Now, I don't know where it will land
I let her tear me apart, yeah
I wish it never began

She's got a first time kiss that'll lock you in
She's gonna break your heart, but you can't resist
I know that I just met her
I know I should know better
Oooh she's so dangerous
She's gonna let you down but you'll take her back
She's just a one way trip to a heart attack
I know that I just met her
I know I should know better
Oooh she's so dangerous
Oooh she's so dangerous
Oooh she's so dangerous
