It's too hot to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothing on me
And I can't take it no more
It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
Cause I gotta leave yeah

In the back of the cab
I tip the driver 'head of time
Get me there fast
I got your body on my mind
I want it bad
Oh just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high

Girl
You're the one
I want to want me
And if you want me
Girl you got me
There's nothing I
No I wouldn't do
(I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

Girl
You're the one
I want to want me
And if you want me
Girl you got me
There's nothing I
No I wouldn't do
(I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

Just to get up next to you

You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile
Down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear
