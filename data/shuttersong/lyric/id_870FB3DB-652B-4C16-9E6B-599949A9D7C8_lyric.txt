Cuz If I Dont Get Paid I Spray Like Air Freshners
A Lot Of Niggaz Sound Like I

If The Money Aint Straight
They Gunnin Them 38's
It's 17 Up In My Glock
4 Dutches A Box
4 Different Drugs They Sell In The Spot
N 9 1 1 Mean They Callin The Cops
We Get The 4 1 1 From The Fiend Off The Block
I Got A Spot Where Its 40 A Bag
Niggaz Old School Still Drink 40z
Keep Stows In They Rag
Bust Off The 40 Cal Soon As I Point At The Fag
So It Cost P Nuttin Just To 1 Ya Ass
