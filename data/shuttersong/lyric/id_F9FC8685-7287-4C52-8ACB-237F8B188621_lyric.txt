Walkin' out through a whole
Walkin' out through a whole
Near the tree is a clear sky from behind you

We people are searchin' our entire lives
We blong to our wanted lives
Running to catch a tide
We are animals that deserve to die alone

Every step is a fall
You are the whole if you recall
You can fix it if you don't want it

We people are searchin' our entire lives
We blong to our wanted lives
Running to catch a tide
We are animals that deserve to die alone

Can you sit down with your ear addicted to the fall?

With the sunset, it's a new world
We fear and then we suddenly smile
