Baby baby
Baby baby

You're the best present ever
Life's a snow globe when we're together
Like a Norman Rockwell picture
Baby baby, it's crazy how
We're walking around this frozen town
I'm wrapped up like a bulb
In your arms, shooting stars
Bouncing off the snowflakes
Falling down and decorating all the tangled lights
There's nothing like the silver nights with you

Streets are crowded, and stores are busy
Sipping cocoa, I'm just wishing
There'll be some mistletoe and you might kiss me
Walking around this frozen town
I'm wrapped up like a bulb
In your arms, shooting stars
Bouncing off the snowflakes
Falling down and decorating all the tangled lights

There's nothing like the silver nights with you

Uuuh uuuh uh uh uh
Uuuh uuuh uh uh uh
Uuuh uuuh uh uh uh
Baby baby
Baby baby
(I love the silver nights)
Baby baby
(Silver nights)

Baby baby
I love these silver nights

Walking around this frozen town
I'm wrapped up like a bulb
In your arms, shooting stars
Bouncing off the snowflakes
Falling down and decorating all the tangled lights
There's nothing like the silver nights
Nothing like the silver nights
Nothing like the silver nights with you
