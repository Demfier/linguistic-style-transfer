I turn up with my cap on back to front
Trying to be someone
Some TV wants
You were sitting by the window looking out for me
We were trying to find a way to say 'hi'
That didn't seem strange
But it didn't work out
Maybe that was just the way that it felt to me

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could me more than friends
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy

Walking home down the Uxbridge Road
Headphones on, I got a cigarette rolled
I know, I shouldn't light it
'Cause I haven't smoked one for weeks

Conversations running through my head
And I get stuck one thing
You should not have said what you said
And that was all I can think about

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could me more than friends
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy

Let's go find a corner we can sit in
We'll talk about the feelings that I've lost
Even though the word that I was thinking
I was gonna say I love you afterwards

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could me more than friends
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy

It's taken me so long (it's taken me so long)
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends (maybe too shy)
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy
It's taken me so long (it's taken me so long)
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy
We could me more than friends (maybe too shy)
Maybe I'm just too shy
Too shy
