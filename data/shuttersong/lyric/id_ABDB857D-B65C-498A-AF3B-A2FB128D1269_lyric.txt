That slow burn wait while it gets dark
Bruising the sun.

I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We've both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one.
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue.

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

People are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it.
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're all alone.
All my fake friends and all of their noise

Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night.

Maybe the Internet raised us,
Or maybe people are jerks.
People are talking, people are talking

(But not you)
People are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it.
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're all alone.
All the double-edged people and schemes.
They make a mess then go home and get clean.
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone,
we're all alone.
I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we're all get still (the people that talk, yeah, people that talk)

(The people that talk, yeah, people that talk)
Get still
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it.
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're all alone.
All the double-edged people and schemes.
They make a mess then go home and get clean.
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone,
We're all alone.
People that talk, yeah, people that talk, yeah
People that talk, yeah, people that talk, yeah
People that talk, yeah, people that talk, yeah
People that talk, yeah, people that talk, yeah
Let 'em talk
