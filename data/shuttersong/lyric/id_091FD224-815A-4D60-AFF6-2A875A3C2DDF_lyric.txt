From Louisville Kentucky name of Cassius Clay
Fought my way out to see another day
Seven to one odds against ol' Sonny Liston
Took my title from me but I kept on my mission

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
You know you've got me dancing
I'm the champion of the ring
You know my name
Is Muhammad Ali

No George Foreman ever called me a quitter
No Viet Cong ever called me a nigger
Threw my gold medal in the Ohio river
I won for the land of the free. Bumaye

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
You know you've got me dancing
I'm the champion of the ring
You know my name
Is Muhammad Ali

Yes my mind is free and all your love I'll never forget
Yes in time you'll see
I am the most beautiful
I am the most beautiful fighter yet

I know my destination and I know the truth
Yes I am the Louisville Lip that you've been talking to
All my life I've been dancing, like a rooster I will sing
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
You know you've got me dancing
I'm the world champion of the ring
You know my name
Is Muhammad Ali
