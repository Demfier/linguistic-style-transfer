This is gonna hurt
But I blame myself first
Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love
My head up
There's no forgetting you

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
(ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
More than the air that I breathed
(ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
Baby I loved you dangerously

Mmmm, mmmm I loved you dangerously ooohh

Usually I hold the power
With both my hands
Tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
Cause now you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I got nothing left

Cause I loved you dangerously
(ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
More than the air that I breathed
(ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
Baby I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see you now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know
There's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire and I'm gasoline

I love you
I love you
I love you

I loved you dangerously
(ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
More than the air that I breathed
(ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee)
Baby I loved you dangerously
Mmmm, mmmm
Oh, I loved you dangerously
Oh, oh, I loved you dangerously
